# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, writeBinaryFile, moveBinaryData.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Write Binary File (writeBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Move Binary Data (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Use Default Config (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a JSON configuration file for a standup bot. It starts with a manual trigger, sets default configuration values, converts them to binary data, and writes the binary file to a specified location.

### Demonstrate
A software development team might use this workflow to quickly generate and update configuration files for their standup bot, ensuring consistent settings are applied across all deployments without manual entry, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Insert a Set node to define configuration values (like tokens and URLs).
4. Add a Move Binary Data node to convert these values.
5. Use the Write Binary File node to save the configuration to a specified path.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that generates a CSV file instead of a JSON file. Use a manual trigger to input different data points (like names and emails) and save it as a CSV for a mailing list.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, enhance operational efficiency, and potentially offer automation services to clients, creating value and generating income through streamlined processes.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Use Default Config" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
