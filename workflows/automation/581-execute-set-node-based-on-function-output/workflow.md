# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Set1 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user manually triggers it, runs a function to generate two IDs, checks a condition, and sets values based on that condition. It essentially allows for simple decision-making and data processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer segmentation. For example, when a new lead is added, the workflow checks if the lead's ID matches certain criteria and then categorizes them accordingly, saving time on manual sorting.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n and add a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add a **Function** node to generate IDs (similar to the provided code).
3. Add an **IF** node to check if the ID meets a certain condition.
4. Use **Set** nodes to define values based on the outcome of the IF check.
5. Execute the workflow to see it in action.

### Practice
Try modifying the IDs generated in the Function node to create different scenarios. Change the conditions in the IF node to see how the workflow behaves with various inputs and outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate decision-making processes in your business, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract clients looking for efficiency solutions, potentially leading to income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
