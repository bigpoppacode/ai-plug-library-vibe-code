# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, if, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Check for Close Date (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set Close Date 3 Weeks Later (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Set Close Date (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set Close Date To Original (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the management of a "Close Date." It checks if a close date exists, sets a new close date three weeks later if it does, or keeps the original date if it doesn't, streamlining date management for tasks or projects.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate follow-up deadlines for sales leads. Instead of manually tracking and adjusting close dates, the workflow automatically sets reminders, ensuring timely follow-ups and increasing sales efficiency.

### Imitate
1. **Create a Manual Trigger Node** to start the workflow.
2. **Add an If Node** to check if a "Close Date" exists.
3. **Use a Set Node** to calculate and set a new close date if one exists.
4. **Add a NoOp Node** for flow control.
5. **Use another Set Node** to set the close date to the original if it doesn't exist.
6. **Connect all nodes** and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to set the close date to one week later instead of three. Execute the workflow and check if the date updates correctly based on the conditions you set.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate critical timelines in your business, reducing manual tracking. This efficiency can help you deliver better service to clients, allowing for more time to focus on growth and customer relationships, ultimately leading to increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set Close Date To Original" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
