# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, stackby.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Stackby (stackby)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Stackby1 (stackby)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data handling by triggering actions when executed. It sets values, interacts with a Stackby database to store data, and retrieves information, streamlining data management without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate data entry from a form submission into a Stackby database, eliminating manual data input and reducing errors, thus saving time and improving efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define values (e.g., ID, Name).
4. Add a **Stackby** node to save the data to a specific table.
5. Finally, add another **Stackby** node to retrieve data from the table.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the values in the **Set** node to different entries and executing it. Observe how the data is stored and retrieved in Stackby, reinforcing your understanding of the workflow process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you create automated solutions for clients, saving them time and reducing errors. This expertise can lead to new business opportunities, allowing you to charge for automation services and enhance your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Stackby1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
