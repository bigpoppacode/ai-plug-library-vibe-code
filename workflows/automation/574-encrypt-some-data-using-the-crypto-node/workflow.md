# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, crypto.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Crypto (crypto)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of verifying email addresses from an Airtable database using the Mailcheck service. When triggered, it checks each email's validity and updates the Airtable record with the results.

### Demonstrate
A marketing team could use this workflow to maintain a clean email list. By regularly verifying emails, they can reduce bounce rates and improve deliverability for their campaigns, ultimately leading to better engagement and customer acquisition.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set a trigger node (e.g., Schedule Trigger).
3. Connect to your Airtable account and specify the email table.
4. Add the Mailcheck node to verify the emails.
5. Use a Set node to format the results.
6. Connect the final Airtable node to update the records.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with a small sample email list in Airtable. Change some emails to invalid ones and see how the workflow updates the records, helping you understand the verification process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation skills, allowing you to offer valuable data hygiene services to clients. This could lead to recurring revenue opportunities as businesses increasingly rely on clean email lists for effective marketing.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Crypto" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
