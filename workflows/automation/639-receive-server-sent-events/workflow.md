# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving sseTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **SSE Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: SSE Trigger (sseTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the collection of customer feedback through a form, analyzes the sentiment using OpenAI, and logs the results in Google Sheets. It streamlines the process of gathering and interpreting customer opinions, saving time and improving insights.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer feedback analysis after a product launch. Instead of manually reading feedback, the workflow categorizes sentiment, allowing for quick adjustments to marketing strategies based on customer reactions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a feedback form using the form trigger node.
3. Connect your OpenAI account for sentiment analysis.
4. Link Google Sheets to store the feedback data.
5. Test the workflow by submitting the form and checking the Google Sheet for results.

### Practice
Try modifying the feedback form fields to capture additional data points (e.g., location or age). Then, run the workflow and see how the new data is logged in Google Sheets. This will help reinforce your understanding of data integration.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, saving them time and enhancing customer engagement. It positions you as a tech-savvy consultant who can help clients harness AI for actionable insights, potentially increasing your income through recurring service contracts.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "SSE Trigger" and "SSE Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
