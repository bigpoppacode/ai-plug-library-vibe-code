## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management in Wekan. It starts with a manual trigger, creates a board, adds lists ("To Do" and "Done"), and finally creates a task card to document actions, streamlining project organization without manual input.

### Demonstrate
A project manager can use this workflow to quickly set up a new project board in Wekan with predefined lists, ensuring that team members have immediate clarity on tasks and their statuses, saving time and reducing miscommunication.

### Imitate
1. In n8n, create a new workflow and add a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add a **Wekan** node to create a new board with a title.
3. Add multiple **Wekan** nodes to create "To Do" and "Done" lists under the created board.
4. Add a **Wekan** node to create a task card in the "To Do" list.
5. Connect all nodes sequentially and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the board title or adding more lists (e.g., "In Progress"). Execute the workflow again and observe the changes in Wekan to understand how the data flows and updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate project setups for clients, saving them time and effort. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase your income by providing valuable automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Wekan4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
