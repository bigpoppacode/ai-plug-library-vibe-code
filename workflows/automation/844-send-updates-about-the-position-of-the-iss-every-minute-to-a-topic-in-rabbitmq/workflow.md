# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving rabbitmq, set, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **RabbitMQ** node.
2. **Step 1: RabbitMQ (rabbitmq)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking the position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute. It retrieves the current latitude, longitude, and timestamp from an API, then sends this information to a RabbitMQ queue for further processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to track the ISS's position for educational apps, alerting users when it's visible in their area. It automates data retrieval and processing, saving time and enhancing user engagement.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron Node** to trigger every minute.
3. Add an **HTTP Request Node** to call the ISS position API.
4. Use a **Set Node** to format the data (latitude, longitude, timestamp).
5. Connect to a **RabbitMQ Node** to send the data to a queue.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log the ISS position data into a Google Sheet instead of RabbitMQ. This will help you understand how to change data destinations and adapt the workflow for different outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate real-time data tracking, a valuable skill for creating engaging applications. It opens opportunities for offering automation services, enhancing your marketability and potential income in the AI automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "RabbitMQ" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
