## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting podcast episode links from a webpage, fetching details from each episode, and generating an RSS feed. It starts with a manual trigger and ends with serving the feed.

### Demonstrate
A podcast creator could use this workflow to automatically update an RSS feed with new episodes. This saves time by eliminating manual updates and ensures listeners always have access to the latest content.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Modify the URL in the "Get overview page" node to your podcast's webpage.
3. Adjust the extraction parameters in "Extract links" to match your episode links.
4. Test the workflow and ensure the RSS feed generates correctly.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow to extract and serve data from a different webpage, like a blog. Change the CSS selectors in the "Extract links" and "Extract script" nodes to fit the new content structure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content distribution, saving time and increasing efficiency. As a consultant or business owner, you can offer this service to clients, helping them maintain their online presence effectively and potentially generating income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Serve feed" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
