# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, code, splitOut.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: PULL SUBITEMS (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: SPLIT SUBITEMS (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: GET EACH SUBITEM (mondayCom)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: MONDAY UPLOAD (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Convert to File (convertToFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: PULL LINKEDPULSE (mondayCom)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: GET ITEM (mondayCom)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: GET LINKEDPULSES (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: GET BOARD RELATION (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: COLUMN BY NAME (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: COLUMN BY ID (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: SPLIT LINKED PULSES (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing subitems in Monday.com. It retrieves subitems, processes them, and integrates various operations like uploading files and merging data, all triggered manually. Essentially, it streamlines project management tasks.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to automatically pull subitem data from Monday.com, convert it into a file, and upload it back to the platform. This saves time by eliminating manual data handling and keeps project updates organized and current.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Implement a **Code Node** to pull subitems from Monday.com.
4. Use **Split Node** to divide the subitems.
5. Add **HTTP Request Node** to upload files back to Monday.com.
6. Test and execute the workflow to automate the subitem management.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only pulls subitems from Monday.com and logs them in a Google Sheet. This will reinforce your understanding of data retrieval and integration within n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate project management tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, potentially leading to new income streams in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "SPLIT LINKED PULSES" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
