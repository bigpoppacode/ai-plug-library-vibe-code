# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving webhook, functionItem, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook. It acts as a live API endpoint.
2. **Step 1: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: SearchTorrent (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Start download (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Torrent not found (telegram)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Telegram1 (telegram)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: IF2 (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Start download new token (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of searching for torrents based on a title received via a webhook. It looks for available torrents, starts a download if found, and sends notifications via Telegram about the download status.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate downloading content (like movies) based on user requests, saving time and ensuring users are notified about the download status without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Webhook node to receive requests with a title.
2. Use a Function Item node to search for torrents with the given title.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to start the download if torrents are found.
4. Use IF nodes to check conditions and send Telegram notifications based on the results.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of the workflow that only sends a Telegram message when a title is received, without searching for torrents. This will help understand the webhook and Telegram integration.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, offering significant time savings and efficiency improvements. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions, potentially generating income through service offerings in automation and AI.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "Start download new token" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
