## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating an online event by integrating Zoom, Stripe, Google Sheets, and Gmail. It generates a Zoom meeting, sets up a payment link, stores participant data, and sends confirmation emails, streamlining event management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner hosting online workshops can use this workflow to automatically set up a Zoom meeting, create a Stripe payment link for attendees, and manage registrations without manual input, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure your Zoom, Stripe, and Gmail credentials.
3. Modify the "Config" node to adjust currency and email settings.
4. Test the "Creation Form" trigger to create a new event.
5. Review the workflow outputs to ensure data flows correctly into Google Sheets and emails.

### Practice
Create a simple test event using the workflow. Fill out the "Creation Form" with sample data (title, price, date) and check if the Zoom meeting is created, payment link generated, and confirmation emails sent to both teacher and participant.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer automation services to clients, saving them time and enhancing their operational efficiency. You can create value by streamlining event management processes, making you a valuable asset in the growing automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Create Zoom meeting" and "the end" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
