# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving readBinaryFile, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Read Binary File** node.
2. **Step 1: Read Binary File (readBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow reads a binary audio file (a .wav file) and sends it to an HTTP API for processing, specifically to transcribe audio using the Wit.ai service, allowing automation of audio-to-text conversion.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate transcribing meeting recordings or customer feedback calls into text, saving time and improving accessibility for team members who prefer reading over listening.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Read Binary File** node. Set the file path to your audio file.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node. Configure it to send a POST request to the Wit.ai API with the audio data.
4. Connect the two nodes, then execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the file path in the Read Binary File node to point to a different audio file and execute the workflow. Observe how the output changes based on the new input audio.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer audio transcription services, enhancing your automation business. This skill can attract clients needing efficient documentation of meetings or customer interactions, thus generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Read Binary File" and "HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
