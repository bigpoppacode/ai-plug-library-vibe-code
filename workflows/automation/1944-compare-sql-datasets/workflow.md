# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, compareDatasets, mySql.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Compare Datasets (compareDatasets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Orders from 2003 and 2004 (mySql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Orders from 2004 and 2005 (mySql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Change ordercount (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of comparing datasets from two time periods (2003-2004 and 2004-2005) and updates the order count. It starts when the user manually triggers it, retrieves order data from a MySQL database, and processes the information to generate insights.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to analyze sales trends over multiple years, identifying customer behavior changes and optimizing marketing strategies based on the findings, ultimately driving revenue growth.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up MySQL credentials to access your database.
3. Modify the SQL queries in the "Orders" nodes to reflect your data structure.
4. Adjust the comparison logic in the "Compare Datasets" node as needed.
5. Execute the workflow manually to see the results.

### Practice
Try changing the years in the SQL queries to analyze different time periods. Execute the workflow and observe how the order count changes. Experiment with adding additional metrics, like average order value, to enhance the analysis.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable insights into customer trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions. This skill can attract clients needing data analysis services, leading to increased revenue opportunities for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Change ordercount" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
