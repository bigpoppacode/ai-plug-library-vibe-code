# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving linearTrigger, filter, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Linear Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Linear Trigger (linearTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Only tickets that need to be classified (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Update team (linear)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get all linear teams (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set team ID (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Set me up (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Check if AI was able to find a team (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Notify in Slack (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Merge data (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the classification of bug tickets by integrating with Linear and OpenAI. It triggers on new tickets, checks if they meet specific criteria, and uses AI to determine the appropriate team for resolution, notifying them via Slack.

### Demonstrate
A software development team receives numerous bug tickets daily. This workflow helps the project manager automatically classify each ticket, assign it to the right team, and notify them through Slack, saving time and ensuring efficient handling of issues.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Linear Trigger** to start the workflow when a new ticket is created.
2. Use a **Filter** to select tickets needing classification.
3. Add an **OpenAI node** to classify the ticket based on its description.
4. Use a **Set node** to define team IDs based on AI output.
5. Notify the relevant team in Slack using the **Slack node**.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that triggers on a new email. Classify emails based on keywords, assign them to different folders in your email client, and send a notification to your phone or Slack about the classification.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate ticket management for clients, significantly improving their operational efficiency. This skill can help you attract new customers looking for streamlined processes, ultimately generating income as you offer automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Linear Trigger" and "OpenAI" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
