## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading an RSS feed every 5 minutes, extracting images and relevant data from new articles, and filtering only the new entries for further processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically gather and curate new articles from a tech news site, enhancing their content marketing strategy by posting timely updates on their blog or social media.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger every 5 minutes.
2. Add the RSS Feed Read node with your desired feed URL.
3. Use the Filter node to extract relevant data (title, link, author).
4. Implement the Function node to filter out already processed articles based on date.
5. Connect an action (like sending an email) to share new articles.

### Practice
Try modifying the RSS feed URL in the workflow to a different source and observe how the output changes. Test if the workflow correctly identifies and processes new articles.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline content curation for your business, saving time and enhancing your online presence, ultimately attracting more customers and generating income through automated engagement.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Only get new RSS1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
