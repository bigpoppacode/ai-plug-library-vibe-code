# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, splitInBatches, wait.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Webhook Callback Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Update finishedSet (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Initialize finishedSet (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Simulate Multi-Item for Parallel Processing (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: If All Finished (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Start Sub-Workflow via Webhook (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Acknowledge Finished (respondToWebhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Continue Workflow (noop) (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Call Resume on Parent Workflow (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Respond to Webhook (respondToWebhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process that starts with a manual trigger, loops through items to perform actions in batches, waits for responses via webhooks, updates a set of finished tasks, and sends acknowledgments. It efficiently handles multiple tasks in parallel, ensuring all processes complete before finalizing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer feedback processing. When a customer submits feedback, the workflow sends it for analysis, updates a record of finished tasks, and notifies the team once all feedback has been processed, streamlining operations and improving response times.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Use a "Split in Batches" node to handle multiple items.
3. Add a webhook to wait for responses from an external service.
4. Implement a code node to update a list of completed tasks.
5. Create a condition to check if all items are processed before sending notifications.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow that processes a list of emails. Use a manual trigger to input a list, loop through each email, simulate sending them, and wait for a confirmation response to track which emails were successfully sent.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate complex processes, save time, and improve efficiency for your clients. As a consultant, this skill can differentiate you in the market, allowing you to offer high-value automation services that can significantly enhance your clients' operational capabilities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Webhook" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
