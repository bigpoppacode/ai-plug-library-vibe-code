# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, chainLlm.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Prompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Auto-fixing Output Parser (outputParserAutofixing)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving and structuring information about the largest U.S. states and their cities using a manual trigger and OpenAI's language model for data processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly generate a report on the largest states by area, which can inform marketing strategies or geographical analysis for expansion plans.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Use a Set node to define the prompt for OpenAI.
4. Connect to the LLM Chain node to process the prompt.
5. Use Structured and Auto-fixing Output Parser nodes to format and validate the output.
6. Add OpenAI Chat Model nodes for additional processing if needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the Set node to ask for a different set of information, such as "List the top 5 smallest states by area," and observe how the workflow adapts to this new request.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data retrieval tasks, saving time and increasing productivity. This skill can attract clients looking for custom automation solutions, potentially leading to new business opportunities and income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "OpenAI Chat Model1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
