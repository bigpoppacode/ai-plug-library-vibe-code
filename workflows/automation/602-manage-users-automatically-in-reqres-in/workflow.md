# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: HTTP Request2 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a sequence of HTTP requests triggered manually. First, it fetches user data from a public API, then creates a new user with specified details, and finally updates that user's job title, demonstrating a simple data management process.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate user management tasks, like creating and updating user profiles in a database. For instance, a software company could streamline onboarding by automatically adding new employees to their system and updating job titles as needed.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch data (e.g., `GET https://reqres.in/api/users`).
4. Add another **HTTP Request** node to create a user (e.g., `POST` with body parameters for name and job).
5. Add a final **HTTP Request** node to update the user (e.g., `PATCH` with the new job title).
6. Connect all nodes and execute the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch data from a different API (like a weather API), and then update a Google Sheet with the fetched data. This will help you understand how to adapt workflows for various data sources.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate repetitive data management tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, ultimately increasing your income as a consultant or service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTTP Request2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
