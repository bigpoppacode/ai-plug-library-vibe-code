2. **Step 1: Gitlab Trigger (gitlabTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting customer feedback via a form, analyzing the sentiment using OpenAI, and logging the results into Google Sheets. It streamlines feedback management for businesses.

2. Connect your GitLab account for triggers.
3. Set up your OpenAI API credentials.
4. Configure Google Sheets with the desired format.
5. Test the workflow by submitting feedback through the form.

### Practice
Try modifying the feedback form to include additional fields (like a rating scale) and see how the workflow adjusts. Monitor the Google Sheets to ensure data is captured correctly.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
