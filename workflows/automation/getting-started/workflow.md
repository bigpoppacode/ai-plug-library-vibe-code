# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving functionItem, interval, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **FunctionItem** node.
2. **Step 1: FunctionItem (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: 2 hours Interval (interval)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where every 2 hours, it runs a function that sets variables, then stores one of those variables in a specified format. It's useful for tasks that require periodic data updates or automated processes.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update a dashboard every two hours with the latest metrics or insights, saving time and ensuring data is always current without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **2 hours Interval** node to trigger actions every two hours.
3. Add a **FunctionItem** node to set your variables (like `myVariable`).
4. Connect a **Set** node to store the output from the FunctionItem.
5. Deploy and test the workflow to ensure it runs as expected.

### Practice
Try modifying the **FunctionItem** to set different variables or change the interval to every hour. Observe how the changes affect the output in the **Set** node. This will help reinforce how data flows and is manipulated in the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, save time, and provide value to clients by ensuring their data is consistently updated. This can lead to new business opportunities and increased income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "FunctionItem" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
