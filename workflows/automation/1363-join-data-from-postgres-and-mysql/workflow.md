# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving webhook, mySql, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook. It acts as a live API endpoint.
2. **Step 1: emitirEtiqueta (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: dadosProduto (mySql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: PegarConfiguracaoImpressao (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: dadosRolo (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: trataRetorno (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: roloProduto (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating product labels by receiving data through a webhook, querying databases for product details, and merging the information for final output.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically print product labels as soon as an order is placed, ensuring accurate and timely labeling without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Webhook node to trigger on new orders.
3. Connect to a MySQL node to fetch product details.
4. Use an HTTP Request node to get printing configuration.
5. Query a PostgreSQL database for roll data.
6. Implement a Function node to process and format the data.
7. Merge results and send them to a printer or storage.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the SQL queries in the MySQL and PostgreSQL nodes to pull different product data, and test the workflow with various webhook payloads to see how it adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to streamline labeling processes, improve operational efficiency, attract new clients needing automation in their inventory management, and potentially create a profitable service around workflow automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "emitirEtiqueta" and "roloProduto" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
