# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Customer Datastore (n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Replace Me (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data processing by triggering on demand, fetching customer data, processing it in batches, making HTTP requests to an external API, waiting between requests, and performing a no-operation step as a placeholder.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automate sending personalized emails to customers in batches after retrieving their information from a database, ensuring efficient communication without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Connect to your **Customer Datastore** to fetch data.
4. Use **SplitInBatches** to process data one customer at a time.
5. Add an **HTTP Request** node to send data to an external API.
6. Add a **Wait** node to pause between requests.
7. Use a **NoOp** node as a placeholder for any future steps.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the HTTP request URL to send data to a different API, or adjust the batch size in the SplitInBatches node to see how it affects processing.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency, which can help you attract more clients and create value in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Replace Me" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
