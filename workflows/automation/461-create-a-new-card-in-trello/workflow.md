# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, trello.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Trello (trello)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user can manually trigger an action, which then creates a new card in Trello with a specified name and description. This simplifies task management and project tracking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly create Trello cards for new tasks or projects whenever they need to, streamlining project management and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node** to start the process.
3. Add a **Trello Node** to create a card.
4. Set the card's name and description.
5. Save and execute the workflow to see it in action.

### Practice
Try modifying the Trello card parameters (like adding a due date or assigning it to a member) and execute the workflow again to see how changes affect the card creation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and increasing productivity. This skill can help you attract clients needing automation solutions, ultimately generating income for your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Trello" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
