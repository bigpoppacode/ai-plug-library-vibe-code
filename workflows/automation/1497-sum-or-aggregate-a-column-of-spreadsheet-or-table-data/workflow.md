# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Mock data (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Summing function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user manually triggers an execution, generates mock data representing amounts in USD, and then sums those amounts to produce a total value.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate financial reporting. For instance, every month, they could execute it to quickly summarize sales data from mock entries, saving time on manual calculations.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Manual Trigger** node in n8n.
2. Add a **Function Node** to generate mock data (e.g., USD amounts).
3. Create another **Function Node** to sum the amounts.
4. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the total.

### Practice
Try modifying the mock data in the workflow. Change the amounts or add more entries, then execute it again to see how the total changes. 

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate financial summaries, enabling you to save time, improve accuracy, and offer valuable data insights to clients, which can translate into increased business efficiency and revenue opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Summing function" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
