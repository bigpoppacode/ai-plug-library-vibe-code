# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, jira.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Jira (jira)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a Jira issue. When activated manually, it sends a request to Jira to log a new issue with a specified summary and issue type, streamlining task management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to quickly log IT issues in Jira. For example, when an employee reports a firewall problem, the owner can activate the workflow to create a Jira ticket instantly, ensuring timely issue resolution.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Jira** node to create an issue.
4. Fill in the project name, summary (e.g., "Firewall on fire"), and issue type.
5. Connect the nodes and save the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the summary and issue type in the Jira node. Execute the workflow to see how it creates different issues based on your input, reinforcing your understanding of node connections.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate issue tracking, saving time and enhancing productivity. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient project management solutions, helping you establish a profitable automation service.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Jira" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
