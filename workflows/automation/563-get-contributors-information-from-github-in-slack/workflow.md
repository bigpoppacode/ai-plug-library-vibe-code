This workflow automates a process involving webhook, graphql, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook. It acts as a live API endpoint.
2. **Step 1: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: GraphQL (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Slack (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering GitHub user data through a webhook, querying GitHub's GraphQL API, processing the response to extract email addresses, and finally sending the information to a specified Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline onboarding by automatically retrieving team members' GitHub contributions and contact details, ensuring effective communication and collaboration without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Webhook node in n8n to trigger on incoming requests.
2. Add a GraphQL node to query GitHub for user details based on the webhook input.
3. Use a Function node to filter and format the email addresses from the response.
4. Connect a Slack node to send the formatted data to a specific channel.

### Practice
Try modifying the GraphQL query to pull different user data (like repositories or contributions) and observe how the output changes. Then, send this new data to your Slack channel to see the automation in action.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data retrieval and communication processes, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help attract clients looking for efficiency in their operations, ultimately enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "Slack" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
