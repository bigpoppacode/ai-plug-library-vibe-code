# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving function, set, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Function** node.
2. **Step 1: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking the position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute. It retrieves the current latitude and longitude of the ISS, filters out duplicate timestamps, and logs only new positions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position for educational purposes, providing real-time updates on its location for a space-themed app or website, enhancing user engagement and interest.

### Imitate
1. **Set up n8n**: Create a new workflow.
2. **Add a Cron node**: Configure it to trigger every minute.
3. **Add an HTTP Request node**: Set it to fetch ISS position data.
4. **Add a Function node**: Filter out duplicates based on timestamp.
5. **Add a Set node**: Extract and format the latitude and longitude for output.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log the ISS's position into a Google Sheets document instead of just filtering the data. This will help you understand data storage and retrieval in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection and processing, which can save time and reduce errors, making you more competitive in the automation market. This skill can attract customers looking for real-time data solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Function" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
