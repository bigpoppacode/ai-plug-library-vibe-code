# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving githubTrigger, if, slack.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Github Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Github Trigger (githubTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Slack - Add (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Slack - Remove (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates notifications when a GitHub repository receives a star. It triggers when a star is added or removed, checks the action, and sends a corresponding message to a Slack channel, allowing teams to stay updated on engagement.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to monitor their open-source project on GitHub. When someone stars it, the developer receives a Slack notification, helping them gauge interest and engagement, ultimately encouraging community involvement.

### Imitate
1. Set up a GitHub Trigger node to monitor your repository for stars.
2. Add an IF node to check if the action is "created" or "deleted."
3. For "created," add a Slack node to send a positive notification.
4. For "deleted," add another Slack node for a removal notification.
5. Test the workflow by starring and un-starring the repository.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send notifications to a different Slack channel or to include more details, such as the user who starred or un-starred the repository. This will help you understand how to customize notifications further.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer businesses real-time engagement tracking. By automating notifications, you help clients respond quickly to community interactions, enhancing customer relationships and potentially increasing engagement and contributions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Github Trigger" and "Slack - Remove" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
