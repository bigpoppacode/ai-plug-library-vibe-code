# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, editImage, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Edit Image (editImage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching a random image from an online source, editing its information, and preparing it for further use. It starts when a user manually triggers it, then retrieves an image, and finally edits its details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to create a daily social media post featuring a new image each day. Automating this process saves time and ensures consistent content delivery without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the automation.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch an image from `https://picsum.photos/200/300`.
4. Connect the output of the HTTP Request to an **Edit Image** node to modify the image’s details.
5. Save and execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the HTTP Request node to fetch images of different sizes or types (e.g., grayscale) and see how it affects the output in the Edit Image node. Document the changes and learn from the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate image sourcing and editing tasks, making you more efficient. This skill can attract clients looking for social media management or content creation services, potentially increasing your income through automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
