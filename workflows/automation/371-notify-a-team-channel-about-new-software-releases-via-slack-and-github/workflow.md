### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of notifying a Slack channel whenever a new release is made in a specified GitHub repository. It listens for release events in GitHub and sends a formatted message to a designated Slack channel containing details about the release.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with a software development team can use this workflow to keep their team informed about new releases, ensuring everyone is updated on changes and improvements without manual notifications, thereby enhancing communication and productivity.

### Imitate
1. Set up a GitHub Trigger node to listen for release events in your repository.
2. Add a Slack node to send messages to your desired channel.
3. Customize the message format to include relevant release details like the repository name, tag name, and release body.
4. Test the workflow by creating a new release in GitHub and checking for the message in Slack.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send notifications to a different Slack channel or adjust the message format to include additional details like the release date or contributors. This will help reinforce your understanding of customizing workflows.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate communication between development and operations teams, saving time and reducing the risk of missed updates. This skill can help you attract clients looking for efficient automation solutions, potentially generating income through service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Slack" and "Github Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
