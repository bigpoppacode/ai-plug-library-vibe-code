## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Shopify (shopify)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data retrieval from Shopify when triggered manually. It starts with a manual trigger and then retrieves all relevant data from a Shopify store, streamlining the process of data collection for business owners.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly pull product details from their Shopify store to analyze sales data or inventory levels without manually logging into Shopify, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node**.
3. Add a **Shopify Node** and set it to "getAll".
4. Connect the Manual Trigger to the Shopify Node.
5. Configure Shopify credentials and execute the workflow to retrieve data.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that retrieves customer data instead of product data. Use the manual trigger to test and see how the data flows from Shopify to n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive data retrieval tasks, making you more efficient. This skill can be marketed to businesses looking to streamline their operations, potentially generating income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Shopify" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
