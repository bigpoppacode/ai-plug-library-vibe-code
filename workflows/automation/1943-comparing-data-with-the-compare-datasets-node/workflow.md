# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, code, compareDatasets.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Dataset 1 (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Dataset 2 (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Compare Datasets (compareDatasets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the comparison of two datasets (fruits and their colors), highlighting differences and similarities. It begins with a manual trigger, processes two datasets using code, compares them, and then displays the results.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to analyze customer feedback data from two sources (e.g., surveys and social media) to identify trends or discrepancies, improving decision-making and customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Insert two "Code" nodes for Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, inputting relevant data.
4. Add a "Compare Datasets" node to analyze the outputs.
5. Use two "Sticky Note" nodes to summarize findings.
6. Execute the workflow to see results.

### Practice
Try modifying the datasets in the code nodes to include different items (like vegetables) and rerun the workflow to see how the comparison alters. Experiment with adding new fields to compare.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data analysis processes, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient data handling solutions, boosting your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
