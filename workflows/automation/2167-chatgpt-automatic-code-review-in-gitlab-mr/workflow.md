# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, webhook, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Sticky Note** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Code (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Split Out1 (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Get Changes1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Skip File Change1 (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Parse Last Diff Line1 (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Post Discussions1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reviewing code changes in GitLab. It captures data from merge requests, analyzes code differences, and generates AI-driven review comments, streamlining feedback for developers.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to automatically review code changes submitted via GitLab. Instead of manually checking each change, the workflow generates feedback, saving time and enhancing code quality.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the GitLab URL and token in the relevant nodes.
3. Set up a webhook to trigger the workflow on new merge requests.
4. Customize the AI prompts for code review feedback.
5. Test the workflow with a sample merge request.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a step that logs all review comments into a Google Sheet. This will help you understand how to adapt existing workflows and use data outputs effectively.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable automation consultant, enabling you to offer efficient code review solutions. This can lead to more clients, recurring income, and a stronger competitive edge in the software development market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
