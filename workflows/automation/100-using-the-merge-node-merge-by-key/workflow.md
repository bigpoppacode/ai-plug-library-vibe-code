# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving function, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Data 1** node.
2. **Step 1: Data 1 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Data 2 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Convert Data 1 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Convert Data 2 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data processing by collecting and transforming data from two sources, then merging them based on specific identifiers. It simplifies the task of integrating and analyzing information, making it easier for users to manage data effectively.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to combine interview data from a recruitment platform with employee details to create comprehensive reports. This saves time and ensures accuracy in candidate evaluations.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Data 1** node to input your first dataset (e.g., interview details).
3. Add a **Data 2** node for the second dataset (e.g., employee info).
4. Use **Convert Data 1** and **Convert Data 2** nodes to structure your data.
5. Finally, add a **Merge** node to combine the datasets based on a common identifier (like employee IDs).

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to pull data from different sources, like a Google Sheet or an API, instead of hardcoded values. Experiment with merging criteria to see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data integration tasks, making you more efficient and valuable as a consultant or entrepreneur. This skill can help you attract clients looking for data-driven solutions, ultimately leading to increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Data 1" and "Merge" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
