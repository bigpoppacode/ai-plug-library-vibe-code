### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of verifying email addresses from an Airtable database using Mailcheck. When triggered, it checks each email for validity and updates the Airtable records accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A marketing team can use this workflow to keep their email list clean. By regularly verifying emails, they reduce bounce rates and improve deliverability for their campaigns, leading to better engagement and ROI.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and Mailcheck accounts.
3. Modify the Airtable node to point to your email list.
4. Set up a trigger (e.g., schedule) to run the workflow automatically.
5. Test the workflow to ensure emails are verified and updated.

### Practice
Create a test Airtable base with a few email addresses. Run the workflow and observe how it verifies and updates the email statuses. Try adding invalid emails to see how the workflow handles them.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
