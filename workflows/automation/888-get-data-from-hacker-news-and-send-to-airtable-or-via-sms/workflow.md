## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the daily retrieval of the top three articles from Hacker News, extracts unique words from their titles, translates them into German, saves them to Airtable, and sends an SMS with the results.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create a daily vocabulary update for employees, enhancing language skills by providing new words and their translations, thereby improving team communication.

### Imitate
1. Set up a daily trigger in n8n.
2. Use the Hacker News node to fetch top articles.
3. Create a function node to extract and deduplicate words.
4. Integrate a translation service (like LingvaNex).
5. Save the results to Airtable.
6. Use an SMS service to send daily updates.

### Practice
Try modifying the translation step to send words in a different language. Experiment with the SMS message format to make it more engaging or personalized.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to efficiently automate content sharing, enhance communication skills, and provide valuable insights to clients, positioning you as an expert in practical AI solutions and increasing your service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Daily trigger" and "Send SMS" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
