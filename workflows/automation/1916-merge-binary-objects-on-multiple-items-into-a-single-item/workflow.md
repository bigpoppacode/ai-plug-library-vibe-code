# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, code, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set URLs (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Merge items (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading multiple image files from specified URLs and consolidating them for further use. It begins with a manual trigger, sets the URLs, makes HTTP requests to download the images, merges the downloaded data, and displays notes for clarity.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate the retrieval of product images from a supplier. Instead of manually downloading each image, the workflow fetches them all at once, saving time and minimizing errors in the inventory update process.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Code node** to set your image URLs.
4. Add an **HTTP Request** node to download images using the URLs.
5. Use another **Code node** to merge downloaded data.
6. Add **Sticky Note** nodes to document your process or results.
7. Test your workflow by executing it.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include URLs for your own images or files. Change the HTTP request to download a different type of file, like PDFs, and observe how the workflow handles them.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently automate data collection processes, making your services more appealing to clients. By saving time and reducing manual work, you enhance your value proposition, helping to attract new customers and generate income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
