# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Local Datetime (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain 
This n8n workflow starts when you manually trigger it. It then uses JavaScript to fetch the current local date and time, formatted for further use. This is useful for applications needing real-time timestamps.

### Demonstrate 
A business owner could use this workflow to log the exact time when a customer places an order. Accurate timestamps can help in tracking order history and improving customer service.

### Imitate 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Manual Trigger node.
3. Add a Function node with the provided JavaScript code.
4. Adjust the timezone in the code as needed.
5. Execute the workflow to see the current datetime output.

### Practice 
Try modifying the function to return the date in a different format (e.g., just the date or just the time). Execute the workflow to see if it works as expected.

### WIIFM 
Mastering this workflow helps you automate time-sensitive tasks, improving efficiency. It can attract clients needing precise time tracking, which is essential in industries like e-commerce and customer service.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Get Local Datetime" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
