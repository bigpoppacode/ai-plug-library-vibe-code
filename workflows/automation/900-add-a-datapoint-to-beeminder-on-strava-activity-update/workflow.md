# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stravaTrigger, beeminder.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Strava Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Strava Trigger (stravaTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Beeminder (beeminder)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of tracking new activities on Strava and logging them into Beeminder. When a new activity is created on Strava, it triggers the workflow, which then sends data to Beeminder to track goals related to fitness or activity levels.

### Demonstrate
A fitness coach could use this workflow to automatically log client workouts from Strava into Beeminder, helping clients stay accountable to their fitness goals without manual entry. This saves time and ensures accurate tracking.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Strava account and create a webhook in n8n.
2. Add a Strava Trigger node to capture new activities.
3. Connect a Beeminder node to log activity data.
4. Customize the Beeminder goal name and parameters.
5. Test the workflow by completing a Strava activity.

### Practice
Create a test Strava activity and observe if it triggers the Beeminder logging. Adjust parameters in the Beeminder node to see how different inputs affect the logged data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated fitness tracking services, enhancing client engagement and retention for fitness professionals. This skill can also lead to new business opportunities in fitness and health automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Strava Trigger" and "Beeminder" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
