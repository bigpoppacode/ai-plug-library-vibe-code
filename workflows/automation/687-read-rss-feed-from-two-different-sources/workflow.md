# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving rssFeedRead, manualTrigger, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: RSS Feed Read (rssFeedRead)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Code (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow reads RSS feeds from specified URLs, executes on demand, processes the data through custom code, and loops over items for further actions. It automates the collection and handling of feed data, making it easier to manage updates.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze blog updates from industry-related RSS feeds, allowing them to stay informed about trends without manual checking, ultimately saving time and improving content strategy.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert the **Code** node with your desired RSS feed URLs.
4. Connect the **RSS Feed Read** node to fetch data.
5. Use **Split in Batches** to process items and customize further actions as needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to read from different RSS feeds. Change the URLs in the **Code** node, and observe how the output varies with different feeds. Experiment with adding an action to send updates to your email or Slack.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate data collection and processing, making you more efficient and valuable as a consultant or business owner. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, enabling you to generate income through streamlined operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "RSS Feed Read" and "Loop Over Items" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
