# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, code, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sample data (name + language) (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sample data (greeting + language) (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Merge (name + language + greeting) (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging sample data about names, languages, and greetings. It starts with a manual trigger, generates sample data, and combines it based on the language to produce personalized greetings.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate personalized email greetings for customers based on their preferred language, enhancing customer engagement and experience without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Code** node for sample names and languages.
4. Insert another **Code** node for sample greetings.
5. Add a **Merge** node to combine data based on language.
6. Execute to see the output greetings.

### Practice
Try modifying the sample data in the Code nodes to include different names and greetings. Execute the workflow and observe how the merged output changes, reinforcing your understanding of data merging.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer businesses personalized communication solutions, increasing customer satisfaction and retention. This skill can lead to higher-value projects and recurring income in your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Merge (name + language + greeting)" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
