# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow triggers manually, then processes the current date and day of the week using a JavaScript function to create a structured output, which can be used in further automation tasks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate daily reports that include the current date and day, streamlining operations and ensuring timely updates for team meetings or client communications.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Function** node with the provided JavaScript code.
4. Execute the workflow to see the current date and day output.

### Practice
Try modifying the function code to include additional information, such as the current time or a greeting message, and re-run the workflow to see the changes reflected in the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enhances your automation skills, allowing you to create valuable tools for businesses. It can help you attract clients by offering customized automation solutions, potentially generating income through your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Function" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
