# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving bitbucketTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Bitbucket Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Bitbucket Trigger (bitbucketTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow uses a Bitbucket trigger to start an automation when changes are pushed to a specific repository. It helps developers monitor code changes without manual checks.

### Demonstrate
A developer can use this workflow to automatically trigger actions (like notifications or deployments) whenever code is pushed to a Bitbucket repository, ensuring timely updates and reducing manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add the Bitbucket Trigger node.
3. Set the event to "repo:push" for your specific repository.
4. Connect additional nodes for actions (like notifications).
5. Test the workflow by pushing code to Bitbucket.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include an action that sends a notification to your team via Slack whenever a new code push occurs. This will help you understand how to connect triggers to actions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you time and enhance productivity by automating code monitoring. This skill will attract clients looking for efficient development processes, allowing you to charge for your automation expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Bitbucket Trigger" and "Bitbucket Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
