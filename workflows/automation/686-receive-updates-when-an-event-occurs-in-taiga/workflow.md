# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving taigaTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Taiga Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Taiga Trigger (taigaTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates customer feedback collection by using a Taiga Trigger. When feedback is submitted, it sends the data to OpenAI for sentiment analysis and logs the results into a Google Sheet, allowing businesses to efficiently analyze customer satisfaction.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer feedback. For example, after a product launch, they can gather user opinions, analyze sentiment automatically, and maintain a record in Google Sheets to identify trends and improve services.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the Taiga Trigger with your project ID.
3. Set up your OpenAI and Google Sheets accounts in n8n.
4. Customize the feedback form to collect relevant customer insights.
5. Execute the workflow and test it with sample feedback submissions.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional fields in the feedback form, such as "Rating" or "Comments." Submit feedback and check if these new fields are correctly logged into Google Sheets alongside the sentiment analysis.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate customer feedback analysis, saving time and improving service quality. This skill can attract clients seeking to enhance customer engagement, enabling you to generate income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Taiga Trigger" and "Taiga Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
