# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving typeformTrigger, httpRequest, mindee.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get Receipt** node.
2. **Step 1: Get Receipt (typeformTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Extract Information (mindee)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set Information (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Store Information (airtable)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing receipts. It starts with a receipt submission via Typeform, retrieves the uploaded image, extracts key information using Mindee, organizes the data, and stores it in Airtable for easy tracking.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner wants to track expenses. Using this workflow, they can automate receipt collection from employees, extract details like amount and vendor, and store them in Airtable, reducing manual data entry and improving expense tracking.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform to collect receipt uploads.
2. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch the image from Typeform.
3. Use the Mindee node to extract relevant data from the receipt image.
4. Set the extracted data into variables using the Set node.
5. Store this information in Airtable for record-keeping.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow. Use a manual trigger to input a static receipt image, extract data using Mindee, and then log the results in a Google Sheet instead of Airtable. This will help you understand the data flow and node connections.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients, saving them time and reducing errors in expense tracking. This skill can help you attract more customers, generate higher income, and position yourself as an expert in AI-driven automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get Receipt" and "Store Information" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
