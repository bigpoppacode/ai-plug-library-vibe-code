# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set1 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Switch (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set2 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates tasks by executing a series of steps when triggered. It begins with a manual trigger, processes data using functions and sets, and decides paths based on conditions using a switch node, ultimately completing actions based on the outcomes.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline customer onboarding. When a new customer signs up, the workflow collects their information, processes it, and categorizes them based on specific criteria, automatically sending them relevant onboarding materials.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** to start the workflow.
3. Insert a **Function Node** to process incoming data.
4. Use **Set Nodes** to define specific data points.
5. Add a **Switch Node** to branch actions based on conditions.
6. Connect to **Action Nodes** (like sending emails or updating databases) for outcomes.

### Practice
Try creating a simple workflow that sends a welcome email to new subscribers. Start with a manual trigger, set their name in a variable, and use a function node to customize the email body before sending it out.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow means you can automate repetitive tasks efficiently, saving time and reducing errors, which is invaluable for businesses. This skill can differentiate you in the market, allowing you to offer high-value automation services to clients and generate income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
