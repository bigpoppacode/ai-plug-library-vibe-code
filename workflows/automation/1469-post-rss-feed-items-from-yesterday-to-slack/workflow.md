# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving function, cron, dateTime.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Build our message** node.
2. **Step 1: Build our message (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Every Morning (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get Yesterdays Date (dateTime)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Get the RSS Feed (rssFeedRead)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: If it was published after yesterday (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Post to Slack (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking an RSS feed for new posts published since yesterday. If any new posts are found, it formats a message and posts it to a designated Slack channel, providing a daily update.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically inform their team about new blog posts or news articles every morning, ensuring everyone stays updated without manual checks, saving time and improving communication.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a Cron node to trigger daily at your desired time.
3. Use a DateTime node to calculate yesterday's date.
4. Add an RSS feed node to read from your desired feed.
5. Implement an If node to check if posts were published after yesterday.
6. Add a Function node to format the message.
7. Use a Slack node to post the message to your channel.

### Practice
Set up the workflow using a different RSS feed (like a news site) and adjust the message formatting in the Function node. Test it to see if it correctly identifies and posts new articles.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate daily updates, improving productivity and communication for businesses. This skill can be monetized as a service, helping clients streamline their information dissemination processes, leading to potential income growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Build our message" and "Post to Slack" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
