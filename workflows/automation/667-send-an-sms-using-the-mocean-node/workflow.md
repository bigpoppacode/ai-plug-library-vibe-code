# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, mocean.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Mocean (mocean)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user manually triggers an action, which then sends a message via the Mocean API. It's designed to streamline communication, like sending SMS notifications or alerts, without requiring manual input each time.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to send automated SMS notifications to customers about order updates. For example, when a customer places an order, the workflow sends a confirmation SMS, improving customer experience without extra effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Mocean** node to send an SMS.
4. Configure the Mocean node with recipient number, sender ID, and message.
5. Execute the workflow to test it and ensure it sends the SMS correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the message sent via Mocean. Adjust parameters like the recipient number or message content, and test the workflow again to see how it behaves with different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate customer communications, saving time and enhancing customer satisfaction. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, creating opportunities for income in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Mocean" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
