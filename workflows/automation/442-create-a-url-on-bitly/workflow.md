# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, bitly.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Bitly (bitly)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of shortening a long URL using Bitly. When the user manually triggers the workflow, it takes a specified long URL and generates a shortened version, which can be shared easily.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly shorten URLs for marketing campaigns. Instead of manually using Bitly, they can automate the process, saving time and ensuring consistency in their marketing materials.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Bitly** node, configuring it with your Bitly API credentials.
4. Set the long URL parameter with a URL you want to shorten.
5. Connect the Manual Trigger to the Bitly node.
6. Execute the workflow to see the shortened URL.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding another Bitly node that takes the shortened URL and logs it to a Google Sheet. This will help reinforce your understanding of data flow between nodes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you time and effort in URL management. As a consultant or business owner, you can offer automated URL shortening as a service, enhancing your value proposition and attracting more clients.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Bitly" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
