# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, box.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Box (box)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a folder in Box when triggered manually. It starts with a manual trigger and then performs the action of creating a folder named "n8n-rocks" in the Box cloud storage service.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly set up a project folder in Box whenever they need to organize files for a new client or project, saving time on manual folder creation.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node**.
3. Add a **Box Node** to create a new folder.
4. Configure the Box Node with the folder name "YourFolderName".
5. Connect the Manual Trigger to the Box Node and save the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the folder name in the Box Node to create different folders based on project names. Execute the workflow multiple times to see how it dynamically creates new folders.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline file organization, which can improve efficiency in project management. This skill can attract clients who need help with automating their document management processes, thus generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Box" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
