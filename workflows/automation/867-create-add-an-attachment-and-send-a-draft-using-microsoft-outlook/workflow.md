## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending an email with a draft, attaching an image, and then sending the draft to a specified recipient. It uses Microsoft Outlook for email tasks and an HTTP request to fetch an image.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use the **Microsoft Outlook** node to set up the email draft (subject, body content).
4. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch an image URL.
5. Use another **Microsoft Outlook** node to attach the image and send the email to your desired recipient.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the email subject and body content. Test it by executing the workflow and checking if the email is sent correctly with the new details.

### WIIFM

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
