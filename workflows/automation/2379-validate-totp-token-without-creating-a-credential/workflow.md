# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, code, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: TOTP VALIDATION (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF CODE IS VALID (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: EXAMPLE FIELDS (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow validates a TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) code when triggered manually. It checks if the provided code matches the expected one based on a secret key, allowing secure two-factor authentication.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to enhance login security for their application. When users access sensitive areas, they enter a TOTP code generated on their mobile device, which the workflow verifies to ensure it's valid before granting access.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the process.
3. Insert a **Code** node for TOTP validation (customize the Python code with your secret).
4. Add an **IF** node to check if the code is valid.
5. Connect the output to actions (like sending a success/failure message).

### Practice
Try modifying the **EXAMPLE FIELDS** node to input different TOTP codes and secrets. Run the workflow and observe how it responds to valid and invalid codes, reinforcing your understanding of TOTP validation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer enhanced security solutions for businesses, making you valuable in the automation market. You can generate income by providing automation services that secure client applications against unauthorized access.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "EXAMPLE FIELDS" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
