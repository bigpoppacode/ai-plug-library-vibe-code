# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Split Up Binary Data (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Download Example Data (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Decompress Example Data (compression)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading a ZIP file, decompressing it, and splitting the data into individual binary items. It starts with a manual trigger and ends with organized data ready for further processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate data processing tasks, such as downloading customer files from a server, decompressing them, and preparing individual files for analysis, saving time and minimizing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert an **HTTP Request** node to download a ZIP file.
4. Use a **Compression** node to decompress the file.
5. Add a **Function Node** to split the data into individual items.
6. Connect a **Sticky Note** node to document each step for clarity.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to download a different ZIP file from the internet. Change the URL in the **HTTP Request** node and observe how the decompressed data is handled differently.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline repetitive data processing tasks, enabling you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, save time, and potentially generate income as a consultant or service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
