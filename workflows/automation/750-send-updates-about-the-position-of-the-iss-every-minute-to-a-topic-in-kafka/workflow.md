# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Kafka (kafka)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking the position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute, retrieving its coordinates, and sending that data to a Kafka topic for further processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position for a space-themed educational app, providing real-time updates to users about when the ISS will be visible from their location.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron Trigger** to run every minute.
3. Insert an **HTTP Request** node to fetch the ISS position from the specified API.
4. Use a **Set Node** to format the fetched data (name, latitude, longitude, timestamp).
5. Connect a **Kafka Node** to send the formatted data to a Kafka topic.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log the ISS position data into a Google Sheets document instead of sending it to Kafka. This will reinforce your understanding of how data flows through nodes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you build real-time data applications, making you more attractive to potential clients. By automating processes like these, you can save time and create scalable solutions, increasing your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Kafka" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
