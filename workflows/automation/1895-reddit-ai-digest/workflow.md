## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of searching Reddit for posts about "n8n," filtering relevant posts based on certain criteria, and summarizing them using OpenAI. It helps users quickly gather and analyze content from Reddit.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor discussions about their product on Reddit, ensuring they stay updated on customer sentiment and feedback, which helps in product development and marketing strategies.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** to start the workflow.
3. Use the **Reddit node** to search for posts with a keyword.
4. Add a **Set node** to store relevant data from the posts.
5. Use **IF nodes** to filter posts based on criteria (e.g., upvotes, date).
6. Summarize qualified posts with the **OpenAI node**.
7. Optionally, send results via email or another channel.

### Practice
Try modifying the keyword in the Reddit search node to see how it affects the results. Experiment with different filters in the IF nodes to refine the output based on your preferences.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate content monitoring for clients, allowing you to offer valuable insights and drive engagement, thereby enhancing your service offerings and increasing your revenue potential as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
