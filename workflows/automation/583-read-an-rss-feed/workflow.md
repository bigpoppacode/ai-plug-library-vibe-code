## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading an RSS feed when triggered manually. It starts with a manual trigger and then fetches the latest items from the specified RSS feed URL.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze content from industry-related blogs or news sites. This saves time by centralizing information without needing to check multiple sources manually.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **RSS Feed Read** node, input the desired RSS feed URL.
4. Connect the nodes.
5. Execute the workflow to fetch and review the RSS feed items.

### Practice
Try modifying the RSS feed URL in the workflow to a different source, like a news site or a blog relevant to your interests. Execute the workflow and observe the fetched items to understand how it works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content monitoring, providing valuable insights for your business or clients. This skill can help attract new customers by showcasing your ability to streamline information gathering processes efficiently.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "RSS Feed Read" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
