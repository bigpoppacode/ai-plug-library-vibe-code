# Generate Sql Queries From Schema Only AI Powered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving lmChatOpenAi, memoryBufferWindow, noOp.

## 💼 Business Use Case
This is a valuable tool for automating data transfer, lead management, or internal processes, saving significant manual effort.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Chat Trigger (chatTrigger)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
2. **Load the schema from the local file (readWriteFile)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
3. **Extract data from file (extractFromFile)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
4. **Combine schema data and chat input (set)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
5. **AI Agent (agent)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
6. **Extract SQL query (set)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
7. **Check if query exists (if)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
8. **Run SQL query (mySql)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
9. **Combine query result and chat answer (merge)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
10. **Format query results (set)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
11. **Prepare final output (set)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Add Trigger (If Needed):** If this workflow doesn't start with a trigger (like Schedule or Webhook), add one to automate it.
2. **Connect Credentials:** Go through each node and connect your accounts (e.g., Google, Airtable, OpenAI).
3. **Customize Parameters:** Review key nodes like "OpenAI Chat Model" and "Combine query result and chat answer" and update any placeholder IDs, table names, or URLs to match your specific needs.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
