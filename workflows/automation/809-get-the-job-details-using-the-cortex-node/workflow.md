# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, cortex.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cortex (cortex)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Cortex1 (cortex)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing URLs for potential abuse. When triggered manually, it sends a specified URL to Cortex for analysis, and then retrieves the results to check for any issues.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically check URLs submitted by users on their website. For example, if a user submits a link in a feedback form, the business can analyze it for safety, ensuring they only interact with legitimate links.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node as the starting point.
3. Insert a **Cortex** node to analyze a URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).
4. Add another **Cortex** node to fetch the analysis results.
5. Connect the nodes properly and execute the workflow to see the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the URL in the Cortex node to analyze different links. Test with various types of URLs (e.g., safe vs. suspicious) and observe the workflow's output to understand how it processes different data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer URL safety analysis services, enhancing the credibility of your business and attracting clients concerned about online safety. Automating such checks saves time and improves operational efficiency, increasing your value proposition.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Cortex1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
