# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, strava.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Strava (strava)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Strava1 (strava)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Strava2 (strava)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of logging a Strava running activity. When triggered, it creates a new run entry, updates it with a description, and retrieves the activity details, streamlining the management of personal fitness data.

### Demonstrate
A fitness coach can use this workflow to automatically log client runs into Strava after each session. It saves time by removing the need for manual entry, allowing the coach to focus on training rather than paperwork.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** to start the workflow.
3. Insert a **Strava Node** to create a run activity.
4. Add a second **Strava Node** to update the activity's description.
5. Finally, add a third **Strava Node** to retrieve and display the activity details.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the run's parameters (e.g., distance or elapsed time) and see how it affects the output. Execute the workflow multiple times with different values to understand its flexibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate fitness tracking processes, making you more efficient. As a consultant or business owner, you can leverage such automations to attract clients in the health and fitness industry, creating value and generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Strava2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
