## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates GitHub issue management by checking if an issue has an assignee. If not, it assigns the issue creator or commenter based on specific conditions, ensuring tasks are promptly addressed.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to automatically assign issues on GitHub, ensuring no tasks are overlooked, improving response times, and enhancing project management efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the GitHub trigger to monitor a repository.
3. Set conditions for assigning issues based on assignees and comments.
4. Test it by opening a new issue or commenting on an existing one.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional conditions, such as assigning issues based on labels or priority. Run tests to see how it reacts to different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you streamline project management in software development, increasing your value as a consultant or developer by offering automation solutions that save time and enhance productivity.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Switch" and "Github Trigger1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
