# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, coda, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Coda (coda)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting data when executed. It starts with a manual trigger, sets specified data values, and then sends that data to a Coda document, effectively streamlining data entry and management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate data collection from a form submission. Instead of manually entering information into Coda, they can execute this workflow, saving time and reducing errors in data entry.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Set** node, defining the data you want to store (e.g., names, dates).
4. Add a **Coda** node, configuring it to send the data to a specific document.
5. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the data in the **Set** node to include different values or additional columns. Execute the workflow and check if the updates reflect correctly in your Coda document, reinforcing your understanding of data flow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive data tasks, which can save time and reduce errors. This skill can enhance your service offerings, making you more attractive to potential clients seeking efficiency and reliability in their operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
