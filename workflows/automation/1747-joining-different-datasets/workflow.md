# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Note9 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Ingredients in stock from recipe (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Super Band (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: A. Ingredients Needed (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: B. Ingredients in stock (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Merge recipe (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: A. Ingredients (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: B. Recipe quantities (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: A. Queen (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: B. Led Zeppelin (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging ingredients needed for a recipe with those available in stock. It starts when triggered manually, gathers data from various sources, and combines them to ensure only the necessary ingredients are included.

### Demonstrate
A bakery owner could use this workflow to streamline inventory management. When a new recipe is created, the workflow checks available ingredients, ensuring only what’s in stock is used, reducing waste and improving efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Use **Code** nodes to input your ingredients and quantities.
4. Add **Merge** nodes to combine needed and available ingredients.
5. Execute the workflow to see the output of ingredients in stock.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to add a new recipe. Change the ingredients and quantities in the Code nodes, then execute it to see how the output changes based on your new inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate inventory checks, saving time and reducing errors in ingredient management. This skill can attract clients looking for efficiency in their operations, creating opportunities for income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "B. Led Zeppelin" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
