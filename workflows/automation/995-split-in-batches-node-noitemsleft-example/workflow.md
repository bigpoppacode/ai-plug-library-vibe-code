# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a manual trigger starts a series of actions, including generating items, splitting them into batches, checking conditions, and setting messages based on those conditions. It streamlines repetitive tasks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate reporting. For example, every week, a report could be generated and split into manageable sections, checking if any sections are complete before sending a notification about the remaining items.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use a **Function** node to generate items (e.g., an array of data).
4. Add a **SplitInBatches** node to handle items one at a time.
5. Implement an **IF** node to check if items are left.
6. Use a **Set** node to create messages based on the condition.

### Practice
Try modifying the **Function** node to generate a different number of items (e.g., 5 instead of 10) and observe how it affects the output. Also, change the message in the **Set** node to see how it alters the end result.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract clients looking for efficiency improvements, thereby increasing your income potential in automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
