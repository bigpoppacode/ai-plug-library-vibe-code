# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, set, graphql.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: GraphQL (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Item Lists (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Discord (discord)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving the top 5 posts from Product Hunt every hour, extracts relevant information, and sends it as a message to a Discord channel. It uses a Cron trigger to schedule the task, processes data via GraphQL, and formats the message for Discord.

### Demonstrate
A startup owner could use this workflow to keep their team updated on trending products in their niche. By automating this process, they save time and ensure they don't miss important industry developments, which can lead to better strategic decisions.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger hourly.
2. Use a GraphQL node to fetch data from the desired API (e.g., Product Hunt).
3. Implement an Item Lists node to structure your data.
4. Use a Set node to format the data for Discord.
5. Connect a Discord node to send messages to your channel.

### Practice
Try modifying the GraphQL query to fetch different data (like user reviews) and adjust the Discord message format to include this new information. Test the workflow to see how it updates your Discord channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data retrieval and communication, freeing up time for more strategic tasks. This skill can help you attract clients looking for efficient solutions, ultimately enhancing your service offerings and generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Discord" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
