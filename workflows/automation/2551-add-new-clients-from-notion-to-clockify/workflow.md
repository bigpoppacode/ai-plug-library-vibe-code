# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving clockify, notionTrigger, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Notion Trigger on new client** node.
2. **Step 1: Add client to Clockify (clockify)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Notion Trigger on new client (notionTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of adding new clients from Notion to Clockify. When a new client is created in Notion, the workflow triggers, adding that client to Clockify for time tracking, streamlining project management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to save time by automatically syncing client information between Notion and Clockify. Instead of manually entering client details into Clockify after they are added to Notion, this workflow does it automatically, reducing errors and administrative workload.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up Notion Trigger**: Create a Notion Trigger node that polls for new clients.
2. **Add Clockify Node**: Add an "Add client to Clockify" node, mapping the client's name from Notion.
3. **Connect Nodes**: Link the Notion Trigger to the Clockify node.
4. **Test the Workflow**: Run the workflow and add a new client in Notion to see if it appears in Clockify.

### Practice
Create a test database in Notion for clients. Use the workflow to add new client entries and check if they sync correctly to Clockify. Experiment with mapping different fields to see how it impacts the data transferred.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline client management processes, making you more efficient and reliable. This skill can attract more clients looking for automation solutions, potentially increasing your income as a consultant or service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Add client to Clockify" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
