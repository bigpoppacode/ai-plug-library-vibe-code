## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of web scraping by extracting country-specific data from a webpage, processing it, and storing it in a MongoDB database. It begins with a manual trigger, fetches HTML, extracts relevant data, and handles pagination before saving the results.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather and store banking information (like SWIFT codes) for various countries, allowing them to quickly access this data for financial services, compliance, or market research without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the manual trigger and set the initial URL to scrape.
3. Adjust the HTML extract node to target the specific data you need.
4. Set up MongoDB credentials and adjust the insert operation for your database structure.
5. Test the workflow by executing it and checking the MongoDB database for results.

### Practice
Try modifying the URL in the HTTP Request node to scrape a different website for similar data. Adjust the extraction logic accordingly and see if you can successfully store that data in your MongoDB database.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients needing data scraping services, enhancing your automation business’s value proposition and income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "MongoDB" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
