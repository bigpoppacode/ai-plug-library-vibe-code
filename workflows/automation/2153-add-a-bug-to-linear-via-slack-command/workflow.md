# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving webhook, httpRequest, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook. It acts as a live API endpoint.
2. **Step 1: Bug Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Hidden message to add bug details (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Create linear issue (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set me up (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Get all linear teams (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Get linear labels for a team (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Set team ID (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

### Workflow Breakdown Using EDIP Method

**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates bug reporting by capturing bug details via a webhook, sending a confirmation in Slack, creating an issue in Linear for tracking, and managing team and label settings for future reports.

**Demonstrate:**  
A software development team can use this workflow to streamline bug reporting. When a team member reports a bug in Slack, the workflow automatically logs it in Linear and prompts for more details, reducing manual entry and speeding up the resolution process.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to listen for incoming bug reports from Slack.
2. Use the HTTP Request node to send a confirmation message back to the Slack channel.
3. Create a Linear issue using the bug details captured from the webhook.
4. Utilize the Set node to configure team and label IDs for organizing issues.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a bug report to see it automatically logged in Linear.

**Practice:**  
Try modifying the workflow to add a new step that sends an email notification to the development team whenever a new bug is logged. This will help you understand how to integrate additional communication channels into your automation.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can help you create significant value for clients by automating their bug reporting process, saving time, reducing errors, and improving response times, ultimately leading to better software quality and customer satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Bug Webhook" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
