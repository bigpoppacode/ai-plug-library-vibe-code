# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving twitter, cron, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Twitter** node.
2. **Step 1: Twitter (twitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Mattermost (mattermost)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of searching Twitter for recent posts mentioning "n8n_io" every minute, processes the results to filter out duplicates, and sends the new tweets as messages to a Mattermost channel.

### Demonstrate
A marketing team can use this workflow to monitor mentions of their brand on Twitter in real-time. It allows them to engage with users quickly, improving customer relations and brand presence without manually checking Twitter.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger every minute.
2. Use a Twitter node to search for mentions of a specific keyword.
3. Add a Function node to filter out duplicate tweets.
4. Use a Set node to structure the tweet data for output.
5. Finally, send the structured data to a Mattermost channel using the Mattermost node.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that tracks a different keyword or hashtag on Twitter. Modify the Mattermost node to send notifications to a different channel or user. Test it by changing the keyword to see how it captures new tweets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide real-time social media monitoring services to clients, enhancing their engagement and responsiveness. This skill can differentiate you in the market and create opportunities for recurring revenue as a service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Twitter" and "Mattermost" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
