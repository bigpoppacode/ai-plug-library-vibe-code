1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Airtable (airtable)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting data from Airtable, generating visuals with Bannerbear, and organizing tasks in Trello. It starts when triggered manually, retrieves specific records from Airtable, creates images, and finally organizes those details into Trello cards.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline speaker submissions for a conference. When a speaker submits their info via Airtable, the workflow generates promotional graphics and organizes everything in Trello for easy tracking and management.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Connect to Airtable and configure it to list records based on a specific criterion.
3. Add a Bannerbear node to create visuals using data from Airtable.
4. Finally, connect a Trello node to create cards using the generated visuals and relevant details.

### Practice
Try modifying the Airtable query to filter records based on a different criterion, such as a specific date or status. Execute the workflow and observe how it affects the data flow and output in Trello.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save time and improve organization, helping you deliver projects faster. This skill is valuable for creating automated services for clients, potentially increasing your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Trello" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
