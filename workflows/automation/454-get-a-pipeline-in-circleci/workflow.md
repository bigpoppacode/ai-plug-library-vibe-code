# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, circleCi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: CircleCI (circleCi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of triggering actions when a manual execution is initiated. It connects to CircleCI, a continuous integration tool, to perform tasks like running builds or tests, streamlining development processes.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to automatically trigger a build process in CircleCI whenever they manually execute the workflow in n8n. This saves time and ensures that code changes are consistently tested without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **CircleCI** node and configure it with your project slug and API credentials.
4. Connect the **Manual Trigger** to the **CircleCI** node.
5. Save and execute the workflow to trigger a build in CircleCI.

### Practice
Create a variation of the workflow that triggers a CircleCI build with different settings each time it's executed. Experiment with modifying parameters to see how they affect the build process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline software development tasks, making you more efficient and valuable as a developer. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, potentially increasing your income through service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "CircleCI" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
