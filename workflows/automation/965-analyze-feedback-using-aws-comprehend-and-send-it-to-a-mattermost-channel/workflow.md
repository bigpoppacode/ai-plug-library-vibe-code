# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving mattermost, noOp, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Typeform Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Mattermost (mattermost)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: AWS Comprehend (awsComprehend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Typeform Trigger (typeformTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates customer feedback analysis. It collects feedback from Typeform, analyzes sentiment using AWS Comprehend, and if the sentiment is negative, sends a message to Mattermost, alerting the team.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically address negative customer feedback, ensuring timely responses and improving customer satisfaction without manually checking every submission.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform for feedback collection.
2. Use the AWS Comprehend node to analyze sentiment.
3. Implement an IF node to check if the sentiment is negative.
4. Use the Mattermost node to send alerts for negative feedback.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform to gather feedback, run the workflow, and submit responses to see how negative sentiments trigger alerts in Mattermost. Adjust the message format to personalize it.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide businesses with automated customer support solutions, enhancing their efficiency and responsiveness, which can lead to retaining customers and increasing revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Mattermost" and "Typeform Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
