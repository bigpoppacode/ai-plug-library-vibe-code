### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a WordPress post and then updating it with specific content. It starts when you manually trigger it, creates a new post with a title, and then updates that post with additional content.

### Imitate
1. Go to n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **WordPress** node to create a post, setting the title.
4. Add a second **WordPress** node to update the post with specific content.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see it in action.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional fields, such as tags or categories, when creating the WordPress post. Experiment with different titles and content to see how it affects the output.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
