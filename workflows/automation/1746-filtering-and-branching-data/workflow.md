# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Customer Datastore (n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Country equals US (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Country is empty or Name contains 'Max' (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Country based branching (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing customer data. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves customer information, checks conditions based on country and name, and routes the data accordingly, allowing for efficient data handling and decision-making.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to segment customers based on their location (e.g., US vs. others) for targeted marketing campaigns. This ensures tailored communication, enhancing customer engagement and conversion rates.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a manual trigger node.
3. Connect a customer datastore node to retrieve data.
4. Set up 'If' nodes to check conditions (e.g., country).
5. Use a 'Switch' node to route data based on conditions.
6. Execute the workflow to see how data flows.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow where you input customer names and countries, then categorize them into "US Customers" and "International Customers," logging results in a new node.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you provide value by automating customer segmentation, improving targeted marketing, and enhancing operational efficiency, making you attractive to potential clients looking to streamline processes.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Country based branching" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
