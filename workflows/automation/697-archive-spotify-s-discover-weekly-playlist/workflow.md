### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering Spotify playlists, retrieving their tracks, and saving them to an archive playlist. It runs weekly, ensuring your music library stays updated without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically archive their "Discover Weekly" playlist every week, ensuring they don't lose new favorite tracks while keeping their playlists organized and up-to-date without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. **Add Schedule Trigger**: Set it to run every Monday at 8 AM.
3. **Get Playlists**: Use the Spotify node to fetch user playlists.
4. **Find Specific Playlists**: Use conditional nodes to identify "Discover Weekly" and "Discover Weekly Archive."
5. **Get Tracks**: Retrieve tracks from the "Discover Weekly" playlist.
6. **Save to Archive**: Add tracks to the archive playlist.
7. **Test and Activate**: Run the workflow and ensure it works as intended.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to retrieve tracks from another playlist (like "Liked Songs") and save them to a different archive playlist. This will help you understand how to adapt workflows for different needs.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
