# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, cron.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Auth Wallabag (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Get stared articles (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Auth TTRss (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching articles from a Wallabag instance and a TTRSS (Tiny Tiny RSS) feed, merging the data, and sending it based on specific conditions. It can be triggered manually or via a scheduled cron job.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate content curation. For instance, they could gather and analyze articles from various sources to create a weekly newsletter, saving time and ensuring timely updates without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node as the starting point.
3. Use an HTTP Request node to fetch data from Wallabag.
4. Set up a Cron node to schedule automatic fetching every 10 minutes.
5. Incorporate a Function node to process the fetched data.
6. Add an IF node to check conditions for data processing.
7. Use a Merge node to combine data from different sources.
8. Finally, add an HTTP Request node for TTRSS authentication and fetching articles.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch data from a different API, such as a blog or news site. Change the HTTP Request node's URL and parameters, then test to see if the workflow successfully retrieves and processes the new data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you create valuable automations for clients, enhancing their productivity and operational efficiency. It positions you as a skilled consultant who can streamline content management processes, opening doors for new business opportunities and income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Auth TTRss" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
