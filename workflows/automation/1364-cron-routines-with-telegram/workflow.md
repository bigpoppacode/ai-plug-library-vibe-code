### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of cleaning an email list in Airtable using Mailcheck. It verifies each email's validity, updates the records, and ensures data hygiene, which is crucial for effective marketing and communication.

A marketing team could use this workflow to maintain their email list, reducing bounce rates and improving deliverability. By automating email verification, they save time and ensure they only target valid contacts for campaigns.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and Mailcheck accounts.
3. Set up a trigger (like a schedule or webhook).
4. Customize the Airtable nodes to match your specific email list table.
5. Execute the workflow to clean your email list.

### Practice
Try running the workflow on a small sample email list in Airtable. Verify the emails and check how the records are updated. Experiment with different triggers and parameters to see how it affects the outcome.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
