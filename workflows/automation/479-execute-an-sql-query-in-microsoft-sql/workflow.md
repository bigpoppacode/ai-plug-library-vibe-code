# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, microsoftSql.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Microsoft SQL (microsoftSql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger, allowing the user to execute it on demand. It then interacts with a Microsoft SQL database to execute a specified query, demonstrating how to automate database interactions without coding.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate data retrieval from their SQL database. For example, they can generate monthly sales reports automatically by executing this workflow, saving time and reducing manual errors.

### Imitate
1. Import this workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the Microsoft SQL node with your database credentials.
3. Define your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT * FROM sales WHERE date >= '2023-01-01'`).
4. Execute the workflow manually to see the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the SQL query to retrieve different data, like customer information or product sales. Execute the workflow and observe how the output changes based on your query.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data handling, saving time and improving accuracy in business operations. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient data solutions, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Microsoft SQL" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
