# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving awsSqs, set, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **AWS SQS** node.
2. **Step 1: AWS SQS (awsSqs)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching satellite position data from AWS SQS every minute, transforming it, and sending it to a specified destination. It uses HTTP requests to gather data and processes it for further actions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to track the real-time position of satellites for applications like telecommunications or GPS services. Automating data retrieval and processing saves time and ensures timely updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the AWS SQS node with your credentials.
3. Set up the HTTP Request node to fetch data from the satellite API.
4. Use the Set node to format the data as needed.
5. Schedule the workflow using the Cron node to run every minute.

### Practice
Try modifying the HTTP Request node to fetch data from a different API, such as weather data, and adjust the Set node to process this new type of data. Execute the workflow to see how it performs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate data collection and processing tasks, freeing up time for strategic activities. This skill is valuable for attracting clients who need efficient data management solutions, enhancing your service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "AWS SQS" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
