# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving github, function, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **GitHub Edit** node.
2. **Step 1: GitHub Edit (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Files (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Transform (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Create file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get workflows (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Get workflow data (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Download Raw Content (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: transform (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Daily at 23:59 (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Merge1 (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing GitHub files. It retrieves files, edits them, merges data, and saves the results back to GitHub daily at a specified time. This helps streamline code management and backup tasks.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to automate daily backups of their project files to GitHub, ensuring that any changes made are saved and documented without manual effort, thus reducing errors and saving time.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted).
2. Create a new workflow with a **Cron Trigger** set to run daily at 23:59.
3. Add **GitHub nodes** to get files, edit, and create new files as needed.
4. Use **Function nodes** to transform data between steps.
5. Test and activate the workflow to automate your GitHub file management.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of the workflow that only retrieves a file from GitHub, modifies its content, and saves it back. This will help you understand the flow of data and how to use n8n nodes effectively.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks in GitHub management, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, thereby increasing your income potential as a consultant or developer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "GitHub Edit" and "Merge1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
