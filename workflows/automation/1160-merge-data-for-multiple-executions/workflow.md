# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, rssFeedRead.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Merge Data (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: RSS Feed Read (rssFeedRead)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading RSS feeds, merging the data, and analyzing it in batches. It starts with a manual trigger, processes the data through various nodes, and uses conditional logic to manage the flow.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze content from specific RSS feeds (like competitors' blogs) to stay updated on industry trends without manual checking, saving time and ensuring timely insights.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Use a Function node to define RSS feed URLs.
4. Implement an RSS Feed Read node to fetch data.
5. Add a SplitInBatches node to process items individually.
6. Use an IF node to manage conditions and outputs.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the RSS feed URLs to your interests. Execute the workflow and observe how the data is processed. Experiment with different conditions in the IF node to see how it affects the flow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection and analysis, providing valuable insights quickly. This skill can attract clients seeking efficient data management solutions, ultimately leading to increased revenue for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "IF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
