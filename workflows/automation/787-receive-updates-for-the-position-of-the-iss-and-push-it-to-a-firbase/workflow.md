# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Google Cloud Realtime Database (googleFirebaseRealtimeDatabase)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of tracking the International Space Station (ISS) position every minute. It fetches the ISS's current latitude and longitude from an API and stores this data in a Google Cloud Realtime Database.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's location for educational apps or projects, providing real-time tracking for students or space enthusiasts, enhancing engagement and learning experiences.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger every minute.
2. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch ISS data from the API.
3. Use a Set node to extract latitude, longitude, and timestamp from the response.
4. Connect to Google Cloud Realtime Database to store the data.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that fetches weather data from an API every hour and logs it in a Google Sheet. Test it to see if data updates correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps students automate data collection and storage, saving time and improving accuracy, which is valuable for creating scalable solutions in various industries, enhancing their business offerings and increasing revenue potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Google Cloud Realtime Database" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
