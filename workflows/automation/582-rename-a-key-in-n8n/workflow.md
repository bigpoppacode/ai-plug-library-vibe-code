# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, renameKeys.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Rename Keys (renameKeys)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process that starts with a manual trigger. It sets a value, which is then renamed in the next step. This allows users to customize data flow easily, making it useful for various applications without needing coding skills.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate data entry tasks. For instance, when a new customer signs up, the workflow can set their details and format them for storage in a database, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define a key-value pair (e.g., key: "customerName", value: "John Doe").
4. Add a **Rename Keys** node to change "customerName" to "clientName".
5. Execute the workflow to see the result.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow where the manual trigger sets values for a product order, renaming them to fit your inventory system. Test it by executing and checking the output to ensure it reflects your changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you streamline data management processes in your business. By automating repetitive tasks, you save time and reduce errors, allowing you to focus on more strategic activities and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Rename Keys" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
