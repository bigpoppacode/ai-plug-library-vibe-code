# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where, upon manual execution, it sends an HTTP request to a specified API endpoint, allowing users to trigger actions without needing to manually interact with the API directly.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to retrieve user data from a web app. For instance, triggering a request to an API that fetches customer details when they want to analyze user engagement from their platform.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Insert an HTTP Request node.
4. Set the request type and URL to your desired API.
5. Configure any necessary authentication or parameters.
6. Save and execute the workflow to test its functionality.

### Practice
Try modifying the HTTP Request node to send a POST request to a public API (like a weather API) and log the response. This will help you understand how to handle different types of requests and responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you time and effort in data retrieval tasks, allowing you to offer automation services to clients. This skill can lead to new business opportunities and increased income as you streamline processes for various applications.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
