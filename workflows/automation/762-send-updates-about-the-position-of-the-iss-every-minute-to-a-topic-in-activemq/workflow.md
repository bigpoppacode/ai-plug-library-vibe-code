# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: AMQP Sender (amqp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the retrieval of the International Space Station's (ISS) position every minute. It fetches current latitude, longitude, and timestamp data via an HTTP request, processes it, and sends it to an AMQP server.

### Demonstrate
A business owner tracking satellite data could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position in real-time, enabling applications like educational tools, satellite tracking apps, or even space tourism planning.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Cron node set to trigger every minute.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch data from the ISS API.
4. Use a Set node to format the response, extracting latitude, longitude, and timestamp.
5. Add an AMQP Sender node to send the formatted data to a message queue.

### Practice
Try modifying the HTTP Request node to fetch data from a different API (like weather data) and send the results to a different destination (like a Google Sheet) to see how changes affect the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate data collection and processing, making you valuable in fields like tech consulting or automation services. It can lead to new clients, increased efficiency, and potential income through service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "AMQP Sender" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
