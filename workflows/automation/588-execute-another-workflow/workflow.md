### Explain
This n8n workflow automates processes by triggering an action when a button is clicked, executing a defined workflow. It allows users to streamline tasks without manual intervention, making automation accessible even for beginners.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline repetitive tasks, like sending a weekly report. By clicking "execute," they can trigger the entire reporting process, saving time and reducing errors without needing to run each step manually.

2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Connect it to an "Execute Workflow" node.
4. Specify the workflow ID you want to run.
5. Test the workflow by clicking "execute" to see it in action.

### Practice
Try creating a simple workflow that sends you a reminder email. Set up a "Manual Trigger," connect it to an "Email" node, and customize the email content. Execute the workflow and check if the email arrives successfully.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
