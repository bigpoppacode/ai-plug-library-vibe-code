# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, executeWorkflowTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: n8n (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Return (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get File (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: If file too large (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Merge Items (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: isDiffOrNew (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Check Status (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Same file - Do nothing (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: File is different (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: File is new (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Create new file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Edit existing file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Create sub path (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
22. **Step 21: Starting Message (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
23. **Step 22: Execute Workflow (executeWorkflow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
24. **Step 23: Completed Notification (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
25. **Step 24: Failed Flows (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
26. **Step 25: Get file data (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
27. **Step 26: Config (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up workflows to GitHub. It triggers manually or on a schedule, retrieves workflow data, checks for changes, and updates or creates files in a GitHub repository, while notifying the user via Slack about the status.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure all their automated processes are safely backed up to GitHub daily, preventing data loss and making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed, enhancing operational reliability.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** or **Schedule Trigger** to start the workflow.
3. Use the **HTTP Request** node to get the current workflow data.
4. Implement logic to check if the data is new or changed.
5. Use the **GitHub** node to either create or edit the file.
6. Add **Slack** nodes to notify about the backup status.

### Practice
Try running the workflow manually, then modify one of your existing workflows and run it again to see how the backup process handles changes. Ensure it creates or updates the corresponding GitHub file correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable backup solutions to clients, ensuring their automated processes are secure. This can differentiate your services, helping you attract more clients and charge premium rates for reliability and peace of mind.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Config" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
