# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, chatTrigger, toolCode.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Run SQL query (toolCode)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: DB Schema (postgresTool)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Get table definition (postgresTool)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates interactions with a PostgreSQL database using an AI agent. It listens for chat messages, executes SQL queries based on user input, and provides responses generated by OpenAI, enabling users to interact with their database conversationally.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create a customer support chat system. When customers ask questions about their orders, the AI agent retrieves relevant data from the database and provides instant answers, improving response times and customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **When chat message received** node as a trigger.
3. Connect a **Run SQL query** node to execute database queries based on user input.
4. Add an **OpenAI Chat Model** node to generate responses.
5. Configure a **DB Schema** node to understand the structure of your database.
6. Connect nodes to ensure data flows from the trigger to the response.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow. Use a manual trigger to input a SQL query and display the result in a message. Experiment with different queries to understand how the database responds.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate data retrieval for clients, enhancing their customer service capabilities. This skill can create value, attract customers seeking automation solutions, and potentially generate income through service offerings or consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note3" and "AI Agent" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
