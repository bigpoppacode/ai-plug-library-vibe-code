### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating a custom image using Bannerbear when a manual trigger is executed. It takes user-defined modifications, such as text and color, and creates a visually appealing image based on a specified template.

### Demonstrate
A business owner needs to create promotional graphics for social media. Instead of designing each image manually, this workflow allows them to quickly generate images with different messages and styles, saving time and maintaining brand consistency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node**.
3. Add a **Bannerbear Node**, configuring it with your Bannerbear credentials and desired template ID.
4. Set up modifications (text, colors) for the image.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to generate the image.

### Practice
Try modifying the text and colors in the Bannerbear node to see how different inputs change the output image. Experiment with different templates available in your Bannerbear account to understand how each affects the final product.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer customized image generation as a service, attracting clients needing quick, professional graphics. This skill can significantly enhance your value proposition and income potential in the growing automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
