### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting article titles and links from the Hacker Noon website. It starts with a manual trigger, then fetches the HTML content of the site, and finally extracts specific HTML elements (titles and URLs) from it.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor trending articles on Hacker Noon for content marketing insights. By automatically gathering article titles and links, they can stay updated on industry trends and share relevant content with their audience.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch data from a website (like Hacker Noon).
4. Use **HTML Extract** nodes to specify CSS selectors for the data you want (e.g., titles and URLs).
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the extracted data.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to extract data from a different website. Change the URL in the HTTP Request node and update the CSS selectors in the HTML Extract nodes to match the new site's structure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate data collection, saving time and effort. It enables you to provide valuable insights to clients or your business, enhancing your service offerings and potentially increasing your income through automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTML Extract1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
