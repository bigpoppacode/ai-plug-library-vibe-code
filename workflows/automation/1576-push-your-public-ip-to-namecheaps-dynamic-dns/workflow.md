# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, function, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Checks IP if new (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: subdomains (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Loops trough Subdomain list (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Send data to Namecheap (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get Public IP address (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: yourdomain.com (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking for new public IP addresses every 15 minutes, updates subdomains in Namecheap if a new IP is detected, and keeps track of previously seen IPs to avoid redundant updates.

### Demonstrate
A web hosting company can use this workflow to ensure their DNS records are always updated with the current public IP address, preventing downtime for clients with dynamic IPs and ensuring that their services remain accessible.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger every 15 minutes.
2. Use a Function node to check if the new IP is different from the last one.
3. Create another Function node to define your subdomains.
4. Loop through the subdomain list and prepare requests.
5. Use an HTTP Request node to update Namecheap with the new IP.
6. Retrieve your public IP using another HTTP Request node.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with a mock IP address and subdomains. Modify the subdomain list in the workflow to see how it affects the updates sent to Namecheap, ensuring you understand how each part interacts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients needing reliable DNS updates, helping you build a reputation as a solution provider and potentially increasing your income through automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "yourdomain.com" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
