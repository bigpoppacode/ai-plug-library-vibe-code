# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving github, cron, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get latest release** node.
2. **Step 1: Get latest release (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: No issue for release? (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Create issue (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: List issues (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking for new software releases on GitHub weekly. If no issues for the latest release exist in GitLab, it creates an issue, ensuring that software updates are tracked and managed efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to automatically monitor new releases and track related issues. This saves time and ensures that no updates are overlooked, improving team efficiency and project management.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Cron** node to trigger the workflow weekly.
2. Use the **Get Latest Release** node to fetch new releases from GitHub.
3. Use the **List Issues** node to check for existing issues in GitLab.
4. Add a **Function** node to determine if any issues exist for the new release.
5. If no issues are found, use the **Create Issue** node to log the new release in GitLab.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to check for releases daily instead of weekly. Adjust the **Cron** node settings and test if the workflow successfully identifies and logs releases in GitLab.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate tracking software releases, improving efficiency for clients. This skill could lead to high-value automation services, making your offerings more attractive and potentially increasing your income as a consultant or developer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get latest release" and "List issues" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
