## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates standup meetings in a team chat application (Mattermost). It collects user inputs, configures standup settings, and reminds members to participate, streamlining team communication and reporting.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automate daily standup reminders for their remote team, ensuring everyone reports their progress without needing manual follow-ups, saving time and enhancing accountability.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Webhook Trigger** for Mattermost commands.
3. Use **HTTP Request** nodes to fetch user data and send reminders.
4. Implement **Function** nodes to prepare messages.
5. Schedule the workflow to run at specific times.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only sends a reminder message to a Mattermost channel at a set time each day. Test it to ensure the reminder is posted as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automation services to clients, enhancing their operational efficiency while creating a recurring revenue stream for your business, making you a valuable asset in the automation landscape.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "publish report" and "Every hour" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
