# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, sentryIo.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sentry.io (sentryIo)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sentry.io1 (sentryIo)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating and retrieving releases in Sentry.io. It starts when you manually trigger it, then creates a release in Sentry, and finally retrieves all releases associated with your organization.

### Demonstrate
A software developer might use this workflow to automate release management. Instead of manually creating and checking releases in Sentry for each deployment, they can trigger this workflow to streamline the process, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the **Sentry.io** node with your organization details and project.
3. Set up the manual trigger node to start the workflow.
4. Execute the workflow and check Sentry for the new release and all releases retrieved.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional fields when creating the release in Sentry. For example, add a description or version number to see how it impacts the data stored in Sentry.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate release management in software projects, saving time, reducing manual errors, and providing a consistent deployment process, which can attract clients seeking efficient development practices.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Sentry.io1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
