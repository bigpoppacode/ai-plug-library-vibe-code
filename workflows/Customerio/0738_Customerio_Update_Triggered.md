# Customerio Update Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using customerIoTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Customer.io Trigger**.
  2. **Customer.io Trigger** `customerIoTrigger` — events: "customer.unsubscribed"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to notify you whenever a customer unsubscribes from your email list in Customer.io. It uses the Customer.io Trigger node to listen for "customer.unsubscribed" events. Once an unsubscribe event occurs, the workflow can be extended to perform further actions, such as logging the event, notifying a team member, or updating a database.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to maintain an up-to-date email marketing list by automatically removing unsubscribed contacts, ensuring compliance with email marketing regulations and improving the accuracy of campaign metrics.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Customer.io account.
3. Set the trigger event to "customer.unsubscribed."
4. Extend the workflow by adding nodes to log the event or notify your team.
5. Test the workflow with a sample unsubscribe event to ensure it functions correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple test in Customer.io by unsubscribing a test contact. Observe how the workflow triggers and consider adding a node to log the unsubscribe event to a Google Sheet for tracking.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you efficiently manage email lists, ensuring compliance and improving marketing efforts. Offering unsubscribe tracking and management services can increase your value to clients, leading to potential new business opportunities in email marketing automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** customerIoApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
