# Travel Advisory Monitor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Travel Advisory Monitor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/travel_advisory_monitor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "travel_advisory_monitor"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "travel_advisory_monitor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow monitors travel advisories by receiving data via a webhook, processing it through a series of steps including inserting and querying a vector store (Pinecone), using AI tools for analysis, and finally logging the results in a Google Sheet. It ensures that travel advisory data is efficiently stored, analyzed, and recorded for further use.

### Demonstrate
A travel agency could use this workflow to automatically update their system with the latest travel advisories, helping them provide timely advice to clients and ensure safe travel planning.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive travel advisory data.
3. Connect to Pinecone for vector storage and querying.
4. Use AI tools to analyze the data.
5. Log the results in a Google Sheet.
6. Test the workflow to confirm it processes and logs advisories correctly.

### Practice
Create a mock travel advisory JSON and use the webhook to test the workflow. Check the Google Sheet to see if the advisory data is correctly logged and analyzed, adjusting the setup as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer travel advisory monitoring services, providing clients with real-time updates and insights. This could enhance your service offerings in the travel industry, leading to increased client satisfaction and potential new business opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
