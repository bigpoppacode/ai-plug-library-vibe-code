# Currency Exchange Estimator
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Currency Exchange Estimator", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/currency_exchange_estimator`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "currency_exchange_estimator"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "currency_exchange_estimator"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of estimating currency exchanges by leveraging AI and vector databases. It starts with a webhook to receive input data, processes the input using a text splitter and embeddings, stores and queries data in a vector database called Weaviate, and uses AI to generate responses. The results are logged in Google Sheets for record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A financial consultant could use this workflow to provide real-time currency exchange estimates to clients, enhancing service delivery and decision-making without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Weaviate and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up the webhook trigger to receive data.
4. Test the workflow with sample currency data.
5. Verify data storage, retrieval, and logging in Google Sheets.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by submitting sample currency exchange data through the webhook. Analyze how the workflow processes the input, interacts with the vector database, and logs results. Adjust parameters to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer AI-driven financial insights, attracting clients seeking automated solutions. This can expand your service offerings, improve client satisfaction, and increase revenue in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
