# Visa Requirement Checker
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Visa Requirement Checker", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/visa_requirement_checker`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "visa_requirement_checker"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "visa_requirement_checker"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow acts as a Visa Requirement Checker. It receives user queries via a webhook, processes the text into manageable chunks, and uses AI to generate embeddings, which are stored in a Weaviate vector database. The workflow queries the database, uses AI to define visa requirements, and logs the output to a Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A travel agency could use this workflow to quickly check visa requirements for clients, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is provided, enhancing customer service and reducing manual lookup effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Weaviate and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set the webhook to receive queries.
4. Ensure your text and vector database settings match your visa requirement data.
5. Test the workflow to verify it logs the correct information.

### Practice
Create a test query with sample visa requirement data. Run it through the workflow and check the Google Sheet for correct logging. Modify data and observe changes in results to understand the workflow’s behavior.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline visa checks, making you a valuable partner for travel agencies or businesses needing efficient visa processing. Offering this as a service can attract clients and increase your income in the AI automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
