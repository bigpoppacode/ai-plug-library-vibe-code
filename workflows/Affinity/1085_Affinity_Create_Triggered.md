  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to notify you when a new list is created in Affinity. It uses an Affinity Trigger node to listen for the "list.created" event. When a new list is detected, it can prompt further actions, such as sending notifications or updating databases.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to keep their CRM data updated. For example, when a new list is created in Affinity, they could automatically log this in a project management tool or notify team members, ensuring everyone is aware of new data sets.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Affinity account credentials.
3. Set the workflow to active to start listening for new list events.
4. Customize additional actions following the trigger, like sending an email or updating a database.
5. Test by creating a new list in Affinity to ensure the workflow triggers correctly.

### Practice
Create a test list in Affinity and observe how the workflow reacts. Try adding an action node, such as an email node, to send yourself a notification when a new list is created.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate CRM updates, improving data accuracy and team communication. This skill can increase your efficiency in managing customer relationships, potentially leading to more satisfied clients and increased business opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
