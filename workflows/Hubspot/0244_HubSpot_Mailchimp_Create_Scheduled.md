  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates the synchronization of contact information between Mailchimp and HubSpot daily at 7:00 AM. It checks for any changes in Mailchimp contacts since the last execution, updates the corresponding contacts in HubSpot, and then records the current execution time for future runs.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their Mailchimp subscriber list is always up to date with their HubSpot CRM, maintaining accurate contact data for marketing and sales efforts.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Connect your Mailchimp and HubSpot accounts.
  3. Schedule the workflow to run daily.
  4. Customize the Mailchimp list ID and HubSpot contact fields as needed.
  5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates contacts correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a test Mailchimp list with a few contacts. Run the workflow and check if the contacts are updated in HubSpot. Modify some contact details in Mailchimp and rerun the workflow to see the changes reflected in HubSpot.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer seamless data synchronization services to clients, ensuring their marketing and sales platforms are aligned. This can enhance their operational efficiency and increase your value as a service provider, potentially leading to additional business opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** hubspotAppToken, mailchimpApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
