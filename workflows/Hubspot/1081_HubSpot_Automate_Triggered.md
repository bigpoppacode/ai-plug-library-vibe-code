  ### Explain
This n8n workflow uses a HubSpot Trigger to start a process whenever a specific event occurs in HubSpot, such as a new contact being added. It listens for changes or new entries in HubSpot and can be set to perform further actions, like updating other systems or sending notifications, based on these events.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update their CRM or send a welcome email whenever a new lead is added to HubSpot, ensuring timely follow-up and maintaining customer engagement without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your HubSpot account using the provided API credentials.
3. Configure additional fields like `maxConcurrentRequests` as needed.
4. Set the workflow to trigger on specific HubSpot events.
5. Test the workflow by adding a new contact in HubSpot.

### Practice
Set up a test HubSpot account, create a few contacts, and observe how the workflow triggers. Modify the trigger conditions to see how different events affect the automation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate lead management, ensuring no potential customer falls through the cracks. This can enhance customer satisfaction and increase sales, providing a competitive edge and potential upsell opportunities in your automation services.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
