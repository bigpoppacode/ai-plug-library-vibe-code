# Datetime Schedule Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **On schedule** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **X days into the future** `dateTime` — operation: **addToDate**
4. **Get Outlook Calendar events** `httpRequest` — url: `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendarview`
5. **Split out items** `itemLists` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "value"
6. **Try get database page** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**, operation: **getAll**
7. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", joinMode: "enrichInput1"
8. **If database page not found** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
9. **Create database page** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**
10. **Update database page** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**, operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of syncing Outlook Calendar events with a Notion database. It triggers on a schedule, retrieves upcoming events from Outlook, checks if they exist in Notion, and updates or creates a database entry accordingly. This ensures your Notion database is always up-to-date with your calendar events.

### Demonstrate
A consultant or business owner might use this workflow to ensure their team's Notion workspace is consistently updated with the latest calendar events, allowing for better planning and collaboration across projects.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Outlook and Notion accounts.
3. Set the schedule trigger to your desired frequency.
4. Customize the Notion database fields to match your setup.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates or creates entries as expected.

### Practice
Create a few test events in your Outlook Calendar, then run the workflow. Check your Notion database to see if the events are correctly updated or added. Adjust any fields as necessary to fit your specific needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your productivity by automating calendar management, freeing up time to focus on strategic tasks. Offering this as a service can attract clients looking for seamless integration solutions, boosting your income potential in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, oAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
