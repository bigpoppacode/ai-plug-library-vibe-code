# Datetime Webhook Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

18. **WordPress - Get All Posts** `wordpress` — operation: **getAll**
19. **Date & Time - Substract** `dateTime` — operation: **subtractFromDate**

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of adding AI-generated summaries to WordPress posts. It retrieves posts from WordPress, processes them with OpenAI to generate summaries, and updates the posts with these summaries. The workflow logs the updates in Google Sheets and notifies a Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A content manager could use this workflow to streamline content updates by automatically adding summaries to blog posts, saving time on manual summarization and improving SEO by enhancing post metadata.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect WordPress, OpenAI, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.
3. Set your WordPress domain in the workflow.
4. Customize the OpenAI prompt for your content type.
5. Test and activate the workflow to automate summaries.

### Practice
Create a test WordPress site and publish a few sample posts. Run the workflow to see how it generates and inserts summaries. Check Google Sheets for logs and Slack for notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated content management services, enhancing SEO and saving clients time. This can lead to new business opportunities and increased revenue in your AI automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, httpHeaderAuth, wordpressApi, googleApi, slackOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
