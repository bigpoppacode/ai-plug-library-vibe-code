# Toggl Create Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using togglTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Toggl**.
2. **Toggl** `togglTrigger` — pollTimes: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automatically fetch new time entries from Toggl. Toggl is a time-tracking tool, and this workflow uses a trigger node to periodically check for new entries. When new time entries are detected, they can be processed or used to update other systems, ensuring that time tracking data is always up-to-date.

### Demonstrate
A freelancer could use this workflow to automatically pull their time entries from Toggl every day. This data can then be used to generate daily reports or update billing systems, ensuring accurate invoicing and time management without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Toggl account using your API credentials.
3. Set the trigger to check for new entries at your preferred interval.
4. Customize the workflow to process time entries, such as logging them into a spreadsheet or sending a summary email.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and processes new entries correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Toggl project and log some time entries. Run the workflow to see how it detects and processes these entries. Experiment with different polling intervals to see how it affects the workflow's responsiveness.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate time management tasks, reducing administrative work and increasing efficiency. For consultants or freelancers, this can mean more accurate billing and less time spent on manual data entry, leading to higher productivity and client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** togglApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
