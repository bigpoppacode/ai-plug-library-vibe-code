## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading RSS feeds from multiple sources every 10 minutes, filtering new content, and categorizing it based on content type. It sends relevant updates to different Telegram channels for IT, Security, and Microsoft 365 topics. It ensures only new RSS items trigger notifications by storing previously seen items.

### Demonstrate
A tech news aggregator could use this workflow to automatically keep their audience updated with the latest articles from various RSS feeds, ensuring timely and categorized information delivery to different interest groups via Telegram channels.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Telegram account.
3. Customize RSS feed URLs in the "RSS Source" node.
4. Set the Telegram chat IDs in the respective nodes.
5. Test by running the workflow manually to check the flow and notifications.

### Practice
Create a test Telegram channel and modify the workflow to connect to it. Add a few sample RSS feeds and observe how the workflow fetches, filters, and notifies the channel with new articles. Adjust the filtering conditions to test different categorizations.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
