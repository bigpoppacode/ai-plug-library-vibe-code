## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the process of fetching and processing RSS feed data from The Verge. It runs every 5 minutes, retrieves the latest RSS entries, filters out entries already processed in previous runs, and extracts images from new entries. This ensures you only process and act on new content, keeping your data fresh and relevant.

### Demonstrate
A blogger could use this workflow to automatically gather the latest tech news articles from The Verge, ensuring they always have fresh content ideas and can quickly share new articles with their audience.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Cron node to trigger every 5 minutes.
3. Configure the RSS Feed Read node with your desired RSS feed URL.
4. Customize the Filter RSS Data node to capture the data you need.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it only processes new RSS entries.

### Practice
Create a simple test RSS feed with a few entries. Run the workflow and observe how it processes only the new entries. Modify the feed by adding new entries and re-run the workflow to see how it updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate content curation, saving time and ensuring you always have the latest information. This skill can attract customers looking for efficient content management solutions, opening doors for freelance work or enhancing your AI automation business offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
