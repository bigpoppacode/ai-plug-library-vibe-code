# Whatsapp Stickynote Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **WhatsApp Trigger**.
2. **list_links** `toolHttpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://lemolex.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/list-links`
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **WhatsApp Trigger** `whatsAppTrigger` — updates: "messages"
5. **get_page** `toolHttpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://lemolex.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/get_text`
6. **Postgres Users Memory** `memoryPostgresChat` — tableName: "message_history", sessionKey: "={{ $json.contacts[0].wa_id }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "1460", content: "[redacted]"
8. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.messages[0].text.body }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
9. **24-hour window check** `code` — jsCode: "// within24h?  – run once per item
// Meta (WhatsApp) timestamp arrives as seconds since epoch
const lastTs = Number($('WhatsApp Trigger').first().json.messages[0].timestamp) * 100…[truncated]"
10. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **cleanAnswer** `code` — jsCode: "// cleanAnswer – run once per item
let txt = $('AI Agent').first().json.output || '';

// 1. Remove bold / italic / strike markers
txt = txt.replace(/[*_~]+/g, '');

// 2. Convert …[truncated]"
12. **Send Pre-approved Template Message to Reopen the Conversation** `whatsApp` — template: "hello_world|en_US", phoneNumberId: "679436108574898", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
13. **Send AI Agent's Answer** `whatsApp` — operation: **send**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This n8n workflow automates customer support via WhatsApp by leveraging an AI agent to respond to customer inquiries. It uses WhatsApp to trigger the workflow when a message is received, retrieves relevant website data using HTTP requests, processes the information with an AI model to generate a response, checks if the conversation is within a 24-hour window, and sends the AI-generated answer back to the customer on WhatsApp. If the conversation is outside this window, a template message is sent to reopen the conversation.

**Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support on WhatsApp, ensuring customers receive quick, accurate responses to their inquiries without needing a human agent to respond manually.

**Imitate**: To adapt this workflow, connect your WhatsApp and OpenAI accounts in n8n. Customize the AI agent's prompt to match your business needs. Use your website URL in the HTTP request nodes. Test the workflow by sending a message to your WhatsApp number and observing the AI-generated response.

**Practice**: Create a test WhatsApp group and connect it to this workflow. Send various queries to test how well the AI agent responds. Adjust the AI prompt and HTTP requests to fine-tune the accuracy and relevance of the responses.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing automated customer support solutions. It helps reduce response times and improve customer satisfaction, making your business more attractive to potential clients looking for efficient, AI-driven support systems.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, whatsAppTriggerApi, whatsAppApi, postgres.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
