# Jiratool Schedule Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o-mini`

4. **OpenAI Chat Model3** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o-mini`
5. **OpenAI Chat Model4** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o-mini`
6. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Structured Output Parser** `outputParserStructured` — schemaType: "manual", inputSchema: "{

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of managing unresolved JIRA issues. It identifies long-lived issues, retrieves their details and comments, and uses AI to classify the issue state and sentiment. If a solution is found in the knowledge base, it updates the issue; if not, it sends reminders or escalates the issue, ensuring efficient resolution and customer satisfaction.
- **Demonstrate:** A support team in a software company can use this workflow to automatically manage and resolve old JIRA tickets, ensuring no issue is left unattended and improving customer satisfaction by providing timely updates and solutions.
- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your JIRA, OpenAI, and Slack accounts. 3. Customize the JIRA queries and Slack notifications to match your needs. 4. Test the workflow with sample issues to ensure it performs as expected.
- **Practice:** Create a test JIRA project with unresolved issues, then run the workflow. Observe how it classifies issues, sends updates, or escalates them. Modify issue comments to see how the workflow reacts to sentiment changes.
- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer advanced support automation services, reducing time spent on manual issue management, improving team efficiency, and increasing customer satisfaction, thereby boosting your service offerings and income potential in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, jiraSoftwareCloudApi, slackApi, notionApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
