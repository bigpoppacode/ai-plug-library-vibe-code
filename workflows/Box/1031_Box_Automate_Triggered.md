# Box Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using boxTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Box Trigger**.
  2. **Box Trigger** `boxTrigger` — events: "FOLDER.MOVED,FOLDER.DOWNLOADED", targetId: "118847708963", targetType: "file"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow is triggered by specific events in a Box account. It listens for when a folder is moved or downloaded, specifically targeting a file with the ID "118847708963". Essentially, it automates actions in response to changes in your Box storage, ensuring you stay updated on file movements or downloads.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor critical document changes in Box. For instance, if a contract file is downloaded or moved, they can get instant notifications, ensuring they always know where important documents are and who is accessing them.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Box account credentials.
3. Set the targetId to match the file you want to monitor.
4. Define actions to take when the trigger fires (e.g., send an email).
5. Activate the workflow to start monitoring.

**Practice**  
Create a test file in your Box account and use the workflow to monitor it. Move or download the file to trigger the workflow and verify if it responds as expected. Adjust settings to handle different scenarios.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer document monitoring and management services, which can be crucial for compliance and security. This adds value to your automation offerings, attracting clients who need to track document access and movement efficiently.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** boxOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
