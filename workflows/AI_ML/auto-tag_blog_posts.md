  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Auto-tag Blog Posts", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/auto-tag-blog-posts`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "auto-tag_blog_posts"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "auto-tag_blog_posts"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.

13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of tagging blog posts using AI. It starts with a webhook that receives blog post data. The text is split into manageable chunks and embedded into a vector format. These embeddings are stored in a Supabase vector database. The workflow queries this database to find relevant tags using AI, which are then appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping. If any errors occur, a Slack alert is triggered to notify the team.

**Demonstrate:**  
A content marketing agency might use this workflow to automatically tag blog posts for SEO optimization, ensuring that each post is easily discoverable and categorized correctly, saving time and improving consistency.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the webhook to receive blog post data.
3. Connect your Supabase and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Configure the AI model for tagging.
5. Test the workflow with sample blog post data to ensure it tags and records correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a sample blog post dataset and run the workflow. Observe how the text is split, embedded, and tagged. Adjust the AI model's parameters and see how it affects the tagging accuracy.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings, allowing you to provide automated content tagging solutions. This can attract new clients looking to improve their content SEO, leading to potential revenue growth in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
