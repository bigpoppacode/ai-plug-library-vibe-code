# Customer Sentiment Analysis
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Customer Sentiment Analysis", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/customer-sentiment-analysis`
4. **Pinecone Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
5. **Pinecone Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `embed-english-v3.0`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to analyze customer sentiment. It begins by receiving customer data via a webhook. The text is split into manageable parts and converted into vector embeddings using Cohere. These vectors are stored in Pinecone, a vector database, for future reference. The stored data is queried to provide context for the AI model, which analyzes the sentiment. The results are appended to a Google Sheet, and any errors are reported via Slack alerts.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to continuously monitor customer feedback from their website. By automating sentiment analysis, they quickly identify trends and address customer concerns, improving overall customer satisfaction and retention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive customer feedback.
3. Connect to Cohere for embeddings and Pinecone for vector storage.
4. Configure Slack and Google Sheets for notifications and data logging.
5. Test the workflow with sample feedback data to ensure it captures and processes sentiment accurately.

### Practice
Create a test feedback form and submit sample data. Observe how the workflow processes it, updates the sentiment analysis in Google Sheets, and triggers a Slack alert if an error occurs. Adjust any configurations as needed to optimize performance.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer sentiment analysis as a service, helping businesses understand customer emotions and improve their offerings. This capability can differentiate your services, attract new clients, and increase your income in the AI automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, pineconeApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
