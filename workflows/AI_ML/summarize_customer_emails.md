# Summarize Customer Emails
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Summarize Customer Emails", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/summarize-customer-emails`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "summarize_customer_emails"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "summarize_customer_emails"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `embed-english-v3.0`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow processes and summarizes customer emails automatically. It begins when an email is received via a webhook. The email content is split into manageable chunks and transformed into vector embeddings. These embeddings are stored in a Weaviate vector database and queried to provide context for a generative AI model. The AI model summarizes the email content and logs the summary into a Google Sheet. If an error occurs, a Slack alert is sent.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically summarize incoming customer support emails, saving time on manual reading and allowing the team to quickly prioritize responses based on the summarized content.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Weaviate, Cohere, Anthropic, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.  
3. Set up the webhook URL in your email service to trigger this workflow.  
4. Map your email data fields to the workflow nodes.  
5. Test the workflow with sample email data.

**Practice:**  
Create a test email in your system, trigger the workflow, and check the Google Sheet for the summarized output. Modify the email content and observe how the summary changes. Test error handling by introducing intentional errors in the email format.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer email summarization services to businesses, enhancing their customer support efficiency. It can generate income by reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction, making your automation business more valuable.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
