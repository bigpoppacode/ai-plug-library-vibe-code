# Image Captioning
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Image Captioning", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/image-captioning`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "image_captioning"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "image_captioning"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow processes images for captioning. It starts by triggering on an image upload via a webhook. The image data is split into chunks, embedded into a vector format, and stored in a Weaviate database. The workflow uses a Chat Model and RAG Agent to generate image captions based on retrieved vector data. Results are logged in a Google Sheet, and any errors trigger an alert in Slack.

**Demonstrate:**  
A marketing team could use this workflow to automatically generate captions for product images, streamlining content creation and ensuring consistency across platforms.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the webhook trigger to receive image data.  
3. Connect your Weaviate, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.  
4. Configure the image processing and captioning nodes.  
5. Test with sample images to ensure captions are generated correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a small set of test images and run them through the workflow. Check the Google Sheet to see the captions and simulate an error to test the Slack alert functionality.

**WIIFM:**  
By mastering this workflow, you can offer automated image captioning services to clients, enhancing their content marketing capabilities. This skill can differentiate your service offerings, attract new customers, and create recurring revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
