# Googletasks Gmail Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Gmail Trigger** `gmailTrigger` — filters: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]", authentication: "serviceAccount"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "600", height: "280", content: "## 📦 📦 New Email → Create Todo in Google Tasks
Create Todo in Google Tasks whenever receives new email with "To Do" label."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "600", height: "200", content: "## Required Setup:
Make sure the Gmail label "To-Do" exists. (You can create it manually in Gmail settings if it doesn't.)

Connect your Gmail and Google Tasks accounts via OAuth2 …[truncated]"
5. **Google Tasks** `googleTasks` — title: "={{$json["subject"]}}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically creates a new task in Google Tasks whenever you receive an email in Gmail labeled "To Do." It uses a Gmail trigger to detect new emails with this label and then sends the email's subject and snippet as a new task to Google Tasks, setting the due date to the next day.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure that any important emails marked with "To Do" are not forgotten and are automatically added to their task list, helping them manage priorities efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Create a "To Do" label in Gmail.
2. Connect Gmail and Google Tasks accounts in n8n.
3. Set up the Gmail trigger to look for "To Do" labeled emails.
4. Configure Google Tasks to create tasks with email subjects and snippets.
5. Test the workflow by sending an email with the "To Do" label.

### Practice
Create a test email account and send a few emails to yourself with the "To Do" label. Run the workflow and check if tasks are created in Google Tasks with the correct information.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline task management, ensuring critical tasks are tracked automatically. This efficiency can enhance productivity, making your automation services more appealing to clients, leading to potential business growth and increased income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleApi, googleTasksOAuth2Api.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
