# Googletasks HTTP Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1080", height: "660"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1020", height: "660"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "500", height: "660"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "500", height: "440"
6. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "340", content: "![Tutorial](https://www.samirsaci.com/content/images/2025/04/temp-9.png)

8. **Extract Yesterday Records** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/en/search?sessionDay.allDays=false&sessionDay.day={{$now.minus(18,'days').format('yyyyMMdd')}}&sessionDay.type=ALL`
9. **Extract HTML Blocks** `html` — operation: **extractHtmlContent**
10. **Parse Blocks** `html` — operation: **extractHtmlContent**
11. **Edit Links** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of extracting legislative procedures from a European Parliament website, filtering them for sustainability relevance using AI, and storing the results in a Google Sheet. It starts by scraping the website for records scheduled for debate, extracts relevant HTML content, and uses an AI agent to classify the sustainability relevance of each procedure. Relevant records are then logged in a Google Sheet and tasks are created in Google Tasks for further review.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to efficiently track sustainability-related legislative discussions for a client in the environmental sector, providing timely updates and actionable insights without manual data collection.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up API credentials for OpenAI, Google Sheets, and Google Tasks.
3. Adjust the scraping URL and CSS selectors if needed.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and processes data correctly.
5. Schedule the workflow to run at desired intervals.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet and Google Task account, then run the workflow with a test URL. Observe how the AI classifies sustainability-related content and logs it. Adjust the AI prompt to fine-tune classification accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer high-value automation services, like real-time legislative tracking, to clients. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new customers, and increase revenue by automating complex data extraction and analysis tasks.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
