# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, graphql.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: GraphQL (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data retrieval from a GraphQL API. It starts with a manual trigger and fetches data about past SpaceX launches, including mission names and launch details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze launch data for presentations, saving time on manual research and ensuring up-to-date information on SpaceX activities.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Manual Trigger node.
3. Add a GraphQL node with a query for your desired data.
4. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see results.

### Practice
Try modifying the GraphQL query to fetch different data (e.g., upcoming launches) and run the workflow. Observe how the output changes based on your query adjustments.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enhances your automation skills, allowing you to provide valuable insights to clients quickly, potentially increasing your service offerings and income through efficient data analysis.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "GraphQL" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
