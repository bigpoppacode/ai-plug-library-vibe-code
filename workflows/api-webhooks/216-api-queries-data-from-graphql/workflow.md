# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving graphql, function, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **GraphQL** node.
2. **Step 1: GraphQL (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the retrieval of country information based on a country code. It starts with a webhook that triggers the process, retrieves data via a GraphQL API, processes that data, and then formats it for output.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically fetch and respond with country details (like name and phone code) when a customer submits a form with their country code, enhancing customer support efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Webhook** node to receive country code input.
3. Connect a **GraphQL** node to query country details using the input from the webhook.
4. Add a **Function** node to process the GraphQL response.
5. Finally, use a **Set** node to format the output for users.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new country code and test it by sending a request through the webhook. Observe how the output changes based on different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to create automated solutions for clients, saving them time and improving service quality, which can lead to new business opportunities and increased income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "GraphQL" and "Webhook" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
