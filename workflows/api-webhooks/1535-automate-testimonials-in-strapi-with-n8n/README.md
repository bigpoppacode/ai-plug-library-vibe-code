# 1535 Automate Testimonials In Strapi With N8N

This workflow automatically collects and analyzes tweets related to Strapi and n8n.io, filters out retweets and old tweets, and stores the relevant tweets along with their sentiment analysis in a Strapi content management system.

Example: A marketing team for a Strapi-based website could use this workflow to continuously monitor social media for mentions of their product and related topics, and automatically store positive tweets in their website's content management system for use in marketing campaigns.

## What You Can Do
- Automatically searches Twitter for relevant tweets and filters out retweets and old tweets
- Analyzes the sentiment of each tweet using Google Cloud Natural Language API
- Stores positive tweets in a Strapi content management system for easy access and use
- Can be triggered by a webhook, allowing users to manually submit content for analysis and storage

2. Configure your settings

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
