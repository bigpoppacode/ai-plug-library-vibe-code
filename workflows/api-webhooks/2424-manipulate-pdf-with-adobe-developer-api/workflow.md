# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, executeWorkflowTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Create Asset (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Adobe API Query (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Load a test pdf file (dropbox)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Query + File (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Query + File + Asset information (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Process Query (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Wait 5 second (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Try to download the result (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Switch (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Forward response to origin workflow (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Authenticartion (get token) (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Upload PDF File (asset) (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of uploading a PDF file to Adobe's API, extracting data, and handling the response. It streamlines tasks like authentication, file processing, and downloading results, making it easier to manage PDF-related workflows without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the extraction of data from customer invoices in PDF format. Instead of manually processing each invoice, the owner can set up this workflow to upload invoices, extract relevant data, and store it in a database or spreadsheet automatically, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install n8n on your server or use the cloud version.
2. **Create a New Workflow**: Start with a Manual Trigger node.
3. **Add HTTP Request Node**: Configure it for Adobe API to create an asset.
4. **Add Dropbox Node**: Use it to load your test PDF file.
5. **Merge Data**: Use Merge nodes to combine the extracted data.
6. **Add Wait and Download Logic**: Implement wait times and download requests.
7. **Handle Responses**: Use Switch nodes to manage different outcomes.
8. **Test the Workflow**: Execute the workflow and check the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by using a different PDF file or changing the extraction parameters. Observe how it affects the output. Document any errors or unexpected results to understand the workflow's limitations and capabilities better.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients needing efficient document processing. You can save businesses time and resources, making you more attractive as a consultant or service provider, ultimately leading to higher revenue opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Upload PDF File (asset)" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
