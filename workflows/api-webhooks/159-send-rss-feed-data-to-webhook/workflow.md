# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, cron, rssFeedRead.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: RSS Feed Read (rssFeedRead)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: SplitInBatches1 (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: End1 (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: IF1 (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Merge1 (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: IF realtors or real estate (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: IF restaurant(s) (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: MongoDB: Find Article (mongoDb)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: MongoDB: Find Article1 (mongoDb)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: MongoDB: Insert (mongoDb)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: MongoDB: Insert1 (mongoDb)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Webhook (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Webhook1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading an RSS feed, categorizing the articles, and storing relevant data in a MongoDB database based on specific conditions (like real estate or restaurant-related content) before sending notifications via webhooks.

### Demonstrate
A real estate agency could use this workflow to automatically gather and store new property listings from an RSS feed. This saves time, ensures they never miss new listings, and allows them to respond quickly to potential clients.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger or cron job in n8n.
2. Use the RSS Feed Read node to pull data from your desired feed.
3. Add split nodes to process articles individually.
4. Use conditional nodes to filter articles based on keywords.
5. Insert relevant articles into a MongoDB collection.
6. Configure webhook nodes to notify your team or system of new entries.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that reads from an RSS feed of your choice, filters articles by a keyword (like "technology"), and logs the relevant titles to a Google Sheet. This will help you understand data flow and filtering.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can automate information gathering for your business or clients, ensuring timely updates without manual effort. This increases efficiency, enhances service offerings, and can lead to more clients seeking your automation expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Webhook1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
