# 1748 Pulling Data From Services That N8N Doesnt Have A Pre Built Integration For

This workflow demonstrates various use cases of the HTTP Request node, including data scraping, splitting response data into items, and handling pagination.

Example: A user might use this workflow to fetch a list of their starred GitHub repositories, extract the titles of recent blog posts, and split a JSON response into individual items for further processing.

## What You Can Do
- Data Scraping: The workflow fetches a random Wikipedia page and extracts the article title using the HTML Extract node.
- Splitting Response Data: The workflow takes the response body from an HTTP Request and splits it into individual items using the Item Lists node.
- Handling Pagination: The workflow demonstrates how to loop through paginated data from the GitHub API, incrementing the page number after each request.

## Quick Start
1. Import this workflow to n8n
2. Configure your settings
3. Start automating!

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
