# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Item Lists - Create Items from Body (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: HTML Extract - Extract Article Title (htmlExtract)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Item Lists - Fetch Body (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: If - Are we finished? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Set - Increment Page (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: HTTP Request - Get Mock Albums (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: HTTP Request - Get Wikipedia Page (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: HTTP Request - Get my Stars (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates tasks by connecting various nodes to perform actions like fetching data from APIs, processing that data, and sending notifications. It starts when a user manually triggers the workflow and sequentially executes steps like setting values, making HTTP requests, and extracting information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate the retrieval of customer feedback from GitHub stars, analyze it, and send summaries to their team. This saves time and ensures consistent monitoring of customer sentiment.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a 'Manual Trigger' node.
3. Use 'Set' to define variables, e.g., GitHub username.
4. Add 'HTTP Request' nodes to fetch data from GitHub.
5. Use 'If' nodes to check conditions and control the flow.
6. Execute the workflow to see results.

### Practice
Set up a similar workflow that retrieves your latest tweets using an HTTP request to the Twitter API. Process the data and send a summary to your email. Experiment with different conditions and outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients seeking efficiency, allowing you to offer valuable automation services and generate income as a consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTTP Request - Get my Stars" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
