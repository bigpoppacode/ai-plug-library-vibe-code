## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **@Get Issue** node.
2. **Step 1: @Get Issue (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Discord (discord)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking GitHub notifications every minute, processes any new notifications, and sends a summary to a Discord channel if there are any updates.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate GitHub notifications for their development team, ensuring they are promptly informed about issues or updates without manual checks, thus improving response times.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron** node to trigger every minute.
3. Use the **Function** node to get the current time and format it.
4. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch GitHub notifications using the formatted time.
5. Use another **Function** node to format the notifications.
6. Add an **IF** node to check if there are any notifications.
7. Connect to a **Discord** node to send a message if there are updates.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to check for notifications every 5 minutes instead of every minute and see how it affects the frequency of messages sent to Discord.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services, creating time-saving solutions for clients, enhancing their productivity, and potentially generating income through client retainers or project fees.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "@Get Issue" and "@Get Date 1 min ago" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
