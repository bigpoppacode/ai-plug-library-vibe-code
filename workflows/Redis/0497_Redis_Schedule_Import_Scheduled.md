# Redis Schedule Import Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×7, redis×4, executeWorkflow.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "433", height: "300"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "222", height: "281"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "205.18296892980436", height: "280", content: "## Set Interval
Define how frequently the main workflow should run."
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "445", height: "382"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "218", height: "281", content: "## Set Workflow ID
Set the ID of the main workflow which should be executed
"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "222", height: "281"
10. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "222", height: "281"
11. **Get Status** `redis` — operation: **get**
12. **Reset to Idle** `redis` — operation: **set**
13. **Redis Key exists** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **Continue if Idle** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
15. **No Operation** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
16. **Set Running** `redis` — operation: **set**
17. **Execute Workflow** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "4cnnwIeC9Sr5ngGZ"
18. **Set Idle** `redis` — operation: **set**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to manage the execution of another workflow at regular intervals. It uses a Redis database to track the status of the workflow (idle or running) to ensure that multiple instances don't run simultaneously. The process starts with a schedule trigger, checks the workflow status in Redis, and proceeds to execute the main workflow if it's idle. After execution, it resets the status to idle.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to automate a data processing task that should only run once at a time, such as daily report generation, to prevent data inconsistency or duplication.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Redis credentials in n8n.
3. Define the schedule for triggering the workflow.
4. Set the workflow ID to the one you wish to execute.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it only runs once at a time.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that logs a message to a file. Use this workflow to execute it every minute, ensuring only one instance runs at a time. Observe how the Redis status prevents multiple executions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer reliable automation services, ensuring tasks run without overlap. This can enhance your credibility, attract more clients, and increase revenue by providing dependable automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** redis.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
