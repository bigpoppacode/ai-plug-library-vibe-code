  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow checks if a domain is potentially hosting a Steam phishing site. It receives a domain via a webhook, checks if it has valid nameservers, and specifically if it's using Cloudflare. If confirmed, it sends emails to notify both Cloudflare and Steam about the phishing site.

- **Demonstrate:** A cybersecurity consultant could use this workflow to automate the detection of phishing sites targeting Steam users. This helps in quickly alerting the relevant parties to take action, thereby protecting users and maintaining trust.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into your n8n instance. Set up a webhook to receive domain queries. Configure Mailgun with your email credentials. Test the workflow by sending a sample domain through the webhook to see how it processes and sends notifications.

- **Practice:** Create a list of test domains in a CSV file. Use the workflow to process each domain, check for phishing indicators, and send notifications. Verify the email notifications are correctly formatted and sent to the right recipients.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated phishing detection services, enhancing cybersecurity measures for clients. This can lead to increased trust, client retention, and new business opportunities in cybersecurity consulting.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth, mailgunApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
