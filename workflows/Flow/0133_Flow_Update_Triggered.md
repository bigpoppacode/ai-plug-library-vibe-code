# Flow Update Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using flowTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Flow Trigger**.
  2. **Flow Trigger** `flowTrigger` — resource: **task**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to receive updates for specified tasks from a task management platform called Flow. It uses a "Flow Trigger" node to listen for changes or updates to tasks and initiates actions based on these updates. This allows users to automate responses or follow-up actions when tasks are updated, ensuring efficient task management and communication within a team.

**Demonstrate:**  
A project manager can use this workflow to automatically update a team Slack channel whenever a task's status changes in Flow, ensuring the team is always informed of progress without manual updates.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Flow account to n8n.
3. Define which task updates should trigger the workflow.
4. Set up additional nodes (e.g., Slack notification) for actions following the trigger.
5. Test the workflow with a sample task update.

**Practice:**  
Create a test task in Flow and update its status. Run the workflow to see how it captures the update and triggers a predefined action, like sending an email or a Slack message. Adjust the workflow to fit different task criteria.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline task management processes, saving time and improving team communication. Offering such automation solutions can increase your value to clients, leading to new business opportunities and income streams in automation consulting.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
