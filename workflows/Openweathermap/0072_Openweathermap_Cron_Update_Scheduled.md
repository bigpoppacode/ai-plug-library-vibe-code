# OpenWeatherMap Cron Update Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using cron, openWeatherMap, gotify.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Gotify**.
2. **Gotify** `gotify` — message: "=Hey! The temperature outside is {{$node["OpenWeatherMap"].json["main"]["temp"]}}°C.", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically sends a daily weather update via Gotify. It triggers at 9 AM every day, retrieves the current temperature in Berlin using the OpenWeatherMap API, and sends a message through Gotify with the temperature details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to keep their team informed about daily weather conditions, helping them plan outdoor activities or travel arrangements efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up and connect your OpenWeatherMap and Gotify accounts.
3. Adjust the trigger time in the Cron node if needed.
4. Customize the city in the OpenWeatherMap node.
5. Test to ensure messages are sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a workflow that sends a weather update for your current location. Test it by adjusting the city in the OpenWeatherMap node and observe the Gotify notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated notification services to clients, adding value by keeping them informed and improving decision-making. This can enhance your service offerings and increase client satisfaction, leading to potential income growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openWeatherMapApi, gotifyApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
