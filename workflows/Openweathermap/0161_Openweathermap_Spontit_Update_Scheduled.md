# OpenWeatherMap Spontit Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using cron, openWeatherMap, spontit.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Spontit**.
  2. **Spontit** `spontit` — content: "=Hey! The temperature outside is {{$node["OpenWeatherMap"].json["main"]["temp"]}}°C.", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends a daily weather update via a push notification using Spontit. It triggers every day at 9 AM, retrieves the current temperature for Berlin from OpenWeatherMap, and then sends a push notification with the temperature details to users through Spontit.

### Demonstrate
A local business owner could use this workflow to keep their customers informed about the daily weather, encouraging them to visit their store with weather-specific promotions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenWeatherMap and Spontit accounts.
3. Set the city in the OpenWeatherMap node to your desired location.
4. Test the workflow to ensure the notification sends correctly.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow for a different city, such as New York, and modify the notification message to include additional weather details like humidity or wind speed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer personalized weather updates to clients, increasing engagement and providing value-added services. It can be a stepping stone to creating more complex automations that drive customer interaction and business growth.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openWeatherMapApi, spontitApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
