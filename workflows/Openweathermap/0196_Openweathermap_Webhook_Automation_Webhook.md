  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves weather information for a specified city. It uses a webhook to receive a city name, queries the OpenWeatherMap API for the current weather data of that city, and then extracts and sets the temperature and weather description as output.

### Demonstrate
A travel agency might use this workflow to provide real-time weather updates to clients planning trips, ensuring they are well-informed about current conditions in their destination city.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenWeatherMap API key.
3. Set up a webhook to receive the city name as a query parameter.
4. Test the workflow by triggering the webhook with a sample city name.
5. Ensure the output displays the weather data correctly.

### Practice
Create a webhook URL and test it by entering a city name as a query parameter in your browser. Check if the workflow retrieves and displays the correct weather information, then modify the city name to see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer custom weather information services to clients, enhancing customer experience and opening opportunities for recurring revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openWeatherMapApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
