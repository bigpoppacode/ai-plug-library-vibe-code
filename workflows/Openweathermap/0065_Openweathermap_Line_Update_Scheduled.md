# OpenWeatherMap Line Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using line, cron, openWeatherMap.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **OpenWeatherMap**.
  2. **OpenWeatherMap** `openWeatherMap` — cityName: "berlin"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending a daily weather update via the Line messaging app. It uses a Cron node to trigger the workflow every day at 9 AM. The workflow then retrieves the current temperature in Berlin from the OpenWeatherMap API and sends this information to a Line user, ensuring they receive timely weather updates.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner in Berlin might use this workflow to send daily weather updates to employees, helping them plan their day better and prepare for any weather-related disruptions.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your OpenWeatherMap and Line accounts.  
3. Set the city in OpenWeatherMap to your desired location.  
4. Activate the workflow.  
5. Test by manually triggering the workflow to ensure the Line message is sent correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test workflow that sends a weather update for your city to your email daily. This will help you understand how to adapt the workflow to different messaging services or notification methods.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer weather-based automation services to clients, enhancing their operational efficiency. It can be a stepping stone to creating more complex automation solutions that can attract new customers and generate income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** lineNotifyOAuth2Api, openWeatherMapApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
