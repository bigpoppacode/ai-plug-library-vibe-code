# OpenWeatherMap Twilio Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using cron, openWeatherMap, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **NoOp**.
  2. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow checks the weather in Berlin using OpenWeatherMap and sends a text message via Twilio if the "feels like" temperature is below 18°C. It runs on a schedule set by the Cron node. If the condition is not met, the NoOp node is executed, doing nothing.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner can use this workflow to alert staff to wear appropriate clothing based on weather conditions, ensuring comfort and preparedness.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n. Connect your OpenWeatherMap and Twilio accounts. Set the Cron node for your desired schedule. Customize the city in the OpenWeatherMap node and the phone numbers in the Twilio node. Test the workflow to ensure it sends messages correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a similar workflow for your city. Adjust the temperature threshold and message content. Test it by changing the weather data manually to see how the workflow reacts.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer weather-based notification services, adding value to businesses that rely on weather conditions. This can attract clients in outdoor events, logistics, and travel, boosting your automation business income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openWeatherMapApi, twilioApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
