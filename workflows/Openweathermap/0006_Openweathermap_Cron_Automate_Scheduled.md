  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends a daily SMS at 9 AM with the current temperature in Berlin. It uses a Cron node to trigger the workflow, which retrieves the temperature from OpenWeatherMap and sends the information via Plivo SMS.

### Demonstrate
A travel agency could use this workflow to send daily weather updates to clients before their trips, helping them plan their day and pack appropriately.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n workflow.
2. Add a Cron node set to trigger at 9 AM.
3. Connect an OpenWeatherMap node with your API key to get Berlin's weather.
4. Add a Plivo node with your credentials to send SMS.
5. Test the workflow by executing it manually.

### Practice
Create a test workflow to send yourself a daily SMS with the weather in your city. Change the city name in the OpenWeatherMap node and test the SMS delivery using Plivo.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer personalized weather updates as a service, enhancing customer engagement for businesses like travel agencies or event planners, potentially increasing client satisfaction and retention.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** plivoApi, openWeatherMapApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
