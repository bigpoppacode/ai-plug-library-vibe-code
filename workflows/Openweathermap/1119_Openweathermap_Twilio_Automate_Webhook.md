  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Twilio**.
  2. **Twilio** `twilio` — to: "={{$node["Webhook"].json["body"]["number"]}}", message: "=The weather in {{$json["name"]}}, {{$json["sys"]["country"]}} is {{$json["main"]["temp"]}} ℃ with {{$json["weather"][0]["description"]}}. Humidity is {{$json["main"]["humidity"]}}…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending weather updates via SMS. It starts by receiving a webhook with a phone number and city name. The workflow stores this data in Airtable, retrieves the current weather for the specified city from OpenWeatherMap, and sends a detailed weather report via SMS using Twilio.

### Demonstrate
A travel agency could use this workflow to provide customers with real-time weather updates for their travel destinations. By sending a simple request with their phone number and city, customers receive instant weather updates via SMS, enhancing their travel planning experience.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive phone numbers and cities.
3. Connect Airtable, OpenWeatherMap, and Twilio with your credentials.
4. Test the workflow by sending a webhook request with your phone number and city.
5. Verify that you receive an SMS with the weather update.

### Practice
Create a test webhook that sends your phone number and a city name. Run the workflow and check if you receive an SMS with the correct weather details. Modify the city name and test again to see how the workflow handles different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated weather updates as a service. This can be a valuable add-on for travel agencies, event planners, or any business needing timely weather information. It provides a unique service, enhancing customer satisfaction and offering potential new revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, airtableApi, openWeatherMapApi, twilioApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
