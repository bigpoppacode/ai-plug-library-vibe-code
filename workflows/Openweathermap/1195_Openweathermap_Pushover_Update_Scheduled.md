# OpenWeatherMap Pushover Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using pushover, cron, openWeatherMap.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **OpenWeatherMap**.
  2. **OpenWeatherMap** `openWeatherMap` — cityName: "berlin"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow sends a daily weather update for Berlin at 9 AM via a push notification. It uses OpenWeatherMap to fetch the current temperature and delivers this information through Pushover.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to receive daily weather updates for planning outdoor events or logistics, ensuring weather conditions are always considered.

- **Imitate**: 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Connect your OpenWeatherMap and Pushover accounts.
  3. Set the city in the OpenWeatherMap node to your desired location.
  4. Customize the Pushover message if needed.
  5. Activate the workflow.

- **Practice**: Set up a test workflow using a different city in OpenWeatherMap and a different notification service (like email or Slack) to see how the workflow adapts and functions.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow enables you to offer customized weather update services to clients, enhancing operational planning and decision-making. This skill can expand your service offerings and generate additional income streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** pushoverApi, openWeatherMapApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
