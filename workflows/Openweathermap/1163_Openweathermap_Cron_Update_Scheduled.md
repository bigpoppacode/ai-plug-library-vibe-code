# OpenWeatherMap Cron Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using vonage, cron, openWeatherMap.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **OpenWeatherMap**.
  2. **OpenWeatherMap** `openWeatherMap` — cityName: "berlin"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends a daily weather update to a specified phone number. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current temperature in Berlin and sends this information via a Vonage SMS message. The workflow is scheduled to trigger every day at 9 AM using the Cron node.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to send daily weather updates to employees or customers, ensuring they are informed of the day's weather conditions, which can be particularly useful for outdoor events or logistics planning.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your OpenWeatherMap and Vonage accounts.
3. Set the phone number in the Vonage node parameters.
4. Activate the workflow to start receiving daily updates.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends the correct temperature information.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to send weather updates for a different city or at a different time. Modify the cityName parameter in the OpenWeatherMap node and adjust the Cron node to trigger at your desired time.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can offer automated weather update services to businesses, enhancing their operational efficiency and customer engagement. This skill can be monetized as part of a broader automation service offering, expanding your client base and income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** vonageApi, openWeatherMapApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
