# Readbinaryfile Spreadsheetfile Create
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Insert Rows1**.
  2. **Insert Rows1** `postgres` — table: `product`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of transferring data from an Excel spreadsheet into a PostgreSQL database. It reads a binary Excel file, processes it into a spreadsheet format, and then inserts specific columns (name and EAN) into the 'product' table of the PostgreSQL database. This helps in efficiently managing and updating product data without manual entry.

### Demonstrate
A retail business could use this workflow to regularly update their product database, ensuring that new or updated product information is accurately reflected in their system, thus maintaining inventory accuracy and improving sales operations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your PostgreSQL credentials.
3. Place your spreadsheet file at the specified path.
4. Map the spreadsheet columns to the database fields.
5. Execute the workflow to test data insertion.

### Practice
Create a small Excel file with sample product data. Run the workflow to see how it updates the database. Modify the file and rerun to observe changes, ensuring data is correctly inserted and updated.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer data integration and automation services, helping businesses maintain accurate databases effortlessly. This can lead to increased efficiency, better data management, and potential revenue from automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
