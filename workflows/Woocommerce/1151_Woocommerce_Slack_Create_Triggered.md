# Woocommerce Slack Create Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Price over 100**.
2. **Price over 100** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates notifications for new WooCommerce orders over $100. It triggers when an order is created, checks if the order total is $100 or more, and if so, sends a detailed notification to a Slack channel. This ensures timely updates on significant sales.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to instantly inform their sales team on Slack about high-value orders, ensuring quick follow-up and improved customer service.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect WooCommerce and Slack accounts.
3. Set the WooCommerce trigger for new orders.
4. Configure the Slack node to send messages to your desired channel.
5. Test with an order over $100.

### Practice
Create a test WooCommerce order over $100. Run the workflow to see how the order triggers a Slack notification. Adjust the Slack message format to include more order details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated sales alerts to clients, enhancing their order management efficiency. This can boost your service offerings, attract new customers, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** wooCommerceApi, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
