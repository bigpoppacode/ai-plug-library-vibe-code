# Googlebigquery Stickynote Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, lmChatOpenAi, agent.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Trigger Executed by the AI Tool**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "200", height: "520"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "700", height: "740"
5. **Call Query Tool** `toolWorkflow` — name: "bigquery_tool", workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "=Use this tool to run an SQL query and fetch the result from the BigQuery database.

The tool expects input in the following format:
{
  "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `transport.s…[truncated]"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "760", height: "460", content: "### 3. Big Query Workflow
Execute the SQL query generated by the AI agent in Big Query. Retrieve the results and send them back to the AI Agent.

### How to set up?

7. **Trigger Executed by the AI Tool** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
8. **Chat Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
9. **Chat with the User** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
10. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "780", height: "540", content: "### 4. Do you need more details?

11. **Sanitising the Query** `code` — jsCode: "return [
  {
    json: {
      query: $input.first().json.query.replace(/```sql|```/g, "").trim()
    }
  }
];
"
12. **AI Control Tower Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
13. **Query Database** `googleBigQuery` — options: "[object Object]", sqlQuery: "={{ $json.query }}", projectId: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow enables users to interact with a chat model powered by OpenAI to run SQL queries on a BigQuery database. It sanitizes user inputs, executes queries, and retrieves data efficiently. Designed for supply chain analytics, it helps users get structured data insights without displaying raw SQL queries.

### Demonstrate
A supply chain manager can use this workflow to quickly analyze shipment data, identifying trends in delivery times and delays using pre-defined SQL queries, thereby optimizing logistics and improving operational efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI and Google BigQuery accounts.
3. Set up the chat interface to receive user queries.
4. Test the workflow by inputting a sample query to ensure it fetches the correct data.
5. Customize SQL queries to fit your specific data needs.

### Practice
Create a query to count delayed shipments in the past month using the workflow. Test by adjusting query parameters and observing how data retrieval changes. This will help reinforce your understanding of SQL query execution and data handling.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer clients advanced data analysis services, enhancing decision-making capabilities. This can lead to higher-value contracts, as businesses seek data-driven insights to improve their operations, making you an invaluable asset in AI and data automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
