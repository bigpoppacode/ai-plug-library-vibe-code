  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates the creation and sharing of event banners. It starts by capturing event details via an n8n form, uses AI to generate an image based on a prompt, uploads the image to Cloudinary, applies it to a Bannerbear template, and then posts the final banner to Discord.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner can use this workflow to quickly create and share promotional banners for upcoming events on social media, saving time on graphic design and manual posting.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up an n8n form to capture event details. 3. Configure OpenAI, Cloudinary, and Bannerbear with your credentials. 4. Customize the template in Bannerbear. 5. Connect your Discord account and test the workflow.

- **Practice:** Create a sample event using the form, and run the workflow to see the banner generated and posted on Discord. Experiment with different prompts and templates to see how they affect the final output.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated event promotion services, helping clients enhance their marketing efforts efficiently. It can lead to increased revenue opportunities by providing a scalable solution for content creation and distribution.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpQueryAuth, bannerbearApi, discordBotApi, openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
