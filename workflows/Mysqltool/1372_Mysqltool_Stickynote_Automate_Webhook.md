# Mysqltool Stickynote Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Chat Trigger**.
  2. **Chat Trigger** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "Olá 👋
Sou Jovelino, o serviço de IA do Joov, me mande sua pergunta e responderei em seguida! :)"
3. **Postgres Chat Memory** `memoryPostgresChat` — tableName: "aimessages", sessionKey: "={{ $('Chat Trigger').item.json.session_id }}{{ $json.sessionId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
4. **Postgres Chat Memory1** `memoryPostgresChat` — tableName: "aimessages", sessionKey: "={{ $('Chat Trigger').item.json.session_id }}{{ $json.sessionId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
5. **Products in Daatabase** `mySqlTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
6. **Knowledge Base** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://quotation.joov.com.br/widget/info?modalidade={modalidade}&estado=SP&cidade={city}&operadora={operadora}`
7. **External API** `toolHttpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://integracao-sed-alb-323570099.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/findByNameAndBirthDate`
8. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "436.73182569600795", height: "367.7413881276459"
9. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **Edit Fields1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **assistant**
12. **Edit Fields2** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **OpenAI2** `openAi` — resource: **assistant**, prompt: "define"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This workflow is designed to manage chat interactions by storing and retrieving chat history using a PostgreSQL database. It triggers a chat session that interacts with users and stores the conversation. The workflow utilizes OpenAI's assistant for processing inputs and generating responses. It also queries a MySQL database to fetch product information and interacts with an external API for additional data processing.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support by providing instant responses to customer queries, storing chat history for future reference, and retrieving relevant product information from a database.

- **Imitate**: 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up your PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. 3. Connect your OpenAI API. 4. Customize the chat trigger and database queries to align with your business needs. 5. Test the workflow to ensure seamless operation.

- **Practice**: Create a test chat session and interact with the AI. Check how chat history is stored in PostgreSQL and how product queries are executed. Modify the workflow to handle different types of customer queries and observe the results.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer advanced AI-driven customer support solutions, enhancing customer satisfaction and streamlining operations. It opens opportunities for creating value-added services and generating income by automating customer interactions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres, mySql.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
