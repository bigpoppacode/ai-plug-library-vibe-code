# Mysqltool Stickynote Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Chat Trigger**.
  2. **Chat Trigger** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "Olá 👋
Sou Jovelino, o serviço de IA do Joov, me mande sua pergunta e responderei em seguida! :)"
3. **Postgres Chat Memory** `memoryPostgresChat` — tableName: "aimessages", sessionKey: "={{ $('Chat Trigger').item.json.session_id }}{{ $json.sessionId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
4. **Postgres Chat Memory1** `memoryPostgresChat` — tableName: "aimessages", sessionKey: "={{ $('Chat Trigger').item.json.session_id }}{{ $json.sessionId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
5. **Products in Daatabase** `mySqlTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
6. **Knowledge Base** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://quotation.joov.com.br/widget/info?modalidade={modalidade}&estado=SP&cidade={city}&operadora={operadora}`
7. **External API** `toolHttpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://integracao-sed-alb-323570099.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/findByNameAndBirthDate`
8. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "436.73182569600795", height: "367.7413881276459"
9. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **Edit Fields1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **assistant**
12. **Edit Fields2** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **OpenAI2** `openAi` — resource: **assistant**, prompt: "define"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow acts as a chatbot named Jovelino, which interacts with users, records conversations, and accesses external databases and APIs to provide information. It starts with a chat trigger, stores chat history in a Postgres database, queries a MySQL database for product information, and uses external APIs to fetch additional data. The workflow uses conditions to determine the flow of conversation and generates responses using OpenAI.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer service on their website, providing instant answers to common questions and accessing databases for detailed responses, thus saving time and improving customer satisfaction.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your Postgres, MySQL, and OpenAI accounts. 3. Set up a chat trigger on your website. 4. Customize the database queries and API calls to fit your business needs. 5. Test the workflow to ensure it responds accurately and updates records correctly.

**Practice:** Create a simple chatbot workflow that greets users and saves their name and question to a database. Test it by simulating a user interaction and checking the database for correct entries.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can enable you to offer chatbot solutions to businesses, enhancing customer interaction and data management. This can expand your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase your income in the growing field of AI automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres, mySql.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
