# Automate
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Function**.
  2. **Function** `function` — functionCode: "return items[0].json.map(item => {
  return {
    json: {
      data:item
    },
  }
});
"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow processes a list of items using a two-step function sequence. Initially, it generates mock data with four items. The second function node iterates through these items, wrapping each in an object with a `data` property. This setup is useful for data transformation tasks where inputs need to be reformatted or prepared for further processing.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to transform data from a raw format into a structured format before inserting it into a database, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of errors during data handling.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Review the mock data generation code to understand the format.
3. Adjust the transformation function to match your desired output structure.
4. Test the workflow to ensure each item is correctly wrapped in a `data` property.

### Practice
Create a new set of mock data with different item values. Modify the function to include additional properties or alter the structure, then observe how these changes affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to efficiently handle data transformations, a critical skill in automation projects. It can enhance your service offerings, enabling you to tackle complex data integration tasks and attract clients seeking streamlined data processing solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
