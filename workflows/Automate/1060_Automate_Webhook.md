# Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **Calculator** `toolCalculator` — configured for its default action.
3. **Chat OpenAI** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
5. **Get Products** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://n8n.io/webhook/get-products`
6. **Order Product** `toolHttpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://n8n.io/webhook/order-product`
7. **Get Order** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://n8n.io/webhook/get-orders`
8. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "Hellooo! 👋 My name is Pizzaro 🍕. I'm here to help with your pizza order. How can I assist you?

📣 INFO: If you’d like to order a pizza, please include your name + pizza type + q…[truncated]"
9. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.chatInput }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to automate pizza orders via a chatbot named Pizzaro. When a customer sends a message to the chatbot, it processes the request using an AI agent. The workflow retrieves product information, processes orders, and checks order status. It uses OpenAI to understand customer requests and responds accordingly, ensuring a smooth interaction for ordering pizzas.

**Demonstrate:**  
A pizzeria could use this workflow to handle online orders, reducing the need for manual order-taking. It ensures customers can place orders anytime, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI account.
3. Set up the webhooks for product retrieval, ordering, and order status.
4. Customize the chatbot messages to fit your business.
5. Test the workflow by simulating customer interactions.

**Practice:**  
Create a test scenario where a customer orders a specific pizza type and quantity. Run the workflow to see how it responds and processes the order. Adjust the chatbot's responses for clarity and efficiency.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated ordering systems to businesses, enhancing their customer service operations. This can lead to new clients and additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
