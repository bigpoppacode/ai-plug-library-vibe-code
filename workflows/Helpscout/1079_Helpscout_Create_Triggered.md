# HelpScout Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using helpScoutTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HelpScout Trigger**.
  2. **HelpScout Trigger** `helpScoutTrigger` — events: "customer.created"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to automatically notify or trigger actions when a new customer is created in HelpScout. It uses a HelpScout Trigger node that listens for the "customer.created" event. When this event occurs, the workflow can proceed with further actions, such as sending notifications, updating a CRM, or logging the event for future reference.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their sales team is immediately informed about new customer sign-ups, allowing for prompt follow-up and personalized customer service, thus enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your HelpScout account in the HelpScout Trigger node.
3. Set the workflow to listen for the "customer.created" event.
4. Add additional nodes to perform actions like sending emails or updating databases.
5. Activate the workflow and test it by creating a new customer in HelpScout.

**Practice:**  
Create a test customer in HelpScout and observe if the workflow triggers. Add a node to send a Slack message and confirm the notification appears in your Slack channel. Experiment with adding different actions to see how the workflow can be expanded.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate customer onboarding processes, reducing manual tasks and improving response times. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase revenue in your AI automation business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
