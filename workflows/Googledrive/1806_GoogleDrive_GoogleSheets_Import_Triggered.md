  2. **Wikipedia** `toolWikipedia` — configured for its default action.
3. **Calculator** `toolCalculator` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "260", content: "## Get Latest File
"
5. **Google Drive ** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "260", height: "260"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "440", height: "380"
8. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "300", height: "280"
9. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "800", height: "80"
10. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1280", content: "## Description

13. **Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing new document files in Google Drive. When a new document is added to a specified folder, the workflow retrieves its content and uses an AI model to summarize the document. The summary, along with metadata like the document's name and upload date, is then stored in a Google Sheet. This process ensures efficient handling and easy access to summarized document information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep a concise record of all meeting notes or project updates uploaded to Google Drive, ensuring quick access to essential information without reading through lengthy documents.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Google Drive, Google Docs, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up a Google Drive trigger to monitor a specific folder.
4. Test the workflow by uploading a document to the folder and verifying that the summary appears in Google Sheets.

### Practice
Create a test Google Drive folder and upload different types of documents. Run the workflow to see how well it summarizes various content. Adjust the AI model or summarization prompts as needed to improve accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer document management solutions to clients, helping them streamline information handling and enhance productivity. This skill can differentiate your services and generate additional income in an AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDocsOAuth2Api, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, googleDriveOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
