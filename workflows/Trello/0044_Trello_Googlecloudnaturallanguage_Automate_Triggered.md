## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the analysis of customer feedback collected via Typeform. It uses Google Cloud Natural Language to assess sentiment and then processes the feedback based on the sentiment score. If the feedback is positive, it is logged in Notion and shared on Slack. Regardless of sentiment, a Trello card is created with the feedback details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently manage customer feedback. By automating sentiment analysis, they can quickly identify positive feedback to share with the team and track all feedback in Trello for further action.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Typeform, Google Cloud, Notion, Slack, and Trello to your accounts.
3. Set up the Typeform form and Google Cloud Natural Language API.
4. Configure Notion, Slack, and Trello nodes with your own databases and channels.
5. Test the workflow to ensure feedback is processed correctly.

### Practice
Create a Typeform survey with a feedback question. Run the workflow by submitting feedback, observe how it gets analyzed, and verify if it updates Notion, sends a Slack message, and creates a Trello card as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated sentiment analysis services, enhancing customer engagement strategies for businesses. This skill can attract clients looking to leverage AI for better understanding and managing customer feedback, leading to increased business opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, googleCloudNaturalLanguageOAuth2Api, notionApi, slackApi, trelloApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
