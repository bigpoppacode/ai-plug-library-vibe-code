# Trello GoogleCalendar Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using function, set, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Trigger Every Day at 8am**.
2. **Trigger Every Day at 8am** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the creation of Trello cards based on daily events from a Google Calendar. It triggers every day at 8 AM, retrieves events for the day, filters out recurring tasks like "Lunch" or "Check email," and creates Trello cards for the remaining events. This helps in organizing daily tasks efficiently in Trello.

**Demonstrate:**  
A project manager could use this workflow to automatically convert daily meetings and tasks from their Google Calendar into Trello cards, ensuring that their project board is always up-to-date without manual entry.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Calendar and Trello accounts.
3. Set up your calendar details and Trello board details.
4. Customize the list of recurring tasks to exclude as per your needs.
5. Activate the workflow to run daily.

**Practice:**  
Set up a test Google Calendar with sample events. Run the workflow and check if the Trello board accurately reflects the day's non-recurring events. Adjust the list of recurring tasks and rerun to see the changes.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can streamline task management, saving time and reducing errors. It offers a valuable service to clients needing efficient task tracking, potentially enhancing your automation business's service portfolio and increasing client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api, trelloApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
