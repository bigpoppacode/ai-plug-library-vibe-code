# Trello Limit Automate Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "500", height: "620"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "640", height: "360"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "500", height: "1120"
6. **RSS Read Testing Catalog** `rssFeedRead` — url: `https://www.testingcatalog.com/rss/`
7. **RSS Read marktechpost** `rssFeedRead` — url: `https://www.marktechpost.com/feed/`
8. **RSS Read** `rssFeedRead` — url: `https://www.artificial-intelligence.blog/ai-news?format=rss`
9. **Merge** `merge` — numberInputs: "3"
10. **Transform date** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Filter by date (more than 7 days)** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **Sort by date** `sort` — options: "[object Object]", sortFieldsUi: "[object Object]"
13. **Limit news to x** `limit` — maxItems: "10"
14. **Transform new to MD** `code` — jsCode: "// Loop over input items and add a new field called 'myNewField' to the JSON of each one
let ret = ""
for (const item of $input.all()) {
  ret = ret + '- [' + item.json.title + '](…[truncated]"
15. **Publish comment** `trello` — resource: **cardComment**
16. **Send revision email** `gmail` — sendTo: "thomas@pollup.net", message: "The Trello comment for https://trello.com/c/dFtYLRXv has been update. 
Please check.", options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of aggregating and distributing news from multiple RSS feeds. It pulls data from three different RSS sources, filters the articles to show only those published in the last seven days, sorts them by date, and limits the list to the ten most recent articles. These articles are then converted into a Markdown format and posted as a comment on a Trello card. An email notification is sent to a specified recipient to review the Trello comment.

**Demonstrate:**  
A content manager could use this workflow to keep their team updated with the latest industry news by automatically posting a weekly news summary to a Trello board, ensuring everyone has access to relevant and timely information.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect and configure your RSS feeds in the RSS Read nodes.
3. Set up Trello and Gmail with your credentials.
4. Adjust the schedule in the Schedule Trigger node.
5. Test the workflow to confirm it posts and emails correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Trello board and add a few RSS URLs. Run the workflow and observe how it processes and posts news updates. Modify the RSS feeds or date filters to see how the output changes.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated news aggregation services, enhancing your value to clients by keeping them informed of industry trends. This can boost client retention and open opportunities for upselling additional automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** trelloApi, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
