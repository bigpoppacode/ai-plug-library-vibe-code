# Github Manual Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, set×3, github×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Note** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "389.78906250000017", height: "464.79920462713443"
4. **Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "861.4145066375679", height: "478.9952882299376"
5. **Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "260.44696745223945", height: "196.65095879641083"
6. **Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "344.0461264465236", height: "237.66186698228626"
7. **Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "378.7476641422645", height: "182.45487519360773"
8. **Globals** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
9. **n8n - get all workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]"
10. **GitHub - get all files** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **list**
11. **Set n8n existing workflows names** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Merge globals and files** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "multiplex"
13. **GitHub - get each file** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **get**
14. **Set name and content** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Merge Github and n8n workflows - Keep only non existing workflows based on the name** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", joinMode: "keepNonMatches"
16. **If workflow already exists** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
17. **n8n - create workflow** `n8n` — operation: **create**
18. **Workflow name already exists** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the restoration of workflows from a GitHub backup to an n8n instance. It compares existing workflows in n8n with those stored in a specified GitHub repository. If a workflow in the GitHub repository does not exist in n8n, it is created in n8n, ensuring you have the latest versions without duplicates.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer could use this workflow to restore workflows from a GitHub backup after a system crash, ensuring that the n8n instance is up-to-date with the latest versions stored in the backup.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.  
2. Set up GitHub credentials and adjust the repository details in the "Globals" node.  
3. Run the workflow manually to test.  
4. Observe workflows being restored from GitHub to n8n if they do not already exist.

**Practice**  
Create a test repository on GitHub with a few workflow JSON files. Run the workflow to restore these into n8n. Modify a workflow in GitHub and re-run the workflow to ensure only non-existing workflows are added.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer backup and restoration services to clients, ensuring their automations are safely stored and easily recoverable. This can enhance your service portfolio and provide a reliable solution for business continuity, potentially increasing your income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi, n8nApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
