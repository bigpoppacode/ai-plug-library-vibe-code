# Github Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using githubTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Github Trigger**.
  2. **Github Trigger** `githubTrigger` — owner: "n8n-io", events: "*", repository: "n8n-docs"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow uses a GitHub Trigger to initiate a process whenever any event occurs in the "n8n-docs" repository owned by "n8n-io". It monitors all types of events, such as pushes, pull requests, and issues, and can be used to automate responses or actions based on these events. This setup is ideal for keeping track of repository changes and automating tasks like notifications, updates, or further integrations.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to automatically post a message in a Slack channel whenever a new issue is created in the "n8n-docs" repository. This ensures the team is immediately aware of new issues and can act on them promptly.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub account with the appropriate credentials.
3. Set up the GitHub Trigger node with your desired repository and events.
4. Add additional nodes to perform actions like sending notifications or updating a database.
5. Test the workflow by creating an event in the repository.

### Practice
Create a test repository on GitHub and set up the GitHub Trigger in n8n to monitor it. Add a node to send a Slack message on new issues. Create a test issue in the repository and observe how the workflow reacts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage and automate responses to GitHub events, enhancing your development operations. This skill can attract clients who need reliable automation for their development processes, offering you opportunities to expand your service offerings and increase revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
