# Github Cron Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using gitlab×2, github, cron.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **List issues**.
  2. **List issues** `gitlab` — resource: **repository**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of checking the latest GitHub release against existing GitLab issues. It runs weekly to get the latest release from a GitHub repository and lists existing issues in a GitLab repository. If there is no issue corresponding to the latest release's tag name, it creates a new issue in GitLab to track the release.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to ensure that every new release in their GitHub repository is tracked as an issue in their GitLab project, facilitating better release management and ensuring that no updates are missed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub and GitLab accounts.
3. Set up the Cron node to run weekly.
4. Ensure the Get latest release and List issues nodes point to your repositories.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it creates an issue when a new release is detected.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository and a corresponding GitLab project. Add a release to GitHub and run the workflow. Check if a new issue is created in GitLab with the release details, ensuring the workflow functions as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline release management processes, ensuring no updates are overlooked. This capability can be offered as a service to development teams, enhancing their operational efficiency and potentially increasing your revenue streams in an automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
