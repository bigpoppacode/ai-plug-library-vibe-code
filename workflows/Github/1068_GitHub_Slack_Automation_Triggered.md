# Github Slack Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Github Trigger**.
  2. **Github Trigger** `githubTrigger` — owner: "Mesdocteurs", events: "release", repository: "mda-admin-partner-api"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically notifies a Slack channel whenever a new release is published in a specific GitHub repository. It listens for "release" events in the "mda-admin-partner-api" repository owned by "Mesdocteurs." When a release is detected, it sends a message to the "extranet-md" Slack channel with details such as the release name, description, and a link to the release.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to keep all team members updated on the latest software releases, ensuring everyone is aware of new changes and features. This helps in maintaining transparency and quick access to release information.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub and Slack accounts in n8n.
3. Set the GitHub repository and Slack channel parameters.
4. Activate the workflow to start monitoring for new releases.
5. Test by creating a dummy release in the GitHub repository.

### Practice
Create a test repository on GitHub and set up a Slack workspace. Implement the workflow and simulate a release to see how the notification is sent to Slack. Adjust the message format to include additional details if needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance team communication and streamline software deployment processes. It enables you to offer automated release notifications as a service to development teams, improving their efficiency and potentially increasing your income by providing valuable automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, githubApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
