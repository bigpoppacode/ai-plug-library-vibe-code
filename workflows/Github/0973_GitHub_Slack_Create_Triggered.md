# Github Slack Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack - Remove**.
  2. **Slack - Remove** `slack` — channel/topic: `#general`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors a GitHub repository for star events. When a user stars or unstars the repository, it triggers a Slack notification. If a star is added, a message is sent to the #general Slack channel announcing the new star and displaying the current star count. If a star is removed, a different message is sent indicating the removal and showing the updated star count.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to keep track of their project's popularity. By monitoring star changes on GitHub, they can celebrate new stars in team meetings or investigate why stars might be decreasing.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub account to the GitHub Trigger node.
3. Connect your Slack account to the Slack nodes.
4. Customize the Slack messages and channel if needed.
5. Activate the workflow to start monitoring star changes.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository and star/unstar it using different accounts. Observe how the workflow responds by sending notifications to your Slack channel. Adjust the messages or conditions if needed to better suit your needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time monitoring services to clients, enhancing their project management and engagement strategies. By offering this as part of your automation services, you can attract developers seeking better project insights and potentially increase your income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
