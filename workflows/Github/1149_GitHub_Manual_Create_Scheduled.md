# Github Manual Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using github×3, noOp×3, function×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Globals**.
  2. **Globals** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup and synchronization of your n8n workflows to a GitHub repository. It retrieves workflows from n8n, checks for changes or new workflows, and updates the GitHub repository accordingly. This ensures that you have a version-controlled backup of your workflows, making it easy to track changes and restore previous versions if needed.

### Demonstrate
A developer working on multiple automation projects can use this workflow to ensure all their n8n workflows are backed up and version-controlled in GitHub. This keeps their workflows safe from accidental loss and makes collaboration easier.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub account.
3. Set up the `Globals` node with your GitHub repository details.
4. Schedule the workflow to run daily or trigger it manually.
5. Test to ensure workflows are correctly backed up to GitHub.

### Practice
Create a test repository in GitHub and run the workflow with a small set of n8n workflows. Verify that the workflows are being backed up and that changes are tracked in GitHub. Experiment with modifying a workflow to see how the system records changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow offers you a reliable method to manage your n8n workflows, ensuring version control and data safety. This skill can be valuable for offering workflow backup solutions to clients, enhancing your service offerings, and generating additional income in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
