# Github Aggregate Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, toolWorkflow×3, set×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When Executed by Another Workflow**.
  2. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "680", height: "660"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "560", height: "300"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "380", height: "100"
6. **Github MCP Server** `mcpTrigger` — path: `/61848df7-3619-4ccf-831b-d6408e0d6519`
7. **Get Latest Issues** `toolWorkflow` — name: "getLatestIssues", workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "Retrieves the latest issues from the github respository."
8. **Add Issue Comment** `toolWorkflow` — name: "addIssueComment", workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "Call this tool to add a comment to the github issue."
9. **Get Issue Comments** `toolWorkflow` — name: "getIssueComments", workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "Retrieves the issue and associated comments and discussion"
10. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "1260", content: "## Try It Out!

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**
This n8n workflow manages GitHub repository issues. It can retrieve the latest issues, fetch comments on a specific issue, or add a comment to an issue. The workflow is triggered by another workflow and uses a series of nodes to perform operations on GitHub via API calls. It processes data to simplify and aggregate results for easier use.

**Demonstrate**
A developer might use this workflow to automate tracking and managing issues in their GitHub repositories, ensuring they are always up-to-date with the latest comments and can quickly respond to or update issues.

**Imitate**
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub account.
3. Set up a trigger from another workflow to initiate this one.
4. Customize the GitHub repository details in the nodes.
5. Test the workflow by executing it manually or through the triggering workflow.

**Practice**
Create a test GitHub repository. Use the workflow to automate adding comments to issues. Observe how the workflow retrieves and updates issue comments, ensuring it functions correctly.

**WIIFM**
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer GitHub issue management automation services to software teams, saving them time and improving their productivity. This can enhance your service portfolio and increase your income in an AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
