# Github Stickynote Update Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, githubTrigger, homeAssistant.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On any update in repository**.
  2. **On any update in repository** `githubTrigger` — owner: "dummydavid", events: "*", repository: "DemoRepo"
3. **Note** `stickyNote` — width: "378", height: "351", content: "## Turn on a light to a specific color on any update in GitHub repository
This workflow turns a light red when an update is made to a GitHub repository. By default, updates include…[truncated]"
4. **Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "315", height: "248", content: "### Configure light here

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically turns a light red using Home Assistant whenever there's an update (like a code push, pull request, or issue update) in a specified GitHub repository. It's designed to provide a visual alert for repository changes.

### Demonstrate
A development team could use this workflow to signal when code is pushed to a repository, enabling team members to notice updates instantly, making it useful for team collaboration and rapid response to code changes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub and Home Assistant accounts.
3. Set the GitHub trigger to monitor your desired repository.
4. Customize the light settings in Home Assistant for your environment.
5. Test the workflow by updating the GitHub repository to see the light change.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository and link it to a light in your Home Assistant setup. Make a change to the repository and observe how the light reacts. Experiment with different light colors or actions for different types of updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide innovative alert systems to clients, enhancing team communication and responsiveness. It helps you offer unique automation solutions, increasing your service value and potential income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi, homeAssistantApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
