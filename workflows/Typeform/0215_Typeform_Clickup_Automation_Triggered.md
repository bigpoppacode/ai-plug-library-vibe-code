# Typeform ClickUp Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using set×4, clickUp, typeformTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Pick List**.
2. **Pick List** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{$node["Typeform Trigger"].json["What type of a request are you making?"]}}", dataType: "string"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing user requests submitted through a Typeform form. It classifies the type of request (e.g., Document, Presentation, Update, or Workflow) using a Switch node. Based on the classification, it routes the request to the appropriate ClickUp list, where a task is created with details from the Typeform submission, including the request title, description, requester information, and priority.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to streamline task creation from client requests. It ensures tasks are automatically categorized and assigned to the correct project list in ClickUp, saving time and reducing manual data entry errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform and ClickUp accounts.
3. Configure the Typeform Trigger with your form ID.
4. Adjust the Switch node values to match your request types.
5. Test by submitting a Typeform entry and ensure tasks appear in ClickUp.

### Practice
Create a simple Typeform with different request types. Submit a few entries and observe how the workflow routes them to different ClickUp lists. Modify a request type and see how it affects the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient task management solutions to clients, enhancing productivity and organization. It can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and opportunities for upselling additional automation services in your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** clickUpOAuth2Api, typeformApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
