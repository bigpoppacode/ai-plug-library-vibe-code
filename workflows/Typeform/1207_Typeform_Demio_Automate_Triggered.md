## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the registration process for a Demio event. When someone fills out a Typeform, their details are captured and automatically used to register them for a Demio webinar. The process is seamless, ensuring that attendees are registered without manual input, saving time and reducing errors.

### Demonstrate
Imagine a business owner hosting a webinar on Demio. They use Typeform to collect sign-ups. This workflow auto-registers attendees in Demio, streamlining the process and ensuring no potential attendee is missed, thereby maximizing webinar attendance.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform and Demio accounts.
3. Customize the Typeform to capture user details like name and email.
4. Set the Demio Event ID.
5. Run a test to ensure attendees are registered automatically.

### Practice
Create a Typeform with fields for name and email. Connect it to the workflow and register for a test event on Demio. Check Demio to ensure the registration was successful. Modify the form and test again to see how changes are handled.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer seamless registration solutions for webinars, enhancing client marketing efforts. This can increase your service offerings, leading to more business opportunities and potential income in the automation sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
