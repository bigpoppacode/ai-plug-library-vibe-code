# Typeform Airtable Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Airtable**.
2. **Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **append**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting data from a Typeform submission and appending it to an Airtable database. When a Typeform form is submitted, the workflow triggers, capturing the form data and then adding a new record to a specified table in Airtable. This helps in organizing and storing form responses efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically collect and store customer inquiries submitted via a Typeform on their website into an Airtable database. This ensures all inquiries are logged and easily accessible for follow-up, improving customer service and data management.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform and Airtable accounts.
3. Set the Typeform Trigger with your specific form ID.
4. Configure the Airtable node with your table and application details.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a sample Typeform and ensure the data is appended to Airtable.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform with a few fields and link it to a test Airtable base. Run the workflow and submit the form to see how the data appears in Airtable. Try adding different data types to see how they are handled by the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient data collection and management solutions to clients. By automating data entry tasks, you can help businesses save time and reduce errors, potentially increasing your service offerings and revenue in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, airtableApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
