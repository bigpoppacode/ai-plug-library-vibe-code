# MQTT Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using mqttTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **MQTT Trigger**.
  2. **MQTT Trigger** `mqttTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to listen for messages from an MQTT queue. MQTT is a messaging protocol that enables lightweight, low-bandwidth communication between devices. When a message arrives in the specified MQTT topic, this workflow triggers, allowing you to process the message data further using additional nodes and logic within n8n.

### Demonstrate
A smart home developer could use this workflow to automate actions based on MQTT messages from IoT devices. For instance, when a temperature sensor publishes data to the MQTT topic, the workflow could trigger an alert if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your MQTT broker credentials.
3. Specify the MQTT topic you want to listen to.
4. Add additional nodes to process the message, such as sending an alert or updating a database.
5. Test the workflow by publishing a message to the MQTT topic.

### Practice
Set up a test MQTT broker and publish messages to a topic. Create a basic workflow in n8n that triggers on these messages and logs them to a file or sends an email notification. Experiment with different message payloads to see how the workflow handles them.

### WIIFM
Mastering MQTT workflows can help you tap into the growing IoT market, offering automation solutions for smart homes, industrial monitoring, and more. This expertise can attract new clients and expand your service offerings in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mqtt.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
