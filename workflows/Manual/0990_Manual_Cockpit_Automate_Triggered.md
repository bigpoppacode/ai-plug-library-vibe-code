  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to retrieve data from a Cockpit CMS collection called "samplecollection" when manually executed. It allows users to pull content or data stored in Cockpit CMS into the n8n environment for further processing or integration with other applications.

A content manager could use this workflow to extract and review content from their Cockpit CMS before publishing it on their website. This ensures that all content is accurate and up-to-date, streamlining the content management process.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Cockpit CMS credentials.
3. Set up the manual trigger to execute the workflow.
4. Specify the collection you want to retrieve data from in Cockpit CMS.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves the desired content.

### Practice
Create a test collection in Cockpit CMS with a few entries. Run the workflow to see how it retrieves the data. Modify the collection's content and re-run the workflow to observe how it updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your capabilities in managing content efficiently, allowing you to offer streamlined content management solutions to clients. This can lead to improved client satisfaction and potential upsells in your automation business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
