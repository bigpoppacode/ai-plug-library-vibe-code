# Manual Executecommand Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Start**.
  2. **Start** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Passing variables** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "{
  "voice": "af_sarah",
  "text": "Hello world!"
}
"
4. **Run python script** `executeCommand` — command: "=python C:\KOKORO\voicegen.py "{{ $json.text }}" "{{ $json.voice }}" 1
"
5. **Play sound** `readBinaryFiles` — fileSelector: "D:/output.mp3"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow converts text to speech by passing a text and voice selection to a Python script, which generates an audio file. The workflow starts manually, sets variables for the text and voice, executes the Python script to create the audio file, and then plays the sound from the generated file.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the creation of audio content for podcasts or virtual assistants, saving time and ensuring consistency in voice and message delivery.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Ensure the Python script is in the specified path with the correct parameters.
3. Set the text and voice variables in the workflow.
4. Run the workflow manually to test the text-to-speech conversion.

### Practice
Create a simple text-to-speech script and manually change the text variable in the workflow to see how different inputs affect the audio output. Experiment with different voices and text to understand the workflow's flexibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated audio content creation services, enhancing your service offerings and opening new revenue streams. It's a valuable skill in the growing field of AI-driven content automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
