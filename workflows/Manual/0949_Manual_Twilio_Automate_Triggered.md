  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to send an SMS message using Twilio whenever executed. It consists of two nodes: a manual trigger that starts the process when you click 'execute', and a Twilio node that sends the SMS based on predefined settings. This simple workflow automates the sending of text messages, making it easier to communicate with customers or clients without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner can use this workflow to send promotional SMS messages to customers. For example, they might send a special discount code to all customers who have opted into their SMS list, enhancing customer engagement and promoting sales.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Twilio account within the Twilio node.
3. Customize the SMS content and recipient details in the Twilio node.
4. Test the workflow by executing it manually to ensure the SMS sends correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Twilio account and set up a simple SMS message. Run the workflow to send the SMS to your phone number. Experiment with changing the message content and recipient number to see how the workflow handles different scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer SMS marketing services, enhancing communication strategies for businesses. This can lead to increased client engagement and potential upsell opportunities in your automation business, expanding your service offerings and generating additional income.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
