# Manual Noop Monitor Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×3, manualTrigger, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set Close Date To Original**.
  2. **Set Close Date To Original** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to manage and update a "Close Date" field. Initially, it sets a default close date. It then checks if a valid close date is already present. If a valid close date is found, it resets it to the original value. If not, it sets the close date to three weeks from the current date. This ensures that any record processed by the workflow has a consistent and updated close date.

- **Demonstrate:** A real estate agency might use this workflow to ensure all property listings have a valid contract close date. This helps agents keep track of deadlines and ensures that no property is left with an undefined closing timeline.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect it to your data source with a "Close Date" field. 3. Set the initial close date and the condition for checking validity. 4. Customize the workflow to update the date to your specific requirements. 5. Test the workflow with sample data.

- **Practice:** Create a test dataset with some records having a valid close date and some without. Run the workflow to observe how it updates the dates. Adjust the conditions and actions to see different outcomes.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to automate date management tasks, ensuring data consistency and accuracy. This skill can be a valuable asset for businesses that rely on timely updates, such as sales or project management, leading to improved efficiency and client satisfaction.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
