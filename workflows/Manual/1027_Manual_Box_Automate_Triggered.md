  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to interact with the Box platform. It starts with a manual trigger, meaning it runs when you manually execute it. The workflow then connects to your Box account to access or create a folder named "n8n-rocks". This can be used to organize files or data within your Box account.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to organize project files in Box. For example, after completing a project, they can execute this workflow to automatically create a new folder, ensuring all related documents are stored neatly in one place.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Box account credentials.
3. Manually trigger the workflow to create or access the "n8n-rocks" folder.
4. Customize the folder name or add more steps as needed for your specific use case.

### Practice
Create a trial Box account and set up the workflow to create a folder. Execute the workflow and verify the folder is created in your Box account. Modify folder names and re-run to see changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer organization and data management solutions to clients using Box. This can enhance your service offerings, attract clients needing cloud storage solutions, and increase your business's value proposition.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
