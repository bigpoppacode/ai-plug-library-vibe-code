# Manual Totp Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, totp.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **TOTP** `totp` — options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to generate Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) for secure authentication. It begins with a manual trigger that starts the workflow when you click 'Test workflow.' The TOTP node then generates a one-time password using the configuration set in the TOTP account. This process is useful for applications requiring an additional layer of security through two-factor authentication (2FA).

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to test the generation of TOTP codes for a new security feature in their application, ensuring that users can securely log in with 2FA without needing external TOTP apps.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger node.
3. Add a TOTP node and configure it with your TOTP account.
4. Click 'Execute Workflow' to generate and view TOTP codes.
5. Integrate the workflow into your application for secure logins.

### Practice
Create a test workflow in n8n with a manual trigger and TOTP node. Generate a TOTP code and verify its correctness by using it in a test application or service that supports TOTP-based 2FA.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer secure authentication solutions, enhancing your service offerings. This can attract businesses needing robust security measures, potentially increasing your marketability and revenue in the AI automation space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** totpApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
