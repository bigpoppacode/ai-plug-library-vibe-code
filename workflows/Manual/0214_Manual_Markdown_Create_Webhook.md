# Manual Markdown Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **GetTimesheetRecords**.
  2. **GetTimesheetRecords** `function` — functionCode: "return [{UserName: "User 1 - Lead Programmer",
         UserAvatar: "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?d=robohash&s=32",
         TaskTitle: "Admin",
         date: "2022-05-31T00:0…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a timesheet report. It starts by retrieving timesheet records, sorts them by user, task, and date, and fetches user avatars. The workflow compiles this data into a structured Markdown report, converts it to HTML, and prepares it to be sent via email as an attachment.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to automate the weekly creation and distribution of timesheet reports to stakeholders, saving time and ensuring consistent reporting.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect to your data source for timesheet records.
3. Adjust sorting fields and report formatting as needed.
4. Set up email credentials.
5. Test by executing the workflow and checking the generated report.

### Practice
Create a test set of timesheet records and run the workflow. Verify that the report is generated correctly and includes all necessary details. Modify the report style or content and observe the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated reporting services, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency for clients. This can enhance your service portfolio and open up opportunities for ongoing client engagements.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** smtp.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
