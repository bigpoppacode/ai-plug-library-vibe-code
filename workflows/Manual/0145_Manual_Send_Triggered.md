# Manual Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, function, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sample email**.
  2. **Sample email** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of domain names from email addresses. It starts with a manual trigger, then sets a sample email address. The workflow proceeds to extract the domain part of the email address using a function node, which isolates the text after the "@" symbol, providing a clean domain name output.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to quickly extract domain names from user email inputs on a website, helping to identify the organization or company associated with the email address for analytics or targeted marketing.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect a manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Set up the 'Sample email' node with desired email addresses.
4. Use the 'Extract domain name' function to parse the domain.
5. Run the workflow to see the domain extracted from the email.

### Practice
Create a simple n8n workflow using a set node with different email addresses. Execute the workflow and observe how the domain extraction function processes each email. Experiment by changing email addresses to see the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline data processing tasks, like organizing email lists by domain for targeted marketing. This skill enhances your ability to offer valuable services, potentially increasing client acquisition and revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
