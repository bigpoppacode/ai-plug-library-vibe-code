  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to create a new client in Harvest, a time tracking and invoicing tool. It starts with a manual trigger, which means you activate it by clicking a button in the n8n interface. Once executed, the workflow uses the Harvest node to add a new client to your Harvest account. This is useful for automating the process of client onboarding, ensuring that all new clients are consistently added to your system without manual data entry.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow when onboarding new clients. By automating the client creation process in Harvest, they save time and reduce errors associated with manual data entry, ensuring that all client projects can be tracked and billed accurately from the start.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Harvest account by providing the necessary API credentials.
3. Customize the client details within the Harvest node to match your needs.
4. Test the workflow by manually triggering it to ensure it adds a client to Harvest correctly.

### Practice
Create a test client in Harvest using this workflow. Use the manual trigger to execute the workflow and check if the client appears in your Harvest account. Adjust the client details and run the workflow again to see how changes are reflected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline client management, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in onboarding processes. This skill can be marketed to potential clients, offering them automated solutions that save time and reduce administrative overhead, thereby increasing your service offerings and potential income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
