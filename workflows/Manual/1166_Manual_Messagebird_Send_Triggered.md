  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to send SMS messages using the MessageBird service. It starts manually when you execute it, and then it uses the MessageBird node to send a text message to specified recipients. You configure the message content, sender details, and recipient phone numbers within the workflow.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to send out promotional SMS messages to a list of customers, informing them about a new product launch or a special discount. This helps in reaching a broad audience quickly and effectively.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Set up your MessageBird account credentials in n8n.
3. Define the message text, originator, and recipient numbers in the MessageBird node.
4. Execute the workflow manually to send the SMS.
5. Test with different messages and recipients to ensure it works as expected.

### Practice
Create a mock campaign where you draft an SMS message for a fictional sale event. Set up a test list of phone numbers and execute the workflow to see how the message is sent. Adjust the message and recipient details to explore different scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer SMS marketing services to businesses, enhancing customer engagement and driving sales. This skill can expand your service offerings and increase your income potential in the automation and AI business sector.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
