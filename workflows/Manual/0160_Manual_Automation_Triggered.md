# Manual Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set**.
  2. **Set** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sets specific values for number, string, and boolean variables using a Set node. When executed, it assigns the number 20, the string "From n8n with love", and the boolean value true to variables, which can then be used in subsequent workflow steps.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to initialize variables with default values at the start of an automation process. This is useful for setting constants or initial states that other parts of the workflow rely on.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the workflow manually.
3. Use the Set node to define number, string, and boolean values.
4. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the assigned values.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow with a Manual Trigger and a Set node. Assign values like a favorite number, a greeting message, and a true/false flag. Execute the workflow and observe the output in the debug panel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps in setting up foundational configurations for larger automation projects. It’s a stepping stone to building more complex workflows, enhancing your ability to deliver tailored automation solutions and increasing your value in the automation market.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
