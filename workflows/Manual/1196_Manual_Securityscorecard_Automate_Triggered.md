# Manual Securityscorecard Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using securityScorecard×3, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **SecurityScorecard2**.
  2. **SecurityScorecard2** `securityScorecard` — resource: **report**, operation: **download**, url: `={{$json["download_url"]}}`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating and downloading a security report from SecurityScorecard. It starts manually, generates a full security scorecard report for the domain "n8n.io," retrieves the report's download URL, and finally downloads the report. This ensures that you have the latest security insights about a domain.

### Demonstrate
A cybersecurity consultant could use this workflow to regularly obtain updated security reports for client domains, helping them identify vulnerabilities and improve their security posture without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your SecurityScorecard account.
3. Trigger the workflow manually to generate a report.
4. Follow the connections: generate the report, get the download URL, and download the report.
5. Adjust the domain and report type as necessary.

### Practice
Create a test workflow using a different domain. Trigger it manually and verify that the report is generated and downloaded correctly. Adjust settings to change the report type or domain for further experimentation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated security monitoring services to clients, enhancing their cybersecurity without extra manual work. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and recurring revenue opportunities in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** securityScorecardApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
