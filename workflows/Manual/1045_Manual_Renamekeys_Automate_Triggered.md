# Manual Renamekeys Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, set, renameKeys.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Rename Keys**.
  2. **Rename Keys** `renameKeys` — keys: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to change the name of a key in a data object. Initially, it sets a key-value pair, then renames the key from "key" to "newkey". This is useful for reformatting data to match specific requirements or standards before further processing.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow when integrating data from different systems that require specific key names, ensuring compatibility and preventing errors in data processing or API calls.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Use the Set node to define your initial key-value pair.
4. Configure the Rename Keys node to specify the current and new key names.
5. Execute the workflow to see the renamed key in action.

### Practice
Create a mock data object with multiple key-value pairs. Use the workflow to rename one or more keys, then verify the changes by inspecting the output. Experiment with different key names to understand the renaming process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to streamline data transformations, ensuring compatibility across systems. This skill enhances your ability to deliver seamless integrations, attracting clients seeking effective data solutions, and potentially increasing your income in the automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
