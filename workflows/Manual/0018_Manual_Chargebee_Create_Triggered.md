This n8n workflow is designed to manually create a new customer in Chargebee. It starts with a manual trigger node, which means the process is initiated when you click 'execute'. The workflow then uses the Chargebee node to create a customer record by entering the first and last name details in Chargebee's system. This helps manage customer data efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Chargebee account using API credentials.
3. Customize the Chargebee node to include customer details like first and last name.
4. Click 'execute' to test the workflow and create a customer in Chargebee.
5. Verify the new customer record in Chargebee.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
