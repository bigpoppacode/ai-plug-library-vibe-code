# Manual Postgres Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Postgres1**.
  2. **Postgres1** `postgres` — table: `test`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow creates a new table in a PostgreSQL database and inserts a record into it. It starts manually, creates a table called `test` with columns `id` and `name`, then sets values for these columns (with `name` defaulting to "n8n") before inserting the data into the table.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow when setting up a new project that requires initializing a database with default data, ensuring the database schema is ready and contains initial entries for testing or development purposes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect to your PostgreSQL database using valid credentials.
3. Adjust the `CREATE TABLE` query to fit your schema needs.
4. Set desired values in the "Set" node.
5. Execute the workflow to create the table and insert a record.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that initializes a different table in your database with custom columns and default values. Test by executing the workflow and verifying the table and data creation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate database setup and management, saving time during development and deployment. This skill can be offered as a service, enhancing your automation business by helping clients streamline their database operations.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
