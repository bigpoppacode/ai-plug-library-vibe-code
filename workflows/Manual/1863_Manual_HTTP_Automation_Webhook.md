# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:n3w-italia::AsVfsl7B`
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "556.5145228215765", height: "211.35269709543567", content: "# Step 2

Once the .jsonl file for training is uploaded (See the entire process here.: https://platform.openai.com/finetune/), a "new model" will be created and made available via …[truncated]"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "777.3941908713687", height: "265.161825726141", content: "[redacted]"
7. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
8. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
9. **Upload File** `openAi` — resource: **file**
10. **Create Fine-tuning Job** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fine-tuning an OpenAI model. It starts with a manual trigger or a chat message, downloads a training file from Google Drive, uploads it to OpenAI, and creates a fine-tuning job. This allows for customized AI models based on specific data, which can be used to enhance AI capabilities for specific tasks.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to create a specialized AI model for a client, such as a customer support chatbot tailored to their specific industry, by using proprietary training data stored in Google Drive.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Drive and OpenAI accounts.
3. Place your training data in Google Drive.
4. Set up the workflow to trigger manually or on receiving a chat message.
5. Test the workflow to ensure the fine-tuning job is created successfully.

### Practice
Create a small training dataset in JSONL format, upload it to Google Drive, and run the workflow to fine-tune a model. Check if the fine-tuned model meets your specific requirements by testing its responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer customized AI solutions to clients, enhancing your service offerings and potentially increasing income. It positions you as a skilled provider of tailored AI models, which can be a valuable asset in the growing AI automation market.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, openAiApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
