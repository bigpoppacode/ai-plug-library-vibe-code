# Manual GoogleSlides Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using googleSlides×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Slides1**.
  2. **Google Slides1** `googleSlides` — resource: **page**, operation: **getThumbnail**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves slides from a Google Slides presentation and generates thumbnails for each slide. It starts manually, fetches all the slides from a specified presentation, and then processes each slide to create a thumbnail image. This is useful for previewing slides without opening the full presentation.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to automate creating slide previews for clients, allowing them to quickly browse through presentation content. This can improve client engagement by making it easier to review and select slides for feedback or revision.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Slides account using OAuth2.
3. Set the presentation ID in the Google Slides node.
4. Trigger the workflow manually to test slide retrieval and thumbnail generation.
5. Adjust the presentation ID to match your own Google Slides.

### Practice
Create a Google Slides presentation with a few slides. Use this workflow to generate thumbnails and verify that each slide's thumbnail is accurately created and accessible. Experiment by adding new slides and running the workflow again.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated slide management services to clients, enhancing their ability to review and select presentation content efficiently. This capability can increase your value as a service provider, potentially leading to new client opportunities and income streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSlidesOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
