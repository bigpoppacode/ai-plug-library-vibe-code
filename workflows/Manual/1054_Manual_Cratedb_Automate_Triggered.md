# Manual CrateDB Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set**.
  2. **Set** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow creates a simple database table in CrateDB, inserts a predefined record, and then retrieves the data. It begins with a manual trigger that executes a SQL query to create a table named "test" with columns "id" and "name." It then sets a record with an id of 0 and name "n8n," inserts it into the table, and retrieves the stored data.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to quickly set up and test database operations in CrateDB, ensuring that data insertion and retrieval processes work as expected in a controlled environment.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your CrateDB credentials.
3. Trigger the workflow manually to execute the database creation and data insertion.
4. Customize the "Set" node to insert different values if needed.
5. Test the workflow to verify data retrieval from CrateDB.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to automate the creation of a different table in CrateDB, insert multiple records, and retrieve them. Adjust the "Set" node to handle a list of data, and observe how the workflow manages multiple inserts and retrievals.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate database management tasks, saving time on repetitive data operations. This skill can enhance your service offerings to clients, enabling you to manage data-driven applications efficiently, potentially increasing your income in the automation and data management spaces.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** crateDb.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
