# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, mindee, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*1T9GkAb93w5NSMsf`

  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to extract information from an image of a receipt. It begins with a manual trigger, which, when executed, sends an HTTP request to retrieve an image file from a specified URL. This image is then processed by the Mindee node, which analyzes the receipt and extracts relevant data such as total amount, date, and merchant details.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to automate the process of inputting receipt data into their accounting software. By extracting data from images of receipts automatically, they save time and reduce manual data entry errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Mindee account to the Mindee node.
3. Customize the HTTP Request URL to point to your receipt image.
4. Trigger the workflow manually to test the extraction process.
5. Adjust the workflow to store extracted data in your desired format or system.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by taking a picture of a receipt and hosting it at a URL. Use this URL in the HTTP Request node and run the workflow. Check the extracted data to ensure it matches the receipt details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data extraction services, saving businesses time and improving accuracy in financial record-keeping. This skill can enhance your service offerings and attract clients seeking efficient data management solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mindeeReceiptApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
