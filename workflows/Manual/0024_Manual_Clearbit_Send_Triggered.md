  ### Explain
This n8n workflow allows you to look up information about a person using their email address with the help of Clearbit. When executed, it triggers a manual process that sends the email address to Clearbit, which then returns detailed information about the person, such as their name, job title, and company. This workflow is useful for enriching contact data with valuable insights.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to enrich their contact database. For example, when they receive a new lead's email, they can quickly gather additional information like the lead's job title and company, helping them tailor their marketing or sales approach more effectively.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Clearbit account by entering your API key.
3. Set up the Manual Trigger node.
4. Enter a test email address in the Clearbit node to see the data it retrieves.
5. Execute the workflow and review the returned information.

### Practice
Create a list of test email addresses and run them through the workflow to see what data Clearbit returns. Adjust the workflow to handle different scenarios, such as missing data or errors in the response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer data enrichment services to clients, providing them with valuable insights about their leads or customers. This can enhance their marketing strategies and improve conversion rates, leading to increased revenue and client satisfaction.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
