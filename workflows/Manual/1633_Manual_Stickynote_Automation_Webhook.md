  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating shortened URLs using the Dub.co API. It starts with a manual trigger and uses API authentication to connect to Dub.co. The workflow then attempts to create a new shortened URL. If the slug (customizable part of the URL path) is available, it sets the shortened URL; if not, it retrieves an existing URL ID and updates it. The final shortened URL is stored in a designated field.

**Demonstrate**  
A marketing consultant could use this workflow to quickly generate branded, trackable short links for clients' campaigns, ensuring consistency and ease of sharing across social media and marketing materials.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up API Auth with your Dub.co credentials.  
3. Define the long URL and optional custom slug.  
4. Test the workflow to ensure it generates a shortened URL.  
5. Adapt the workflow for different projects by changing the project slug or domain.

**Practice**  
Create a test project in Dub.co and use the workflow to generate a short link. Experiment with different custom slugs and observe how the workflow handles unavailable slugs by retrieving and updating existing links.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer URL shortening as a service, enhancing marketing campaigns with branded links. This can attract clients needing efficient, trackable URLs, adding a valuable service to your AI automation business and increasing potential revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
