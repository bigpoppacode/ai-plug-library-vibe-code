# Manual Googletasks Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, googleTasks.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works

  2. **Google Tasks** `googleTasks` — task: "MDY3OTAyNjUyMDk5NDY5ODIzMzM6MDow", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to add a specific task to a Google Tasks list when manually triggered. It consists of two nodes: the first node is a manual trigger that starts the workflow when you click 'execute', and the second node interacts with Google Tasks to add a pre-defined task to your task list.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly add recurring administrative tasks to their Google Tasks list with a single click, ensuring that important tasks are not forgotten and are easily accessible for daily planning.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Google Tasks** node and connect it to the Manual Trigger.
4. Configure the Google Tasks node with your Google account and specify the task details.
5. Save and execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Create a new task in Google Tasks manually, then use the workflow to add another task. Compare both tasks in Google Tasks to ensure the workflow adds tasks correctly. Modify the task details in the workflow and observe the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to automate personal or team task management, saving time and reducing the chance of missing important tasks. This skill can be offered as a service to clients, opening up opportunities for income generation through automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleTasksOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
