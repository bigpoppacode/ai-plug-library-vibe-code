  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to create a task in ClickUp. It consists of two nodes: a manual trigger and a ClickUp node. When you manually execute the workflow, it triggers the creation of a new task in ClickUp. The task details, such as list, name, and team, are specified within the ClickUp node's parameters, although they appear empty in this example.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to quickly add tasks to ClickUp during a team meeting, ensuring that action items are documented in real-time and nothing gets overlooked.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your ClickUp account via the ClickUp API credentials.
3. Fill in the task details (list, name, team) in the ClickUp node.
4. Manually trigger the workflow to create a task in ClickUp.
5. Verify that the task appears in your ClickUp workspace.

### Practice
Create a mock project in ClickUp and use this workflow to add several tasks. Adjust task names and lists to see how changes in the workflow parameters affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate task creation in project management, enhancing productivity and organization. It can be a valuable offering for clients who need efficient task management solutions, boosting your automation business's appeal and profitability.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
