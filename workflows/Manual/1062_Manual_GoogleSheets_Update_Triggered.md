# Manual GoogleSheets Update Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set**.
  2. **Set** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates interactions with a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It appends new data, looks up and updates existing entries, and reads updated data. It starts by manually triggering the workflow, appending data with random ID, rent, and city details, and then looks up entries based on the city name. The rent value is updated by adding 100, and the updated data is read and displayed.

### Demonstrate
A real-world example for this workflow is a property management company updating rent details for properties. When new properties are added or existing ones need rent adjustment, this workflow ensures consistent updates across their records.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Google Sheets with columns: ID, Name, Rent, City.
3. Authenticate your Google account in n8n.
4. Customize the workflow by adjusting the city lookup and rent increase logic if needed.
5. Trigger the workflow manually to test updates.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with sample property data. Run the workflow and observe how it appends new entries and updates existing ones. Experiment by changing the city name and rent increment to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data management tasks, saving time and reducing errors in record-keeping. This skill can be a valuable service to offer clients, enhancing data accuracy and operational efficiency in businesses.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
