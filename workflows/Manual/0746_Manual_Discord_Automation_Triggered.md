# Manual Discord Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Discord**.
  2. **Discord** `discord` — text: "Hello World!", webhookUri: "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/XXX/XXX"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends a "Hello World!" message to a Discord channel using a webhook. It is triggered manually and consists of two nodes: a manual trigger and a Discord node. When executed, the workflow initiates the manual trigger, which then sends the message to the specified Discord webhook URL.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to test sending automated messages to a Discord channel. For instance, they could use it to notify team members of updates or alerts in a shared Discord channel.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Discord webhook for your channel.
3. Replace the placeholder webhookUri with your actual Discord webhook URL.
4. Click 'execute' on the manual trigger node to test the message delivery.

### Practice
Create a new Discord channel and set up a webhook. Use the workflow to send different test messages by modifying the text parameter. Observe how the messages appear in the Discord channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate notifications and alerts, enhancing communication within teams or communities. This skill can be valuable in an AI automation business to provide clients with efficient communication solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
