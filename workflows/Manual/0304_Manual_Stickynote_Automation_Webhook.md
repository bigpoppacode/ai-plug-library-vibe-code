# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using code×2, stickyNote×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "394", height: "304", content: "## Example data
These nodes simply download some example files to work with."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "304", height: "307", content: "## Transformation
This is where the magic happens. Multiple items with one binary object each are being transformed into one item with multiple binary objects."
5. **Set URLs** `code` — jsCode: "return [{
  json: {
    url: "https://static.thomasmartens.eu/n8n/file01.jpg"
  }
}, {
  json: {
    url: "https://static.thomasmartens.eu/n8n/file02.jpg"
  }
}, {
  json: {
    ur…[truncated]"
6. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.url }}`
7. **Merge items** `code` — jsCode: "let binaries = {}, binary_keys = [];

for (const [index, inputItem] of Object.entries($input.all())) {
  binaries[`data_${index}`] = inputItem.binary.data;
  binary_keys.push(`data…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to download a series of image files from specified URLs and merge them into a single item with multiple binary objects. It begins with a manual trigger, which initiates the workflow. It then sets the URLs of the images, downloads each image using HTTP requests, and finally merges the downloaded files into a single output, consolidating the binary data for further processing or storage.

### Demonstrate
A graphic design agency could use this workflow to automate the process of collecting image assets from various sources, merging them into a single package for batch processing or archiving, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the manual trigger for execution.
3. Configure the URLs for the images you want to download.
4. Ensure the HTTP Request node is set to download files.
5. Test the workflow to verify that the images are successfully merged.

### Practice
Create a test workflow with different image URLs. Run the workflow to see how it downloads and merges images. Experiment by adding more URLs or changing the file types to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated image processing services, increasing efficiency and accuracy in handling large volumes of media. This can attract clients in digital marketing, content creation, and more, enhancing your service offerings and revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
