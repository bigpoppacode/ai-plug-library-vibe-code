# Manual Strapi Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using strapi×3, set×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Strapi2**.
  2. **Strapi2** `strapi` — entryId: "={{$node["Strapi1"].json["id"]}}", contentType: "={{$node["Strapi"].parameter["contentType"]}}"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates content management in Strapi, a headless CMS. It starts by creating a new post with specified title, content, and description. It then updates the post to add a slug and retrieves the updated post data. This ensures efficient content creation and management.

**Demonstrate**  
A content manager could use this workflow to automate the process of publishing blog posts. It saves time by automatically creating and updating posts in Strapi, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Strapi credentials.  
3. Customize the content fields in the "Set" node to match your needs.  
4. Execute the workflow manually to test and verify the process.

**Practice**  
Create a test post in Strapi using this workflow. Modify the title or content in the "Set" node, run the workflow, and see how it updates in Strapi. Experiment by adding new fields to enhance the post.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can streamline content operations, making you more efficient. As a consultant, offering automated content management services can attract clients looking to optimize their digital presence, leading to increased revenue and business growth.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
