# Manual Slack Monitor Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set CalColor**.
  2. **Set CalColor** `function` — functionCode: "for (item of items) {

  switch (item.json.colorId) {
    case '1':
      calColor = 'Lavendar';
      break;
    case '2':
      calColor = '4dw_leading';

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of synchronizing your Google Calendar status with your Slack status and controlling Philips Hue lights based on calendar events. When a calendar event starts, it checks the event's color ID, assigns a corresponding status color, updates your Slack status with a matching emoji, and adjusts your Philips Hue lights to indicate whether you're busy, working personally, or available.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically signal their availability to their team and family. When they have a meeting, their Slack status and home office lights change to indicate they're busy, ensuring minimal interruptions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Calendar, Slack, and Philips Hue accounts.
3. Set up the calendar to reflect your event color codes.
4. Customize the webhook URLs for your Philips Hue lights.
5. Test the workflow to ensure that status updates and light changes occur as expected.

### Practice
Create a test event in Google Calendar with different color IDs and see how it affects your Slack status and Philips Hue lights. Change the color ID to observe different outcomes and verify that each scenario triggers correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer smart home-office integrations to clients, enhancing their productivity and communication. This expertise can differentiate your services, attract tech-savvy customers, and increase your income potential in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
