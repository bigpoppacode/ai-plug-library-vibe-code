# Manual Ical Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Send Email** `emailSend` — text: "Hey Harshil,

We are excited to invite you to the n8n community meetup!

With this email you will find the invite attached.

Looking forward to seeing you at the meetup!

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to send an email invitation for an event. It starts with a manual trigger, which when executed, creates an iCalendar event detailing the time and title of the event. The event details are then attached to an email that is sent out, inviting the recipient to the n8n community meetup.

### Demonstrate
A business owner organizing a community event could use this workflow to efficiently send calendar invites to their mailing list, ensuring all recipients have the event details saved in their calendars.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your SMTP credentials for sending emails.
3. Customize the iCalendar event details (start and end time, title).
4. Modify the email content to suit your event specifics.
5. Execute the workflow to test the email invitation process.

### Practice
Create a test event using your own email address. Execute the workflow to see how the iCalendar invite is attached to the email and ensure it arrives with the correct details. Adjust parameters as necessary.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate event invitations, saving time and ensuring consistency. This capability can enhance your service offerings, helping you attract clients who need efficient event management solutions, thus increasing your business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** smtp.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
