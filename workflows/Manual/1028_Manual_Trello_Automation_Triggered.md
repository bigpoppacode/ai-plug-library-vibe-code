  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Trello**.
  2. **Trello** `trello` — name: "={{$node["Airtable"].json["fields"]["What's the title of your talk?"]}}", listId: "", description: "=Abstract: {{$node["Airtable"].json["fields"]["Please share the abstract of your talk."]}}

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of selecting conference proposals. It starts by retrieving proposals from an Airtable database that have a total score above 15. It then uses Bannerbear to generate a promotional image for each proposal, incorporating details like the talk title and speaker's profile image. Finally, it creates a Trello card for each proposal, including details such as the talk's abstract, speaker's name, bio, and email, along with the generated image.

### Demonstrate
A conference organizer could use this workflow to streamline the process of managing speaker proposals, automatically creating marketing materials and organizing information in Trello, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Airtable, Bannerbear, and Trello accounts.
3. Set up an Airtable table with proposal details and scores.
4. Customize Bannerbear and Trello nodes to match your specific fields.
5. Execute the workflow to automate proposal selection and organization.

### Practice
Create a mock Airtable database with sample proposals. Run the workflow to see how it selects proposals, generates images, and creates Trello cards. Adjust fields and test different scenarios to ensure accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you efficiently manage event proposals, enhancing your service offerings. It can lead to increased client satisfaction, streamlined operations, and new business opportunities in event management and marketing automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableApi, bannerbearApi, trelloApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
