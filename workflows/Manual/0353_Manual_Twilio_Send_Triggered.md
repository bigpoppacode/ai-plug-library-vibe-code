# Manual Twilio Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Twilio**.
  2. **Twilio** `twilio` — to: "={{$node["Airtable"].json["fields"]["Number"]}}", from: "", message: "=Hello, {{$node["Airtable"].json["fields"]["Name"]}}!
Sending this SMS from n8n!"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending SMS messages to contacts stored in an Airtable database using Twilio. When executed, it retrieves a list of contacts from Airtable, extracts each contact's phone number and name, and sends a personalized SMS greeting using Twilio.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to send personalized promotional messages or reminders to customers stored in their Airtable database, enhancing customer engagement and communication efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and Twilio accounts.
3. Set up your Airtable table with columns for "Name" and "Number".
4. Customize the Twilio node with your sender number.
5. Execute the workflow to send SMS messages.

### Practice
Create a test Airtable base with dummy contacts and run the workflow. Verify that each contact receives a personalized SMS. Experiment by adding new contacts to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated communication solutions to clients, improving their customer outreach and potentially increasing sales. This expertise can expand your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableApi, twilioApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
