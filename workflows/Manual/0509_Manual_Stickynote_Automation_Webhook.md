# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, manualTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "372", height: "383", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "353", height: "375", content: "## Configuration 
Change the `url_to_file` parameter here to the file you want to convert"
5. **Config** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://v2.convertapi.com/convert/docx/to/pdf`
7. **Read/Write Files from Disk** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow converts a DOCX file to a PDF. It starts with a manual trigger to initiate the process. The workflow then uses a configuration node to set the URL of the DOCX file. An HTTP Request node sends this file to ConvertAPI, which performs the conversion. Finally, the Read/Write Files from Disk node saves the converted PDF file to disk.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to automate the conversion of client documents from DOCX to PDF for consistent formatting and easier sharing, enhancing the efficiency of document management.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Update the `url_to_file` in the Config node with your DOCX file URL.
3. Authenticate with ConvertAPI using your credentials.
4. Run the workflow manually to test the conversion.
5. Adjust file paths if needed for saving the output.

### Practice
Create a DOCX file and host it online. Use the workflow to convert it to PDF. Change the file URL in the workflow to test with different documents and observe the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow lets you offer document conversion services, streamlining processes for clients who need consistent file formats. This can be a valuable service in document-heavy industries, potentially increasing your client base and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpQueryAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
