  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a series of actions in Salesforce. When executed manually, it creates a new lead with specified details, updates the lead's city to Berlin, and then adds a note titled "Deal Won!" to the lead. This sequence helps manage and document sales processes efficiently within Salesforce.

### Demonstrate
A sales manager could use this workflow to streamline the process of updating leads and documenting successful deals, ensuring all team members have access to accurate and up-to-date information in Salesforce.

### Imitate
1. Import the JSON into n8n.
2. Connect your Salesforce account.
3. Adjust the lead details and note content as needed.
4. Test the workflow by executing it manually to see if it performs as expected.

### Practice

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
