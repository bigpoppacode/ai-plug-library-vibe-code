  ### Explain
This n8n workflow creates a Zoom meeting when triggered manually. Using a manual trigger node, it initiates the workflow, and the Zoom node is configured to set up a meeting with a specified topic. This simple automation makes setting up meetings quick and efficient without manual input.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline meeting setups. For example, on days with back-to-back meetings, simply executing this workflow can save time, ensuring meetings are scheduled promptly without the hassle of manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Import this workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Zoom account by configuring the Zoom node with the necessary credentials.
3. Set the meeting topic in the Zoom node parameters.
4. Execute the workflow manually to create a Zoom meeting.
5. Customize the topic or additional fields as needed.

### Practice
Create a test Zoom meeting using this workflow. Change the topic to something relevant to your needs, execute the workflow, and check your Zoom account to confirm the meeting is created. Adjust parameters to explore different configurations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate meeting scheduling, saving time and reducing administrative overhead. This skill can be offered to clients needing streamlined scheduling solutions, enhancing your service offerings and potentially increasing income as an automation consultant.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
