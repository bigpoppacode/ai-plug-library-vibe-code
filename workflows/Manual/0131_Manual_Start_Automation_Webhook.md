# Manual Start Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, manualTrigger, start.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request1**.
  2. **HTTP Request1** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile_banner.json`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating a Twitter profile banner. It starts by downloading an image from Unsplash using an HTTP request. The downloaded image is then used to update the Twitter profile banner via another HTTP request, which sends the image data to Twitter's API.

### Demonstrate
A social media manager could use this workflow to regularly update their Twitter profile banners with fresh images automatically, keeping their profile visually appealing and up to date without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the Unsplash URL to select your preferred image.
3. Connect your Twitter account via OAuth1 for authentication.
4. Execute the workflow to test the banner update.
5. Adjust the image URL or schedule the workflow for regular updates.

### Practice
Create a test Twitter account and use this workflow to update the profile banner with different images from Unsplash. Observe how the updates reflect on your Twitter profile and experiment with different image selections.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated social media management services, helping clients keep their profiles fresh and engaging. This can enhance your portfolio and attract clients seeking efficient social media solutions, potentially increasing your business income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** oAuth1Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
