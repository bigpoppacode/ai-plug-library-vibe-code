  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is a simple automation that sends an email using Mailgun when manually triggered. Upon execution, it sends a test email with a predefined subject and message to a specified recipient email address. The workflow involves two main steps: a manual trigger and the Mailgun node for email delivery.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly test email delivery functionality or send notifications without logging into an email client, ensuring communication systems work as expected before launching broader campaigns.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Mailgun credentials in n8n.
3. Customize the email parameters (e.g., subject, message, recipient).
4. Execute the workflow to test the email delivery.
5. Adjust settings as needed for different test scenarios.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to send a test email to yourself. Change the subject and message content to verify they appear correctly in your inbox. Experiment with different email addresses to ensure the workflow handles various recipients.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to efficiently test and verify email communication systems, ensuring reliability. This skill can be pivotal in offering email automation services, enhancing customer engagement, and expanding your automation business offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mailgunApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
