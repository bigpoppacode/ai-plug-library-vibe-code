  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to create a new card in Trello. It consists of a manual trigger node that, when executed, initiates the process of creating a card with the name "Hello" and the description "Here are some details" in a Trello list. The list ID needs to be specified for the card to be placed correctly.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to quickly add tasks to a Trello board during a planning session. By executing the workflow, they can ensure tasks are logged without needing to manually input them into Trello, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Trello account and specify the list ID where you want the card to be created.
3. Execute the workflow manually to create a card in the chosen Trello list.
4. Customize the card name and description as needed for your specific use case.

### Practice
Set up a test Trello board and use the workflow to create a few cards. Experiment by changing the card details and observe how they appear in Trello. This helps ensure you understand how to customize the workflow for different tasks.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline task management in Trello, making project tracking more efficient. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract clients needing task automation, and potentially increase your income by providing tailored automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
