# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:n3w-italia::AsVfsl7B`
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "556.5145228215765", height: "211.35269709543567", content: "# Step 2

Once the .jsonl file for training is uploaded (See the entire process here.: https://platform.openai.com/finetune/), a "new model" will be created and made available via …[truncated]"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "777.3941908713687", height: "265.161825726141", content: "[redacted]"
7. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
8. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
9. **Upload File** `openAi` — resource: **file**
10. **Create Fine-tuning Job** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of fine-tuning an OpenAI model. It begins with a manual trigger or a chat message, downloads a training file from Google Drive, uploads it to OpenAI, and submits a fine-tuning job. This allows users to create a customized AI model based on their specific data, enhancing the AI's performance for particular tasks.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to fine-tune an AI model for a customer service chatbot, tailoring it to better understand and respond to specific queries related to their products or services, thereby improving customer interaction and satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up the workflow in n8n.
2. Connect Google Drive and OpenAI accounts.
3. Configure a trigger (manual or chat).
4. Ensure the training file is correctly formatted and uploaded to Google Drive.
5. Test the workflow to verify it uploads the file and creates a fine-tuning job.

### Practice
Create a simple training file in JSONL format and upload it to Google Drive. Run the workflow to see how it processes the file and submits it to OpenAI for fine-tuning. Adjust the file content and observe changes in the AI model's behavior after fine-tuning.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can empower you to offer specialized AI model fine-tuning services, enabling businesses to improve their AI applications. This can increase your service value, attract more clients, and potentially lead to higher income in the AI automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, openAiApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
