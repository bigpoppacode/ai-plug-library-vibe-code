# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, manualTrigger, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "273", height: "339", content: "## Workflow Trigger
You can replace this manual trigger with another trigger type as required by your use case."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "273", height: "335", content: "## Manually Set OpenAI TTS Configuration
"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "302", height: "335", content: "## Send Request to OpenAI TTS API
"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "273", height: "278"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "299", height: "278"
8. **Set input text and TTS voice** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "{
 "input_text": "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.",
 "voice": "alloy"
}
"
9. **Send HTTP Request to OpenAI's TTS Endpoint** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow converts text into speech using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. It starts with a manual trigger to initiate the process. The workflow then sets the input text and voice parameters, and finally sends a POST request to OpenAI's TTS endpoint to generate the audio output.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically create audio versions of written content, such as blog posts or newsletters, enhancing accessibility and engagement.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up your OpenAI API credentials.  
3. Customize the input text and voice settings.  
4. Test the workflow using the manual trigger to ensure it generates the desired audio output.

**Practice:**  
Create a simple text file with different sentences. Modify the workflow to read from the file and convert each sentence to speech. Test and listen to the outputs to understand the TTS capabilities.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer audio content creation services, expanding your service offerings and generating additional income. It positions you as a provider of innovative solutions in the AI automation space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
