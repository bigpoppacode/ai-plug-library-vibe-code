  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves all stories in Storyblok that start with the word "release" and publishes them. It begins with a manual trigger that activates the process, fetching the relevant stories and then publishing each one. This automation ensures that stories following a naming convention are published efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A content manager could use this workflow to automatically publish new product release notes stored in Storyblok, ensuring they are made public as soon as they are ready, without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Storyblok account.
3. Ensure stories are named with "release" to match the filter.
4. Trigger the workflow manually to test it.
5. Verify that the stories are published as expected.

### Practice
Create a test story in Storyblok with the title starting as "release". Run the workflow manually and observe how it is published. Adjust the filter to test different naming conventions and see the workflow's response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated content management solutions, streamlining publishing processes. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and boost your income in the automation and content management space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
