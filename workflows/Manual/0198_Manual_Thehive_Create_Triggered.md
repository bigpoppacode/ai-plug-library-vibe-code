# Manual Thehive Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using theHive×3, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **TheHive2**.
  2. **TheHive2** `theHive` — resource: **case**, operation: **get**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates case management in TheHive, a cybersecurity incident response platform. It starts by manually triggering the creation of a new case with specific details like tags, owner, and severity. The workflow then updates the case severity and retrieves the case details, streamlining the process of case management for security teams.

### Demonstrate
A cybersecurity team could use this workflow to efficiently manage incidents. When a new threat is identified, the workflow quickly creates a case in TheHive, updates its severity based on further analysis, and retrieves the case details for review, saving time and reducing manual entry errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your TheHive API credentials.
3. Customize the case details like tags, owner, and severity.
4. Trigger the workflow manually to create, update, and get a case.
5. Verify the case details in TheHive to ensure correct setup.

### Practice
Create a test case in TheHive with dummy data. Run the workflow to create, update, and retrieve the case. Check TheHive to confirm the case is created and updated as expected. Adjust parameters and rerun to see different results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer incident management automation services to cybersecurity teams, increasing your service offerings. By reducing manual tasks, you can enhance operational efficiency, leading to higher client satisfaction and potential revenue growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** theHiveApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
