  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically monitors Twitter for mentions of "@n8n_io" every minute. It filters out new mentions that haven't been processed before, then sends a notification with the tweet's content and link to a RocketChat channel. This ensures that the team stays updated with real-time mentions, aiding in social media management and engagement.

### Demonstrate
A social media manager could use this workflow to stay updated on brand mentions, allowing them to respond quickly to user queries or comments, enhancing customer engagement and brand presence online.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Twitter and RocketChat credentials.
3. Set the Cron node to trigger every minute.
4. Customize the Twitter search term and RocketChat channel as needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure new mentions are correctly identified and notified.

### Practice
Create a test Twitter account and mention "@n8n_io" in a tweet. Observe how the workflow filters and sends a notification to your RocketChat channel. Modify the search term to see how it affects the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer social media monitoring services, improving client engagement strategies and potentially increasing your service offerings. This can lead to higher client satisfaction and more business opportunities in digital marketing and automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** twitterOAuth1Api, rocketchatApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
