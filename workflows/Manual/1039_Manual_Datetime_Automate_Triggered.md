# Manual Datetime Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, dateTime.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Date & Time**.
  2. **Date & Time** `dateTime` — value: "14/02/2020", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow is a simple automation that starts with a manual trigger. When executed, it moves to a Date & Time node that processes a specific date, "14/02/2020", in the format "DD/MM/YYYY". This workflow is a basic example to demonstrate how to use date manipulation in n8n.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer might use this workflow to test date formatting functions or to create a timestamp for logging an event in a more complex automation.

**Imitate**  
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Add a Date & Time node and set the date to "14/02/2020".
4. Connect the nodes.
5. Execute the workflow to see how the date is processed.

**Practice**  
Create a similar workflow, but change the date format to "MM/DD/YYYY" and observe the output. Experiment with different dates and formats to understand how n8n handles date conversions.

**WIIFM**  
Understanding this workflow helps you manage and manipulate dates within automations. This skill is crucial for creating workflows that depend on time-based triggers or logging, adding value to your services and attracting clients looking for precise data management solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
