# Manual Asana Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, asana.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Asana**.
  2. **Asana** `asana` — name: "", workspace: "", otherProperties: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a new task in Asana. It begins with a manual trigger, allowing the user to execute the workflow on demand. Once triggered, it proceeds to create a task in a specified Asana workspace. The task's details, such as name and other properties, can be customized within the workflow.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to quickly add tasks to Asana during meetings. Instead of manually entering tasks afterward, they can execute the workflow in real-time, ensuring nothing is forgotten and tasks are tracked immediately.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Asana account by providing the necessary API credentials.
3. Define the task details, such as name and workspace, in the Asana node.
4. Test the workflow by executing it manually to ensure tasks are created as expected in Asana.

### Practice
Create a test task in Asana using this workflow. Try modifying task properties like name and workspace, then execute the workflow to see the changes in Asana. Experiment by adding different task details to understand how each field affects the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline project management processes, saving time and reducing errors. By offering this automation to clients, you can enhance their productivity and potentially increase your service offerings, leading to new business opportunities and revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** asanaApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
