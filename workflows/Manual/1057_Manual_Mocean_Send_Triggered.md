# Manual Mocean Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, mocean.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Mocean**.
  2. **Mocean** `mocean` — to: "", from: "", message: ""
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to send an SMS message using the Mocean API. It is triggered manually by the user, and upon execution, it uses the Mocean node to send a text message from a specified sender to a recipient, with a custom message content. The workflow is inactive by default and requires configuration of the recipient, sender, and message details.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to send promotional messages or alerts to customers. For instance, a restaurant might use it to notify customers of daily specials or discounts.

- **Imitate:** To apply this workflow, import it into your n8n instance, configure the Mocean node with your API credentials, and fill in the "to," "from," and "message" fields with the appropriate phone numbers and message text. Execute the workflow manually to test sending an SMS.

- **Practice:** Create a test workflow using the Mocean node. Set up a manual trigger and input dummy phone numbers and messages. Execute the workflow to see how it sends an SMS. Adjust the message content and recipient details to understand how changes affect the output.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer SMS notification services to businesses, enhancing customer engagement and communication. This can expand your service offerings, attract new clients, and generate additional income for your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
