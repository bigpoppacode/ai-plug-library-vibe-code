# Manual GoogleSheets Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Run every 5 minutes**.
  2. **Run every 5 minutes** `interval` — unit: "minutes", interval: "5"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of checking a Google Sheets document every 5 minutes to identify new entries. It verifies whether each entry has been processed by checking a "Processed" field. If the field is empty, it performs a specific action (currently a placeholder) and then marks the row as processed by updating the field with the current timestamp.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to regularly process new customer orders from a Google Sheet, ensuring each order is acknowledged and marked as processed, preventing duplicate processing.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your Google Sheets account. 3. Set up your Google Sheets document with a "Processed" column. 4. Define the action to perform on new entries. 5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates the "Processed" column correctly.

**Practice:** Create a Google Sheet with sample data, including a "Processed" column. Run the workflow and observe how it updates the sheet. Modify some entries to see how the workflow processes them.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to automate routine data handling tasks, increasing efficiency and accuracy. This can enhance service offerings, attract clients looking for data automation solutions, and create recurring revenue opportunities in an AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
