  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating, updating, and retrieving a profile using Humantic AI. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves a profile from Humantic AI using a LinkedIn URL, updates the profile with additional information, and then retrieves the updated profile with a focus on hiring insights.

### Demonstrate
A recruiter could use this workflow to gather and update candidate profiles from LinkedIn, ensuring they have the most current data and insights for hiring decisions, thus streamlining the recruitment process and improving accuracy.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Humantic AI account.
3. Customize the LinkedIn URL in the Humantic AI node.
4. Execute the workflow to see how it retrieves and updates profiles.
5. Adjust parameters to align with your specific use case.

### Practice
Create a LinkedIn profile for testing and run the workflow to update and retrieve it. Observe the changes and insights provided by Humantic AI, and tweak the workflow to fit different personas or criteria.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer enhanced recruitment automation services, providing clients with valuable candidate insights and streamlined processes, potentially increasing your service value and client base in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** humanticAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
