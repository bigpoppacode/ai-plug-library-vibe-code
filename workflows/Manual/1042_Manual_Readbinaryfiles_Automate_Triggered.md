# Manual Readbinaryfiles Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Read Binary Files**.
  2. **Read Binary Files** `readBinaryFiles` — fileSelector: "/data/lol/*.jpg"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of reading image files from a specified directory on a server. It starts with a manual trigger node that, when executed, initiates the reading of all JPEG image files located in the `/data/lol/` directory. This setup is useful for automations that require batch processing of image files, such as resizing, watermarking, or uploading to a cloud service.

### Demonstrate
Imagine a photography business that needs to regularly upload new images to a cloud storage service for client access. This workflow can automate the retrieval of all new images from a local directory, preparing them for further processing or uploading.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow JSON into your n8n instance.
2. Ensure your server has access to the directory `/data/lol/` with JPEG images.
3. Execute the workflow manually to test the file reading process.
4. Adapt the file path in the `fileSelector` if your images are stored elsewhere.

### Practice
Create a test directory with a few sample JPEG images. Run the workflow to see how it reads the files. Modify the images or directory path and observe how the workflow handles the changes. This will help you understand the workflow's flexibility and robustness.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can offer automated image processing services to clients, saving them time and ensuring consistency in file handling. This capability can enhance your service offerings and potentially increase your revenue through new automation opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
