  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to manually trigger a job on Rundeck, a popular open-source automation tool. When you click "execute" in n8n, it sends a command to Rundeck to start a specific job identified by the job ID "f02c7661-6f75-4ffe-958c-c0ed5f9bc9e6". This setup allows you to automate complex tasks managed by Rundeck directly from n8n.

### Demonstrate

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Rundeck credentials in n8n.
3. Customize the job ID in the Rundeck node to match the job you want to trigger.
4. Click "execute" in n8n to test the workflow and ensure the Rundeck job runs as expected.

### Practice
Create a simple job in Rundeck, like printing a message to the console. Use this workflow to trigger that job from n8n. Observe how n8n communicates with Rundeck and confirm the job executes successfully.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automation solutions that integrate n8n with Rundeck, expanding your service offerings. This can lead to more efficient operations for clients, increasing your value as a consultant and potentially boosting your income through enhanced automation capabilities.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
