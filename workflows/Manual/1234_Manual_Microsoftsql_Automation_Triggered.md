# Manual MicrosoftSQL Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, microsoftSql.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Microsoft SQL**.
  2. **Microsoft SQL** `microsoftSql` — operation: **executeQuery**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to execute an SQL query on a Microsoft SQL database. It starts with a manual trigger node, meaning you initiate the process by clicking 'execute'. Once triggered, the workflow runs a specified SQL query on the connected Microsoft SQL database. This setup allows users to perform database operations like retrieving, updating, or deleting data as needed.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly generate reports from a Microsoft SQL database when needed, without writing SQL queries each time. For instance, they could pull sales data to analyze performance or check inventory levels.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Microsoft SQL database by providing the necessary credentials.
3. Specify the SQL query you want to execute in the 'Microsoft SQL' node.
4. Trigger the workflow by clicking 'execute' to run your query and retrieve the data.

### Practice
Set up a test Microsoft SQL database with sample data. Create a simple query to select data from a table. Run the workflow to see the results. Experiment by modifying the query to retrieve different data or perform updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline database interactions, saving you time and reducing errors in data handling. This skill can attract clients needing efficient data management solutions and enhance your service offerings in automation and data processing.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** microsoftSql.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
