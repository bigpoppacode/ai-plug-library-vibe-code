# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×3, manualTrigger, readWriteFile.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "218", height: "132", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Download first remote PDF File** `httpRequest` — url: `https://cdn.convertapi.com/public/files/demo.pdf`
5. **Download second PDF File** `httpRequest` — url: `https://cdn.convertapi.com/public/files/demo2.pdf`
6. **PDF merge API HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://v2.convertapi.com/convert/pdf/to/merge`
7. **Write Result File to Disk** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading two remote PDF files, merging them into a single document using the ConvertAPI, and saving the merged PDF to your local disk. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves the PDFs, merges them using an API call, and writes the final result to a file.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to combine multiple PDF reports into a single document for easier distribution and archiving, saving time and ensuring consistency in report presentations.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect to ConvertAPI with your credentials.  
3. Adjust the URLs to point to your PDF files.  
4. Test the workflow to ensure the PDFs download, merge, and save correctly.  
5. Activate the workflow for regular use.

**Practice:**  
Create a test scenario by using sample PDF files. Run the workflow to see how it merges the files. Experiment with different PDF sources to understand how the workflow handles various inputs.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can enable you to offer PDF merging services to clients, adding value to your automation business. It can also help you streamline document management tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy in business operations.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpQueryAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
