  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a new chat room in Matrix, inviting members from an existing room, and sending a welcome message. It starts by manually triggering the workflow, creating a new room, checking for members in another room, inviting those who are not already in the new room, and finally sending a welcome message to the newly created room.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to create dedicated project rooms in a messaging platform, ensuring all relevant team members are invited automatically, thus streamlining communication and collaboration.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Matrix API credentials.
3. Define the existing room ID and new room details.
4. Execute the workflow to test room creation and member invitations.
5. Customize the welcome message as needed.

### Practice
Create a test room in Matrix and simulate inviting a few test users. Run the workflow to see how it automates the creation and invitation process. Experiment with different room settings and welcome messages.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer efficient communication solutions to clients, fostering collaboration and saving time in setting up project-specific chat rooms. This can enhance your service offerings and increase client value, potentially boosting revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
