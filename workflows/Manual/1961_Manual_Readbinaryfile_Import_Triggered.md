# Manual Readbinaryfile Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Read From File** `readBinaryFile` — filePath: "/tmp/t1.csv"
4. **Convert To Spreadsheet** `spreadsheetFile` — options: "[object Object]"
5. **Postgres** `postgres` — table: `[object Object]`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of importing data from a CSV file into a Postgres database using n8n. When manually triggered, it reads a CSV file located at "/tmp/t1.csv", converts the data into a spreadsheet format, and then uploads it into a specified table in a Postgres database. This ensures that data from CSV files is efficiently transferred into a structured database format.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the weekly import of sales data from a CSV file into their Postgres database, ensuring that their database is consistently up-to-date without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the CSV file path in the "Read From File" node.
3. Configure the "Postgres" node with your database credentials and table details.
4. Trigger the workflow manually to test the setup.
5. Adjust the workflow to automate imports as needed.

### Practice
Create a CSV file with sample data and place it in the "/tmp" directory. Run the workflow and verify the data is correctly imported into your Postgres database table. Experiment with different data types to see how they are handled.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline data management tasks, making you more efficient and freeing up time for strategic work. Offering this as a service can attract clients needing regular data imports, providing a steady income stream in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
