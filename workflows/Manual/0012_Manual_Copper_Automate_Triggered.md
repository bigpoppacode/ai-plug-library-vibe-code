  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing contact information in Copper CRM. It starts by manually triggering the workflow, which creates a contact with a specified name and email in Copper. Then, it updates the contact's phone number and retrieves the updated contact information, ensuring that the CRM data is current and accurate.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their CRM always has the most up-to-date contact information, reducing manual data entry errors and improving communication efficiency with clients.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n setup.
2. Connect your Copper API credentials.
3. Set up the manual trigger to start the workflow.
4. Customize the contact details (name, email, phone number) as needed.
5. Test the workflow to confirm it updates and retrieves contact info correctly.

### Practice
Create a dummy contact in your Copper account, then run the workflow to update its phone number and retrieve the updated details. Check the Copper CRM to verify the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer CRM management services, improving client data accuracy and saving time. This can lead to better client relationships and open opportunities to upsell additional automation services in your business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
