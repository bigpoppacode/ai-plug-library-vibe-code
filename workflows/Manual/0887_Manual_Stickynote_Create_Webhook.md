# Manual Stickynote Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×6, httpRequest×2, convertToFile×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "320", content: "### 🧪 Manual Trigger
Starts the workflow manually. Ideal for testing and debugging purposes.
"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "280", height: "440"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "280", height: "320"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "280", height: "440"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "280", height: "360"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "700", height: "980"
9. **Create image call** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations`
10. **Convert json binary to File** `convertToFile` — operation: **toBinary**
11. **Edit Image (OpenAI)** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/images/edits`
12. **Convert json binary to File final** `convertToFile` — operation: **toBinary**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow uses OpenAI's API to generate and edit images. It starts with a manual trigger, generates an image based on a prompt (e.g., "A cute red panda like dark super hero"), converts the image from JSON to a binary file, edits the image (e.g., adds a mask with horns), and finally converts the edited image back into a binary file for download or preview.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to quickly generate and edit images for a new product line, saving time and effort on manual design tasks and allowing for rapid iteration and creativity.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI account with the necessary API credentials.
3. Customize the prompts in the image generation and editing nodes to fit your needs.
4. Test the workflow to ensure images are generated and edited correctly.
5. Use the final output as needed for your projects.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that generates an image of a fantasy creature, then edits it to add a magical aura. Observe the changes and try different prompts to see how the workflow handles various requests.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer unique image generation and editing services, enhancing your portfolio and attracting clients who need creative digital content. This skill can differentiate you in the market, enabling you to charge higher fees for custom automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
