  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of replacing images in Google Docs with new images sourced from a URL database. It involves copying a template document, finding and replacing an image, and optionally making the document shareable and downloading it in PDF or DOCX format. This is ideal for businesses needing to update documents dynamically with custom images.
  
- **Demonstrate:** A design agency could use this workflow to personalize client proposals with specific branding images, ensuring each document is tailored and professional without manual adjustments, saving time and enhancing client satisfaction.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect to your Google Drive and set up OAuth credentials. 3. Customize the image URL in the "Image URL" node. 4. Create a template with a placeholder image in Google Drive. 5. Test the workflow to ensure it replaces the image and downloads correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a simple Google Doc template with a placeholder image. Use the workflow to replace this image with one from a URL, then download the document. Experiment with different images and templates to see how the workflow adapts.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer dynamic document creation services, enhancing your automation skill set. This can improve client offerings, providing tailored documentation solutions and potentially increasing revenue through high-value services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
