# Manual N8n Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, n8n, code.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "548.6551724137931", height: "191.08045977011497", content: "## v1 Helper

ℹ️ This workflow is to be run **after upgrading to n8n v1**.

This workflow returns all locations where a node in an active workflow contains a parameter using an **e…[truncated]"
4. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]"
5. **Find params with affected expressions** `code` — jsCode: "const AFFECTED_EXTENSIONS = ['beginningOf', 'endOfMonth', 'minus', 'plus'];

const isExpression = (value) => typeof value === 'string' && value.startsWith('={{');

const containsAn…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow helps identify nodes in active workflows that use parameters with expressions affected by changes in n8n version 1. It scans for expressions using certain extensions like 'beginningOf', 'endOfMonth', 'minus', and 'plus' to ensure workflows still behave as expected after an upgrade.

### Demonstrate
A developer upgrading to n8n v1 would use this workflow to identify and check any affected expressions in their existing workflows, ensuring that no automation is disrupted by the version change.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your n8n account for access.
3. Execute the workflow manually.
4. Review the output to identify affected expressions.
5. Verify and adjust the workflows as needed.

### Practice
Create a test workflow with expressions using 'beginningOf' or 'endOfMonth'. Run this helper workflow to see how it identifies these expressions. Modify the expressions and rerun to observe changes in detection.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to ensure seamless transitions when upgrading n8n versions. This skill helps maintain uninterrupted automation services for clients, enhancing reliability and potentially increasing your service offerings and client satisfaction.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
