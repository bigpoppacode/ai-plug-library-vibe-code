# Manual Stickynote Import Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, manualTrigger, stickyNote.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "260.14166686078653", height: "552.0076928452548", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Set Parameter** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Get Long Lived FB User Token** `httpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`
6. **Get Long Lived FB Page Token** `httpRequest` — method: **=GET**, url: `=https://graph.facebook.com/v20.0/{{ $('Set Parameter').item.json.app_scoped_user_id }}/accounts`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of obtaining long-lived Facebook user and page access tokens. It starts with a manual trigger, sets necessary parameters like client ID and secret, and then makes HTTP requests to Facebook's API to exchange short-lived tokens for long-lived ones. This ensures that applications maintain access to Facebook resources without frequent reauthorization, streamlining integration and reducing manual token management.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer managing a Facebook app could use this workflow to automate the process of regularly updating access tokens, ensuring uninterrupted access to Facebook APIs for data retrieval or posting content.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set your Facebook app's client ID, client secret, and user access token in the "Set Parameter" node.
3. Run the workflow manually to test and ensure it retrieves the long-lived tokens correctly.
4. Schedule the workflow to run periodically to refresh tokens automatically.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Facebook app and use the workflow to retrieve both user and page tokens. Adjust the parameters and observe how the tokens are retrieved and updated, ensuring you understand each step involved.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated token management as a service, reducing downtime and manual intervention for clients using Facebook APIs. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract more clients, and increase your revenue in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
