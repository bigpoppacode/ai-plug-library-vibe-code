# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, manualTrigger, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "273", height: "339", content: "## Workflow Trigger
You can replace this manual trigger with another trigger type as required by your use case."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "273", height: "335", content: "## Manually Set OpenAI TTS Configuration
"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "302", height: "335", content: "## Send Request to OpenAI TTS API
"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "273", height: "278"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "299", height: "278"
8. **Set input text and TTS voice** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "{
  "input_text": "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.",
  "voice": "alloy"
}
"
9. **Send HTTP Request to OpenAI's TTS Endpoint** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow takes a piece of text and converts it into speech using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. It starts with a manual trigger, sets the input text and voice type, and then sends this data to OpenAI's API, which returns an audio file in .mp3 format.

### Demonstrate
A podcast creator could use this workflow to quickly convert written scripts into audio files, saving time on voice recording and editing, ensuring consistent voice quality across episodes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI account.
3. Modify the input text in the "Set input text and TTS voice" node.
4. Run the workflow to generate speech from your text.
5. Download the resulting .mp3 file from the output.

### Practice
Create a test workflow using different text inputs and voices. Experiment with the OpenAI TTS options to see how the output changes. Try changing the trigger type to automate the process based on your needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated audio content creation services. This can attract clients needing consistent and high-quality voiceovers, expanding your service offerings and increasing your income potential in the AI automation space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
