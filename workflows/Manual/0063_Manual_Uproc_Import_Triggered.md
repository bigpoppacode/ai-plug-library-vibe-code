# Manual uProc Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, functionItem, uproc.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Get DNS records**.
  2. **Get DNS records** `uproc` — tool: "getDomainRecords", group: "internet", domain: "= {{$node["Create Domain Item"].json["domain"]}}"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves DNS records for a specified domain. It starts with a manual trigger, sets the domain to "n8n.io", and then uses the Uproc API to fetch DNS records for that domain. This helps in monitoring or verifying DNS settings for websites or applications.

### Demonstrate
A web developer might use this workflow to verify DNS configurations when deploying a new website, ensuring that all DNS entries are correctly set up before going live to avoid website downtime or accessibility issues.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Uproc account.
3. Change the domain in the "Create Domain Item" node to your desired domain.
4. Execute the workflow manually to fetch DNS records.
5. Adjust any settings as needed for your specific use case.

### Practice
Create a test workflow with a different domain name. Run the workflow and compare the DNS records fetched with those available in a DNS management tool to verify accuracy. Modify the domain name and observe changes in results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer DNS monitoring and verification services. This can enhance your service offerings in web development or IT support, providing clients with reliable DNS management solutions and potentially increasing your revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** uprocApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
