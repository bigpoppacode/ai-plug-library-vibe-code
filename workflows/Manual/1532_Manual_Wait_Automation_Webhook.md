# Manual Wait Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Basic Params** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "[redacted]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting a three-view orthographic projection into a dynamic video. It captures front and side views of an image using GPT-4o, generates a rotation video with the Kling model, verifies the generation status, and retrieves the final video output.

**Demonstrate:**  
A digital marketing agency might use this workflow to create engaging 3D animations from 2D product images, enhancing their promotional content and making it more interactive for customers.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your API credentials for the services used.  
3. Set the image URLs in the 'Basic Params' node.  
4. Run the workflow to test video generation.  
5. Modify parameters to fit different image sources or video requirements.

**Practice:**  
Create a test image with front and side views. Use the workflow to generate a video. Change the rotation direction in the prompt and observe the output. Experiment with different image inputs to see how the workflow adapts.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can enable you to offer unique video content creation services, attracting clients in creative industries. It provides an edge in content marketing, potentially increasing your business's revenue and client base in the AI automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
