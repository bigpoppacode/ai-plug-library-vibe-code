# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, readWriteFile×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://www.intewa.com/fileadmin/documents/pdf-file.pdf`
4. **HTTP Request2** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf`
5. **Merge** `merge` — configured for its default action.
6. **Merge PDF1** `mergePdfs` — configured for its default action.
7. **Read/Write Files from Disk** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
8. **Read/Write Files from Disk4** `readWriteFile` — options: "[object Object]", fileSelector: "test.pdf"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving two PDF files from specified URLs, merging them into a single PDF, and then saving the merged document to disk. It starts with a manual trigger, downloads the PDFs using HTTP requests, merges them, and writes the final file to a specified location, ensuring efficient document management.

### Demonstrate
A consultant can use this workflow to automate document management tasks for a client, such as compiling monthly reports from multiple sources into a single document, saving time and ensuring consistency in document handling.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Configure the HTTP Request nodes with the URLs of the PDFs you want to merge.
3. Set the file path in the Read/Write Files node to where you want the merged PDF saved.
4. Run the workflow to test and verify the output.

### Practice
Create a workflow using different PDF URLs. Run the workflow to see how it handles merging and saving. Change the file paths and test with different PDF combinations to understand the workflow's flexibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated document management services, saving clients time and improving their operational efficiency. This skill can enhance your service offerings, leading to increased client satisfaction and potential revenue growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** customJsApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
