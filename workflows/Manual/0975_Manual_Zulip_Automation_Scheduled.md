  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing open support tickets from Zammad and sending a daily report to a Zulip chat stream for customer support. It starts with a scheduled trigger every weekday morning, retrieves all support tickets, filters them by status (new, open, pending reminder, pending close), and sends a summary message to the Zulip stream.

### Demonstrate
A customer support manager could use this workflow to get a daily overview of ticket statuses, ensuring the team is aware of pending tasks and can prioritize their workload effectively.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and connect your Zammad and Zulip accounts.
2. Import the workflow JSON into n8n.
3. Customize the cron schedule and Zulip stream details as needed.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and sends the correct ticket summary.

### Practice
Create a test Zammad environment with dummy tickets, then run the workflow to observe how it filters and sends the ticket summary. Adjust the cron schedule to test the workflow at different times.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated support ticket tracking services, improving team efficiency and client satisfaction. This can enhance your value proposition as a consultant or business owner, potentially increasing your revenue through better service offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** zammadTokenAuthApi, zulipApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
