# Manual EditImage Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, editImage, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://picsum.photos/200/300`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to fetch a random image from an online source (Picsum) and then process it to extract some information about the image. It starts with a manual trigger, which means you need to click 'execute' to start the workflow. The HTTP Request node is used to fetch the image, and the Edit Image node processes this image to retrieve information like dimensions or format.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer needs a random image for a placeholder in a web design project. This workflow can fetch and process an image quickly, saving the designer time in searching for suitable placeholder images manually.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the nodes: Manual Trigger, HTTP Request, and Edit Image.
3. Configure the HTTP Request node with the URL `https://picsum.photos/200/300`.
4. Connect the nodes as outlined.
5. Test the workflow by clicking 'execute' to fetch and process an image.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow but modify the image URL to fetch images of different sizes. Observe how the Edit Image node processes images of varying dimensions and formats.

### WIIFM
Learning this workflow equips you with a basic understanding of fetching and processing images automatically. This skill can enhance your service offerings in web design or content creation by automating image handling, saving time, and increasing efficiency.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
