# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://n8n-lessons.bubbleapps.io/version-test/api/1.1/obj/user`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to access user data from a Bubble application. It starts with a manual trigger, allowing the user to initiate the process by clicking 'execute'. The workflow then makes an HTTP request to a specified Bubble API endpoint to retrieve user data. This setup is useful for accessing and integrating Bubble app data into other systems or processes.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically pull user data from their Bubble app into a CRM system, ensuring their customer database is always up-to-date without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Bubble app by setting up the HTTP authentication.
3. Customize the API endpoint URL if needed.
4. Test the manual trigger to ensure data retrieval works as expected.

### Practice
Create a test Bubble app with a few user entries. Use the workflow to fetch and display this data, verifying the integration by comparing it with the original data in Bubble.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to seamlessly integrate Bubble's powerful app-building capabilities with other systems, enhancing your service offerings. This could lead to increased efficiency and client satisfaction, ultimately boosting your income potential in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
