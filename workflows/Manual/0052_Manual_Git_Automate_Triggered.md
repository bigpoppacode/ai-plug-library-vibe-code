# Manual Git Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using git×4, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Git3**.
  2. **Git3** `git` — operation: **push**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of adding files to a Git repository, committing the changes, and pushing them to a remote repository. It starts with a manual trigger, adds a specified file (`README.md`), commits the changes with a message, and finally pushes the commit to the repository.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the process of updating documentation in a Git repository. Whenever they update the `README.md` file, they can run this workflow to automatically commit and push the changes, ensuring the documentation is always up-to-date.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Git repository credentials.
3. Modify the workflow to specify the file paths and repository details.
4. Execute the workflow to add, commit, and push changes to your repository.

### Practice
Create a test Git repository and use this workflow to automatically commit and push a simple text file. Experiment by making changes to the file and observing how the workflow updates the repository.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline your development process, reducing manual Git operations and saving time. It can enhance your productivity, allowing you to focus on coding while the workflow handles repetitive Git tasks, adding value to your services as a developer or consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
