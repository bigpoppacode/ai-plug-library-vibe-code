# Manual Humanticai Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Humantic AI2**.
  2. **Humantic AI2** `humanticAi` — operation: **get**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating, updating, and retrieving a profile using Humantic AI. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves a LinkedIn profile from Humantic AI, performs an HTTP request (though the specific action isn't detailed), updates the profile with additional information, and finally retrieves the updated profile focused on hiring persona insights.

### Demonstrate
A recruiter could use this workflow to automatically update and retrieve candidate profiles from Humantic AI, gaining insights into their hiring persona. This streamlines the recruitment process by quickly accessing personality data to better match candidates to job roles.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Humantic AI account with the required API credentials.
3. Set the LinkedIn profile URL you want to analyze.
4. Execute the workflow manually to see how profiles are created, updated, and retrieved.
5. Adjust the workflow to fit other LinkedIn profiles or personas.

### Practice
Create a small test workflow in n8n that uses a manual trigger to fetch your own LinkedIn profile with Humantic AI, update it, and retrieve the insights. Observe how the data changes at each step, and try customizing the profile URL to see different results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated personality profiling services to recruitment agencies, enhancing their candidate evaluation processes. This can open new revenue streams and position you as an expert in AI-driven recruitment solutions, increasing your business value and client base.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** humanticAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
