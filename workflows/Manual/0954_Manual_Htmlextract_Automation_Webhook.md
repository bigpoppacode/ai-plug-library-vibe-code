# Manual Htmlextract Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using htmlExtract×2, manualTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTML Extract1**.
  2. **HTML Extract1** `htmlExtract` — options: "[object Object]", dataPropertyName: "item", extractionValues: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting article titles and their URLs from the Hacker Noon website. It begins with a manual trigger, fetching the HTML content of the homepage. The workflow then extracts all header tags (`h2`) and further extracts anchor tags (`a`) within those headers to obtain article titles and URLs.

### Demonstrate
A content curator could use this workflow to quickly compile a list of new articles from Hacker Noon, streamlining the process of generating content summaries or newsletters to keep their audience informed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the HTTP Request node to fetch the desired webpage.
3. Use the HTML Extract nodes to specify which HTML elements (like `h2` and `a`) to extract.
4. Run the workflow to see extracted titles and URLs.
5. Customize the CSS selectors to fit different webpage structures.

### Practice
Create a new workflow to extract article titles and URLs from a different website. Use the CSS selectors to target different HTML elements and compare results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to automate web data extraction, a valuable service for businesses needing constant updates on industry trends, competitor analysis, or content curation, thus expanding your service offerings and boosting potential income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
