  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works

  2. **OpenThesaurus** `openThesaurus` — text: "Hallo", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to find synonyms for a German word using the OpenThesaurus service. When executed, it takes the word "Hallo" as input and queries OpenThesaurus for synonyms, providing alternative words with similar meanings.

**Demonstrate:** A German language teacher might use this workflow to quickly find synonyms for vocabulary lessons, helping students expand their vocabulary and understand the nuances of word usage in different contexts.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment. 2. Change the "text" parameter in the OpenThesaurus node to the German word you want synonyms for. 3. Execute the workflow manually to get the synonyms output.

**Practice:** Create a list of German words you frequently use. Run the workflow for each word to find synonyms, and compile a list to enhance your German language teaching materials or personal study notes.

**WIIFM:** By mastering this workflow, you can offer language enrichment services or tools that enhance learning experiences. This skill can be leveraged to attract clients in educational sectors or language learning platforms, adding value to your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
