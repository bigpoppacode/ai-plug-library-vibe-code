# Manual Gmail Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Gmail2** `gmail` — resource: **messageLabel**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email management by working with Gmail labels. It identifies all emails with a specific label, removes that label, and then adds a new label. This is useful for managing email workflows, such as categorizing or prioritizing messages.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to manage customer inquiries. By changing email labels, they can track which emails have been reviewed, responded to, or need further action, improving their customer service process.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Gmail account to n8n.
3. Set the label IDs for the emails you want to manage.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it updates labels as expected.

### Practice
Create a test Gmail account and label some emails with a test label. Run the workflow to see how it changes the labels. Adjust the label IDs and test with different scenarios to understand how label management works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline your email management, saving time and reducing errors. It enhances your ability to offer efficient email organization services, attracting more clients and boosting your automation business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
