  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending SMS messages using ClickSend. It begins with a manual trigger to test the workflow. The "Set SMS data" node allows you to specify the message text and recipient's phone number, including the international prefix. Finally, the "Send SMS" node uses an HTTP POST request to ClickSend's API to deliver the message.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to send promotional SMS messages to customers. This ensures timely communication, improves customer engagement, and can boost sales during special promotions or events.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Register for ClickSend and obtain your API key.
3. Configure the "Send SMS" node with your ClickSend credentials.
4. Set the text and recipient in the "Set SMS data" node.
5. Test the workflow to ensure the SMS is sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a test workflow using your phone number and a simple message. Run the workflow to send yourself an SMS. Modify the message and recipient details to observe how the changes are reflected in the SMS you receive.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated SMS services to businesses, enhancing their communication strategy. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and open new revenue streams by offering SMS marketing solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
