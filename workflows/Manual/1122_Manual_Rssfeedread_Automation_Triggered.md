# Manual Rssfeedread Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using rssFeedRead, manualTrigger, code.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Code** `code` — jsCode: "return [
  {
    json: {
      url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io',

    }
  }
];"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow reads RSS feeds from two different sources, Medium and Dev.to, using a manual trigger to start. It retrieves the URLs of the feeds, loops through them, and reads the content of each feed. This automation helps in aggregating content from multiple sources efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A content curator could use this workflow to gather articles from Medium and Dev.to for their newsletter. By automating feed reading, they ensure they always have the latest content to share with their audience.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Ensure you have the necessary nodes: Manual Trigger, Code, Loop Over Items, and RSS Feed Read.
3. Customize the RSS feed URLs if needed.
4. Execute the workflow manually to test its functionality.

### Practice
Create a new RSS feed reader by adding more URLs to the Code node. Test the workflow by executing it and checking the results to ensure all feeds are read correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently aggregate content, which can be used to engage your audience or clients. It enhances your service offerings by automating content curation, saving time, and potentially generating income through improved content strategies.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
