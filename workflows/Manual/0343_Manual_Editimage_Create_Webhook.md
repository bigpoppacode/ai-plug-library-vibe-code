# Manual EditImage Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, editImage, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://docs.n8n.io/assets/img/final-workflow.f380b957.png`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow downloads an image from a specified URL and adds custom text to it. When executed, it fetches the image file from the internet, then uses the "Edit Image" node to overlay the text "This is n8n" onto the image at a specified position and font size.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically add branding or promotional text to product images before uploading them to a website or social media, saving time on manual editing.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Configure the HTTP Request node with your image URL.
4. Adjust the "Edit Image" node with desired text and positioning.
5. Execute the workflow to test the image editing.

### Practice
Create a simple image with basic text using an online tool. Set up the workflow to fetch this image and add additional text to it. Experiment with different text positions and sizes to see the effects.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated image editing services, enhancing your portfolio in digital marketing and content creation. This can attract clients looking for efficient ways to manage visual content, increasing your business opportunities and income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
