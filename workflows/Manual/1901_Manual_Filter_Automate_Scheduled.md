# Manual Filter Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using n8n×2, manualTrigger, filter.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Get Auto Resume Workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]"
5. **Find Deactivated Workflows** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
6. **Activate Workflow** `n8n` — operation: **activate**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically reactivates workflows that have been deactivated. It runs every four hours to check for workflows tagged with "auto_resume:true" that are not active and reactivates them. This ensures that any critical workflows that have been unintentionally deactivated are resumed without manual intervention, maintaining business continuity.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to ensure essential automations remain active, reducing downtime and maintaining operational efficiency. For example, if a crucial order processing workflow goes offline, this automation will reactivate it, preventing potential business disruptions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your n8n account for API access.
3. Schedule the trigger to run every four hours.
4. Ensure your workflows are tagged with "auto_resume:true".
5. Test the workflow by deactivating a tagged workflow and observing the reactivation.

### Practice
Create a test workflow, deactivate it, and tag it with "auto_resume:true". Run the main workflow manually to observe how it automatically reactivates your test workflow. Adjust the schedule to see how it impacts the reactivation timing.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow ensures your automations are consistently operational, minimizing downtime and enhancing service reliability. This skill adds value to your automation services, potentially attracting more clients and increasing revenue by offering robust, self-healing systems.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
