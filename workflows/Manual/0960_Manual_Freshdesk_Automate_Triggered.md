  ### Explain
This n8n workflow connects to Freshdesk, a customer support platform, to retrieve and manage open support tickets. It triggers manually and fetches tickets marked as "open" with a specific requester email. This helps in organizing and handling customer queries efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Freshdesk account using API credentials.
3. Set the requester email to your desired value.
4. Execute the workflow manually to fetch open tickets.
5. Customize further as needed to fit your support process.

### Practice
Create a test Freshdesk account with dummy support tickets. Use the workflow to fetch these tickets and observe how it manages them. Experiment with different requester emails to see the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient customer support automation services. This can lead to faster ticket resolution, higher customer satisfaction, and potential new clients seeking automation solutions for their support systems.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
