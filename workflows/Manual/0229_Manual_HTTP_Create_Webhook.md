# Manual HTTP Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, httpRequest×3, set×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Note** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "200", content: "## HTTP Request
### This workflow shows the most common use cases of the HTTP request node, and how to handle its output


### Click the `Execute Workflow` button and double click …[truncated]"
4. **Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "986.3743856726365", height: "460.847917534361", content: "## 3. Handle Pagination

5. **Note6** `stickyNote` — width: "680", height: "280", content: "## 2. Data Scraping
### In this example we fetch the titles from the n8n blog using the `HTTP request` node and then we use the `HTML extract` node to pass."
6. **Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "500", height: "280", content: "## 1. Split into items
### In this example, we take the body from an `HTTP Request` node and split it out into items that are easier to manage."
7. **Set** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
8. **HTTP Request - Get Mock Albums** `httpRequest` — url: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums`
9. **HTTP Request - Get Wikipedia Page** `httpRequest` — url: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random`
10. **Item Lists - Create Items from Body** `itemLists` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "body"
11. **HTML Extract - Extract Article Title** `htmlExtract` — options: "[object Object]", sourceData: "binary", extractionValues: "[object Object]"

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
