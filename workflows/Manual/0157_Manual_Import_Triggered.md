# Manual Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, function.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Function**.
  2. **Function** `function` — functionCode: "var date = new Date().toISOString();
var day = new Date().getDay();
const weekday = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to fetch the current date and the day of the week when manually triggered. It uses a Function node to calculate the date and day, then stores these values in a JSON format. This is a simple automation that demonstrates how to manipulate and store date information using JavaScript in n8n.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to timestamp data entries or logs, ensuring that each entry is marked with the exact date and day of the week for accurate record-keeping and reporting.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Function** node with the provided JavaScript code to calculate the date and day.
4. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the output.

### Practice
Create a workflow that logs the current date and day into a file or database each time it runs. Test it by manually triggering the workflow and checking the stored data for accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow equips you with the skills to handle date and time data, a common requirement in automation. This capability can enhance your service offerings, allowing you to build more sophisticated, time-sensitive workflows, thereby attracting more clients and increasing your business value.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
