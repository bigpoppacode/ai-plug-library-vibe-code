  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves the profile information of the "n8n" repository from GitHub. It starts manually when you click 'execute', triggering a request to GitHub to fetch details about the specified repository, such as its owner, description, and other metadata.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to monitor changes in a specific GitHub repository, ensuring they have the latest information for project management or reporting purposes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub account with the appropriate credentials.
3. Click 'execute' to trigger the workflow.
4. Observe the output to see the repository details.
5. Customize the workflow to target different repositories as needed.

### Practice
Create a test workflow to fetch profile data from another GitHub repository. Compare the results and explore how changes in the repository affect the data retrieved by the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer GitHub integration services, enhancing project management capabilities for clients. This can lead to increased service offerings and potential income growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
