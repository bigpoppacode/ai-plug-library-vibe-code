  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stackby×2, manualTrigger, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

  2. **Stackby1** `stackby` — operation: **list**, table: `={{$node["Stackby"].parameter["table"]}}`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves data from a Stackby table and lists its contents. It begins with a manual trigger, sets some initial data (ID and Name), and then interacts with Stackby to list entries from a specified table, effectively allowing you to view and manage data stored in Stackby.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to routinely check and list updates in a project management table stored in Stackby, ensuring they have the latest information for decision-making without manually navigating the Stackby interface.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Stackby account using API credentials.
3. Configure the Stackby node to point to your specific table by setting the correct table name and stack ID.
4. Execute the workflow manually to see the list of entries from your Stackby table.

### Practice
Create a Stackby table with some sample data. Run the workflow to list the data. Modify the table contents, then re-run the workflow to observe how the changes are reflected in the output, reinforcing your understanding of data retrieval.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage and analyze data stored in Stackby, adding value to your services by offering automated data insights to clients. This capability can enhance your service offerings, leading to increased client satisfaction and potential income growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** stackbyApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
