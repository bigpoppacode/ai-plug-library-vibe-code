# Manual Spreadsheetfile Export Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **TableName** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
4. **Postgres** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
5. **Spreadsheet File** `spreadsheetFile` — operation: **toFile**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow exports data from a PostgreSQL database to a CSV file. When the workflow is triggered manually, it retrieves all records from the "booksRead" table in the database, using the table name set in the workflow. The data is then converted into a CSV file, allowing easy sharing or storage.

### Demonstrate
A bookshop owner could use this workflow to export a list of books that customers have read, enabling them to analyze reading trends and preferences for better stock management and marketing strategies.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure your PostgreSQL credentials.
3. Modify the table name in the Set node if needed.
4. Trigger the workflow to export your data.
5. Check the CSV file for the exported data.

### Practice
Create a test PostgreSQL table with sample data, then run the workflow. Verify that the data exports correctly by checking the generated CSV file. Experiment by adding or changing data in the table and re-running the export.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data exports, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can be marketed to businesses needing regular data exports, offering a service that enhances their data management capabilities and potentially increasing your income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
