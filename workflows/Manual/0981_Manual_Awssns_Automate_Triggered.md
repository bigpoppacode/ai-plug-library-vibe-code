# Manual AWSSNS Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, awsSns.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **AWS SNS**.
  2. **AWS SNS** `awsSns` — channel/topic: `n8n-rocks`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends a test message to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic. When manually triggered, it sends a predefined message with a subject to the specified SNS topic, which can then notify subscribers via email, SMS, or other supported protocols.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly test their SNS topic setup, ensuring that notifications are correctly sent to subscribers. This is useful for validating notification systems that alert users about new product launches or system updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your AWS account with the correct credentials.
3. Ensure the SNS topic `n8n-rocks` exists in your AWS account.
4. Manually trigger the workflow to send a test message.
5. Verify that subscribers receive the notification.

### Practice
Create a new SNS topic in AWS and add a few email addresses as subscribers. Use the workflow to send a test notification and confirm that all subscribers receive the message. Modify the message content to see how it changes the notification.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently set up and test notification systems for clients, ensuring reliable communication channels. This skill enhances your automation service offerings, enabling you to attract clients who need robust alert systems, thereby increasing your income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** aws.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
