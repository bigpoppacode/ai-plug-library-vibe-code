  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing a WooCommerce product. When executed, it creates a new product called "n8n Sweatshirt" with a description and price. It then updates the stock quantity for that product to 100. Finally, it retrieves the product details to confirm the changes. This ensures that product information is accurately maintained in the WooCommerce store.

### Demonstrate
A small online retailer could use this workflow to efficiently manage their inventory by automatically updating product details and stock levels, reducing manual errors and saving time.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your WooCommerce account.
3. Modify the product name, description, and price if needed.
4. Set the desired stock quantity.
5. Execute the workflow to create, update, and verify a product in WooCommerce.

### Practice
Create a test product in WooCommerce, then run the workflow to update its stock and verify the changes. Modify the product details in the workflow and observe the updates in WooCommerce.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated inventory management solutions to e-commerce clients, improving their operations and expanding your service offerings, potentially increasing your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
