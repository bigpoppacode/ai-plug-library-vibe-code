# Manual Brandfetch Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Airtable**.
  2. **Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **append**, table: `Table 1`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves a company's logo, icon, and other information using Brandfetch and stores it in an Airtable database. It starts with a manual trigger, fetches the company's data, formats it, and appends the details to a specified table in Airtable.

### Demonstrate
A startup could use this workflow to automatically populate their Airtable database with branding details of potential partners or competitors, saving time on manual research and data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Brandfetch and Airtable credentials.
3. Configure the domain in the Brandfetch node to your target company.
4. Map the desired fields in the Set node.
5. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Create a test Airtable base and run the workflow with different company domains. Observe how the information is fetched and stored. Experiment with adding more fields from Brandfetch to Airtable.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection tasks, making your operations more efficient. It can enhance your service offerings, allowing you to provide automated data enrichment solutions to clients, potentially increasing your income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** brandfetchApi, airtableApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
