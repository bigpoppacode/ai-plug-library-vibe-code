# Manual Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×2, manualTrigger, function.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set1**.
  2. **Set1** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow begins with a manual trigger to execute the process. It uses a function node to create two items with IDs 0 and 1. An IF node checks these IDs; if the ID equals 0, it proceeds to set the value "n8n". If the ID equals 1, it sets the value "nodemation". This workflow can be used to dynamically assign values based on conditions, showcasing basic conditional logic in automation.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to dynamically update or set configuration values based on different environments or conditions, such as switching between different API keys or endpoints based on a simple condition check.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Use a manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Modify the function node to generate conditions relevant to your use case.
4. Customize the Set nodes to assign the values you need.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sets values correctly based on conditions.

### Practice
Create a new workflow that assigns different email templates based on user roles. Use a function node to define roles and an IF node to direct the flow to different Set nodes representing different templates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to build flexible automations that adapt to varying conditions. This skill can expand your service offerings, enabling you to create tailored automation solutions for clients, thereby increasing your value as an automation consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
