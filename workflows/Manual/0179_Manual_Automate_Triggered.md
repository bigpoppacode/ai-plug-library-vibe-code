# Manual Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Summing function**.
  2. **Summing function** `function` — functionCode: "// Code here will run only once, no matter how many input items there are.

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow calculates the total sum of a series of monetary amounts. It begins with a manual trigger, generates mock data with predefined amounts in USD, and then uses a summing function to add all the amounts together, outputting the total sum as a single value.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to automate the process of summing daily sales data, reducing manual calculations and ensuring accuracy in financial reporting.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger to start the process.
3. Create mock data with amounts in USD.
4. Implement the summing function to calculate the total.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it outputs the correct total sum.

### Practice
Create a mock data set with different values and run the workflow. Observe how the summing function calculates the total. Modify values to see how the total changes, ensuring you understand how the function processes the data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate financial calculations, save time on manual tasks, and offer enhanced data processing services to clients. This skill can be leveraged to improve business operations or as a valuable service in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
