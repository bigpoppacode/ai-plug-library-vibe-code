This n8n workflow is designed to automate task management in Microsoft To Do. It starts with a manual trigger to create a new task with a high importance level in a specified task list. After creation, the task is immediately updated to mark it as "in progress." This helps in structuring tasks effectively, ensuring they are prioritized and tracked through their lifecycle.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to quickly add and update tasks during meetings, ensuring tasks are immediately acknowledged and tracked, improving team productivity and task visibility.

### Imitate

2. Connect your Microsoft To Do account.
3. Set the task title and list ID in the "Microsoft To Do" node.
4. Execute the workflow to create and update a task.
5. Customize further as needed for different task attributes.

### Practice

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
