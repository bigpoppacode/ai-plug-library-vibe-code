# Manual Openai Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "600", height: "126", content: "## This is a helper workflow to create 3 CSV files
### Feel free to adapt as needed
### Some mock data from GPT is pinned for convenience"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "394", height: "254", content: "### These 2 nodes fix an issue with BOM bytes in the beginning of the file.
Without them reading the CSV file back becomes tricky"
5. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **chat**, prompt: "[object Object]", model: `gpt-4`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the generation of CSV files with mock user data using OpenAI's GPT-4. It starts with a manual trigger, requests fictional user data from OpenAI, processes the data into JSON, converts it into CSV format, and saves the files locally. The workflow ensures the CSV files are free of Byte Order Mark (BOM) issues, which can complicate reading the files back.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly generate mock data for testing or demo purposes, ensuring that their data processing systems handle CSV files correctly before going live with real data.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI account.
3. Set up the manual trigger to execute the workflow.
4. Test the workflow to generate and save CSV files with mock data.
5. Customize the prompt or data handling as needed.

**Practice:**  
Create a test workflow that generates mock user data with different conditions (e.g., different character names or data fields) and saves it in a CSV file. Experiment with altering JSON structures and observe how it affects the CSV output.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data generation services, which can be invaluable for testing and development purposes. This skill enhances your service offerings and can lead to increased revenue opportunities in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
