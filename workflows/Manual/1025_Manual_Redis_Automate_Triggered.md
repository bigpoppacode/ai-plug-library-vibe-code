# Manual Redis Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, redis.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Redis**.
  2. **Redis** `redis` — operation: **get**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to retrieve data from a Redis database. When executed, the workflow uses a manual trigger to initiate the process. It then connects to a Redis server to retrieve the value associated with a specific key ("hello") from the database. This simple operation can be part of a larger workflow to use, manipulate, or display the retrieved data.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to check the status or value of a configuration setting stored in Redis, which is often used for caching and quick data retrieval in applications. This can be useful for debugging or monitoring purposes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Redis credentials in the workflow.
3. Modify the key parameter if needed to match your Redis database setup.
4. Trigger the workflow manually to test the Redis data retrieval.
5. Observe the retrieved data for verification.

### Practice
Create a simple Redis database with a few key-value pairs. Use the workflow to retrieve different keys and observe how the data is fetched and displayed in n8n. Experiment by changing the key and observing the results.

### WIIFM
Understanding this workflow enables you to integrate Redis into your automation processes, enhancing your ability to manage and retrieve cached data efficiently. This skill can help you offer optimized data management solutions to clients, potentially increasing your service offerings and revenue in the automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** redis.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
