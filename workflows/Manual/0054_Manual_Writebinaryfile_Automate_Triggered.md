# Manual Writebinaryfile Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, writeBinaryFile, moveBinaryData.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Use Default Config**.
  2. **Use Default Config** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow initializes a standup bot by setting default configuration values, converting them to binary data, and writing them to a JSON file. Triggered manually, it configures necessary tokens and URLs for the bot to operate, ensuring it’s ready for communication in a platform like Mattermost.

### Demonstrate
A team using Mattermost for daily standups could use this workflow to automate the setup of their standup bot, ensuring it’s configured correctly each time they need to reset or deploy it, saving time and reducing manual errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Fill in your specific Mattermost tokens and URLs in the "Use Default Config" node.
3. Trigger the workflow manually to execute the configuration setup.
4. Verify the JSON file is correctly written with your configuration.

### Practice
Create a test configuration in an n8n workflow and run it. Check if the JSON file updates correctly. Change some values and rerun to observe the changes being correctly applied.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to efficiently set up communication bots for clients, streamlining team operations and enhancing productivity. This expertise can be monetized as a service, offering bot configurations and management as part of your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
