  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Microsoft Teams2**.
  2. **Microsoft Teams2** `microsoftTeams` — resource: **channelMessage**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate communication within Microsoft Teams. When manually triggered, it creates a channel in a specified team, updates the channel's name, and sends a text message "n8n rocks!" to that channel. This ensures that team members are informed and engaged with minimal manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to streamline project updates, automatically creating a new channel for each project phase, updating the channel name as needed, and notifying the team with an initial message.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Connect your Microsoft Teams account.
3. Identify the team ID and channel ID you want to automate.
4. Customize the message and channel name as needed.
5. Trigger the workflow to test its execution.

### Practice
Create a new Microsoft Teams channel using this workflow and customize the message to announce a team meeting. Observe how the workflow updates the channel and sends the message, then modify the workflow to change the message content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance team communication, reducing manual tasks and improving efficiency. As a consultant, offering such automation can attract clients looking to streamline their internal processes, leading to potential service upsells and recurring revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** microsoftTeamsOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
