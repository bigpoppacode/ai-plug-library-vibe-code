# Manual Zendesk Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Zendesk**.
  2. **Zendesk** `zendesk` — operation: **getAll**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves all unassigned pending tickets from Zendesk and sends a Slack message listing these tickets. It uses a manual trigger or a scheduled time to start, fetches the ticket data from Zendesk, formats the information into a message using a function node, and then posts the message to a specified Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A customer support manager could use this workflow to receive daily updates on unassigned tickets, ensuring that no customer inquiries are overlooked and allowing the team to prioritize ticket handling efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Zendesk and Slack accounts.
3. Set up the schedule in the Cron node or use the manual trigger to execute.
4. Customize the Slack channel and Zendesk query to fit your needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends the correct ticket information.

### Practice
Create a test Zendesk account with a few tickets, then run the workflow. Observe how the tickets are formatted and sent to Slack. Try modifying the query to filter tickets differently and see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated customer support monitoring services, improving response times and customer satisfaction. This can enhance your service portfolio and potentially increase client engagement and revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, zendeskApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
