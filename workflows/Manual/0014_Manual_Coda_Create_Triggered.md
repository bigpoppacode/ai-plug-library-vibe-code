  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of inserting data into a Coda table. It starts with a manual trigger, sets specific data for three columns using the Set node, and then sends this data to a specified Coda document and table. This allows users to easily add structured data to their Coda tables with a single workflow execution.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly add new entries to a Coda table, such as logging daily sales or updating inventory levels, without manually entering data each time.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the Coda node with your document and table ID.
3. Adjust the Set node to match your desired column names and values.
4. Manually trigger the workflow to test data insertion into Coda.

### Practice
Create a test Coda document with a table. Run the workflow to insert new rows with sample data. Modify the data in the Set node and observe how it updates in Coda. Experiment by adding more columns and data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data entry into Coda, saving time and reducing errors. As a consultant, you can offer this automation to clients looking to streamline data management, expanding your service offerings and increasing revenue.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
