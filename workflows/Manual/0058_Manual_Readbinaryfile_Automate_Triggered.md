# Manual Readbinaryfile Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Convert to JSON**.
  2. **Convert to JSON** `moveBinaryData` — options: "[object Object]", sourceKey: "config"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow reads a configuration file for a standup bot. When executed manually, it retrieves a JSON configuration from a specified file path and converts it from binary to JSON format. This setup is crucial for ensuring the bot has the necessary settings to operate correctly.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to load and update configuration settings for a standup bot in a team collaboration tool, ensuring the bot has the latest settings without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect the file path to your configuration file in the "Read Config File" node.
3. Ensure the "Convert to JSON" node is set to convert the data correctly.
4. Click 'execute' to test the workflow and ensure the JSON is correctly read and transformed.

### Practice
Create a sample JSON file with mock configuration data. Use this workflow to read and convert the file, then verify the output JSON to ensure it matches the original data structure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate the management of configuration files, reducing manual errors and ensuring your systems are always running with the correct settings. This skill can enhance your service offerings in automation, improving client satisfaction and retention.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
