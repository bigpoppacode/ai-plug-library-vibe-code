It creates a new contact with given and family names "n8n", updates the contact's company information, and retrieves the updated contact details, including organizational data. It ensures contact details are current and correctly stored.

A business owner could use this workflow to automate the process of updating team members' contact details in Google Contacts, ensuring all team members have the latest company information without manual updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Contacts account.
3. Customize the given and family names in the "Google Contacts" node.
4. Adjust the company details in the "Google Contacts1" node as needed.
5. Execute the workflow to test the creation, update, and retrieval process.

### Practice
Create a test contact in your Google Contacts and run the workflow. Modify the company information in the workflow and observe how the contact details are updated and retrieved. Test with different contact names and company details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage contact information, reducing manual entry errors and saving time. Offering this as a service can attract clients who need automated solutions for managing large contact databases, potentially increasing your revenue.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
