# Manual Code Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Midjourney Generator** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.piapi.ai/api/v1/task`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the generation of 3D figurine images using Midjourney and GPT-4o-Image APIs. When triggered, it sends a request to Midjourney to create an image based on a specified prompt. Once the image is generated, the workflow retrieves the image URL, verifies its completion, and uses GPT-4o-Image to convert the image into orthographic views (front, side, back), creating a detailed 3D figurine sheet.

### Demonstrate
A toy designer could use this workflow to quickly visualize and iterate on new character designs, saving time and resources by automating the creation of 3D model sheets for review and presentation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up API keys for Midjourney and GPT-4o-Image.
3. Customize the image prompt to fit your design needs.
4. Trigger the workflow manually to test the image generation and processing.
5. Review the generated 3D views to ensure they meet your expectations.

### Practice
Create a new design prompt and run the workflow. Analyze the generated 3D views and adjust the prompt parameters to see how changes affect the output. This helps in understanding the impact of different design inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated 3D design visualization services, enhancing your design capabilities and attracting clients in creative industries. This can increase your service offerings and generate additional income streams in an AI-driven design business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
