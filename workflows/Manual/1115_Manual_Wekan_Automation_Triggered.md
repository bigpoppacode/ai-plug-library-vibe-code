  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management using Wekan, a kanban board application. It starts with a manual trigger, creates a new board titled "Documentation," and adds two lists: "To Do" and "Done." It then creates a card titled "Document Wekan node" in the "To Do" list, and finally updates the card to move it to the "Done" list, simulating a task completion process.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to automate the setup of new project boards, ensuring a consistent structure with predefined lists and tasks, saving time on manual board configuration.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Wekan credentials in n8n.
3. Customize board, list, and card titles as needed.
4. Execute the workflow to test its functionality and observe the updates in Wekan.

### Practice
Create a new Wekan board and lists manually, then use this workflow to automate moving a task from "To Do" to "Done." Experiment with different board setups and card titles to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline project management tasks, reducing setup time and ensuring consistency across projects. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase your revenue in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** wekanApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
