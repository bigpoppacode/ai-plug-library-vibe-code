# Manual OpenWeatherMap Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, openWeatherMap.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **OpenWeatherMap**.
  2. **OpenWeatherMap** `openWeatherMap` — cityName: "berlin,de"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves the current weather data for Berlin, Germany, using the OpenWeatherMap API. It starts when manually triggered and fetches weather information like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. This setup is ideal for getting real-time weather updates.

### Demonstrate
A travel agency could use this workflow to update their website with real-time weather information for popular destinations, providing customers with up-to-date weather conditions to help them plan their trips effectively.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Set up your OpenWeatherMap API credentials.
3. Use the manual trigger to execute the workflow.
4. Customize the city name or add more nodes to process the data further.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and displays the weather data correctly.

### Practice
Create a new workflow that fetches weather data for your current location. Change the city name in the OpenWeatherMap node and observe the results. Experiment with additional nodes to send the data to an email or display it on a dashboard.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer weather data integrations to clients, enhancing their websites or applications with real-time data. This can expand your service offerings and attract clients interested in data-driven features, boosting your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openWeatherMapApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
