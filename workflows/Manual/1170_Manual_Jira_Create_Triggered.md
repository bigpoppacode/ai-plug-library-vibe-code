  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to create a new issue in Jira. It starts manually when you click 'execute', which triggers the creation of a Jira issue with the summary "Firewall on fire" and a specified issue type. This helps in automating the process of logging incidents or tasks directly into Jira, ensuring they are tracked and managed efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly log IT incidents, like a firewall issue, directly into Jira. It streamlines the reporting process, ensures incidents are recorded promptly, and helps maintain a clear log for follow-up actions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Configure your Jira credentials in the node.
3. Customize the summary and issue type fields if needed.
4. Test the workflow by clicking 'execute' to ensure an issue is created in Jira.
5. Adjust the project field to match your Jira setup.

### Practice
Create a test issue in Jira using this workflow. Modify the summary to reflect different incidents and observe how it logs them. This helps in understanding how to customize the workflow for various reporting needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage incident reporting for clients, enhancing your service offerings. It can lead to increased client satisfaction and retention, as well as potential upselling opportunities in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
