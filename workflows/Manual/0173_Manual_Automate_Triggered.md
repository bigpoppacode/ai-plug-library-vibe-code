# Manual Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Summing function**.
  2. **Summing function** `function` — functionCode: "// Code here will run only once, no matter how many input items there are.

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow calculates the total sum of specified amounts in USD from a list of mock data. It begins with a manual trigger, generates a set of mock data with different USD amounts, and then uses a function to sum these amounts, returning the total as a JSON object.

### Demonstrate
A freelance consultant could use this workflow to quickly aggregate financial data from multiple sources or transactions, ensuring an accurate total for reporting or invoicing purposes without manual calculation errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Use the manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Modify the mock data to reflect your own financial data.
4. Execute the workflow to get the total sum of your specified amounts.

### Practice
Create a new set of mock data with varying amounts and execute the workflow. Verify the accuracy of the summing function by manually calculating the total and comparing it to the workflow's output.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can streamline financial data aggregation tasks, improving accuracy and efficiency. This skill can enhance your service offerings, allowing you to manage financial data for clients, thus increasing your value and potential income in automation consultancy.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
