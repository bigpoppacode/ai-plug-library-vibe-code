# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1200", height: "520"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "460", height: "180"
5. **Scrape Leads** `httpRequest` — url: `=`
6. **Filter leads without email** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Save Leads in database** `airtable` — operation: **create**, table: `[object Object]`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow automates lead generation. It scrapes leads from a specified source, filters out entries without email addresses, enriches the data with additional fields, and then saves the valid leads into an Airtable database. This process ensures that only complete and usable leads are stored for future marketing or sales activities.

- **Demonstrate**: A startup could use this workflow to automatically gather and validate leads from a web form or third-party service, ensuring their sales team only works with leads that have email addresses, thus optimizing their outreach efforts.

- **Imitate**: 
  1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
  2. Set the source URL in the "Scrape Leads" node.
  3. Configure the Airtable node with your database credentials.
  4. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and processes leads correctly.
  5. Adjust field mappings as needed in the "Edit Fields" step.

- **Practice**: Create a mock Airtable base and add some test data. Run the workflow to scrape and filter leads, then check the Airtable base to ensure only valid leads with emails are saved. Modify some test entries to see how the workflow handles incomplete data.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated lead management services, enhancing marketing efficiency for clients, and providing a scalable solution that can be monetized as a recurring service, thereby increasing your business's revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableTokenApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
