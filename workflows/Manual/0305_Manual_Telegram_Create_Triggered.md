# Manual Telegram Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, telegram, uproc.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **uProc**.
  2. **uProc** `uproc` — url: `https://n8n.io`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow captures a screenshot of a specified website using the uProc service and sends the screenshot to a Telegram channel. It starts with a manual trigger, uses uProc to generate the screenshot, and then sends the screenshot to a Telegram chat.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to automate the process of capturing and sharing website updates with a team quickly. For example, a marketing team could use it to instantly share screenshots of their website's homepage after a major update.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your uProc and Telegram accounts.
3. Set the URL in the uProc node to the desired website.
4. Add your Telegram chat ID to the Telegram node.
5. Execute the workflow to capture and send the screenshot.

### Practice
Create a test workflow using a different website URL. Run it to see how the screenshot is captured and sent. Experiment by changing the Telegram chat ID to send the screenshot to different channels or users.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer automated monitoring and reporting services. This can be valuable for clients needing regular updates or documentation of website changes, potentially increasing your service offerings and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, uprocApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
