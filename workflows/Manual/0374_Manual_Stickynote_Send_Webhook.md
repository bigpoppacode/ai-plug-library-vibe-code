# Manual Stickynote Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×3, stickyNote×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "671", height: "328"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "671", height: "232"
5. **Fetch API details** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/session`
6. **Get mailboxes** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/api/`
7. **Format results** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", include: "none", options: "[object Object]"
8. **Get unread messages** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/api/`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of checking for unread emails in a Fastmail account. It starts by fetching API session details, retrieves mailbox information, formats the results to extract necessary IDs, and finally, queries for unread messages in the inbox. This ensures users can automate email management tasks, like notifications or further processing of unread emails.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automate checking for unread emails and trigger notifications or task creation in a project management tool whenever a new email arrives, ensuring they never miss important communications.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up Fastmail credentials in the HTTP Request nodes. 3. Execute the workflow manually to test connectivity and functionality. 4. Adjust any node parameters to fit your specific email management needs, like filtering by sender or subject.

- **Practice:** Create a simple test by sending yourself a few emails and executing the workflow. Observe how it retrieves unread messages and consider adding a node to log these emails to a Google Sheet or send a Slack notification.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email management services, helping clients streamline communications, improve response times, and maintain organized records. This can expand your service offerings, leading to increased client satisfaction and potential revenue growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
