# Manual Emailsend Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Send Email** `emailSend` — text: "This is a message to demonstrate the n8n Send Email workflow!", options: "[object Object]", subject: "n8n rocks!"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to send an email when manually triggered. It consists of two main parts: a trigger node that starts the workflow when executed, and an email node that sends a predefined email message. This email contains a simple message with the subject "n8n rocks!" and is sent from a specified email address to a recipient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly send a test email to verify their email server settings or to send a simple notification to themselves or a team member, ensuring their email infrastructure is correctly configured.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up SMTP credentials in the email node.
3. Adjust the recipient and sender email addresses.
4. Manually trigger the workflow by clicking 'Execute' to send the email.
5. Verify the email is received correctly.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow but customize the email content and subject to send a personalized message to a friend or colleague. Test it by executing the workflow and confirming delivery.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to quickly set up automated email notifications, a fundamental skill for offering automation services. By ensuring reliable email delivery, you enhance your credibility and can offer this as a service to clients, potentially generating income in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** smtp.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
