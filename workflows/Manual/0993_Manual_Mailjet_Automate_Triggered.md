  2. **Mailjet** `mailjet` — text: "This is a test message", subject: "Sample Subject", toEmail: "user2@example.com"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends an email using Mailjet. It is triggered manually and consists of two steps: a manual trigger and a Mailjet node. When executed, it sends an email with the subject "Sample Subject" and the message "This is a test message" to the specified recipient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly test their email configuration and ensure that emails are being sent correctly from their system before deploying more complex email workflows.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Mailjet account.
3. Set up the "Mailjet" node with your desired email content and recipient.
4. Click "Execute" to test the email sending functionality.
5. Verify the email was received.

### Practice
Create a new workflow that sends an email to yourself with a custom message. Use the manual trigger to send the email and ensure it arrives in your inbox. Adjust the email content and recipient to see how the workflow handles changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to ensure reliable email communications, a critical component of many business operations. It can help you offer email automation services, enhancing your service offerings and potentially increasing your income in the automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
