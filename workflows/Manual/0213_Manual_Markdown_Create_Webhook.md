# Manual Markdown Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **GetTimesheetRecords**.
  2. **GetTimesheetRecords** `function` — functionCode: "return [{UserName: "User 1 - Lead Programmer",
         UserAvatar: "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?d=robohash&s=32",
         TaskTitle: "Admin",
         date: "2022-05-31T00:0…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow generates a timesheet report from predefined records. It retrieves timesheet data, sorts it, and formats it into a markdown report. The workflow then converts the markdown to HTML, attaches the report to an email, and prepares it for sending. The email functionality is currently disabled.

### Demonstrate
A company can use this workflow to automatically generate weekly timesheet reports for team leads, helping them track project hours and tasks efficiently without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Modify the `GetTimesheetRecords` function to fetch real data.
3. Enable and configure the `Send Email` node with SMTP credentials.
4. Test the workflow by executing it manually and reviewing the generated report.

### Practice
Create a test dataset with timesheet entries. Run the workflow to generate a report. Check the HTML output to ensure it accurately reflects the data. Experiment by adding new tasks or users to see how the report adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline reporting processes, saving time and reducing errors. It enables you to offer automated reporting solutions to clients, enhancing your service portfolio and potentially increasing your revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** smtp.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
