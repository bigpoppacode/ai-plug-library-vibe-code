# Manual FTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using ftp×2, manualTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://n8n.io/n8n-logo.png`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading an image from a URL and uploading it to an FTP server. It starts by manually triggering the process, downloading the n8n logo from a specified URL, and then uploading this file to a specified path on an FTP server. After uploading, it lists the files in the FTP directory to confirm the upload.

### Demonstrate
A web developer might use this workflow to automate the process of updating images on a server, ensuring the latest versions are always available without manual intervention, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and import the workflow.
2. Configure the FTP node with your server credentials.
3. Modify the URL in the HTTP Request node to point to your desired file.
4. Adjust the FTP path as needed.
5. Execute the workflow to test the download and upload process.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to download a file from a different URL and upload it to a separate FTP directory. Test the workflow by checking the FTP server to ensure the file appears in the correct location.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline your file management processes, reduce manual upload errors, and save you time. For automation businesses, offering this service can attract clients needing efficient file handling solutions, boosting your income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** ftp.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
