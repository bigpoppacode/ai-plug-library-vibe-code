  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to check if a company exists in a database. It starts manually when executed, creates a company item with the name "Killia Technologies" and country "Spain," and then uses an API to search for this company by name and country. The workflow concludes with a conditional check to see if the company was found, based on the API response.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to verify the existence of client companies in a database before proceeding with further business development or partnership discussions. This ensures that resources are only allocated to verified entities.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Modify the company and country values in the "Create Company Item" node.
4. Connect your API credentials to the "Get Company by Name" node.
5. Test the workflow to check the existence of companies based on your inputs.

### Practice
Create a test workflow using a mock database or API that checks the existence of different companies. Use various company names and countries to see how the workflow behaves with different inputs and verify the conditional logic.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow equips you to offer company verification services, adding value to your client offerings. It can help you build trust with clients by ensuring accurate and up-to-date business information, potentially leading to increased customer satisfaction and revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** uprocApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
