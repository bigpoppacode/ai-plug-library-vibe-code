  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to read and process RSS feeds. When manually triggered, it connects to the specified RSS feed URL (`https://failedmachine.com/rss/`) and retrieves the latest updates or articles from the feed. This workflow is useful for automatically collecting and reviewing new content from a website or blog.

### Demonstrate
A content manager could use this workflow to monitor updates on industry-related blogs. By regularly checking RSS feeds, they can stay informed about the latest trends and news, allowing them to curate content for their audience efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Set up a manual trigger for testing purposes.
3. Configure the RSS Feed Read node with your desired RSS feed URL.
4. Execute the workflow to see how it retrieves and displays the feed data.
5. Adjust the setup to automate content monitoring as needed.

### Practice
Create a workflow that reads an RSS feed from a favorite blog or news site. Execute it manually and note the output. Try changing the URL to see how the workflow handles different feeds and formats.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate content aggregation, saving you time and keeping you up-to-date with industry trends. This skill can be valuable for digital marketers, content creators, and businesses looking to enhance their content strategy, potentially leading to new client opportunities and revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
