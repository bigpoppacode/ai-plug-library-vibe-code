  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test Workflow"**.
  2. **Note** `stickyNote` — width: "300", height: "220", content: "## About the very quick quickstart workflow

This is an incomplete workflow, used in the [very quick quickstart](https://docs.n8n.io//try-it-out/quickstart/) tutorial."
3. **Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "300", content: "**Get fake sample data**"
4. **Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "300", content: "**Extract data and prepare it for use in the next node**"
5. **When clicking "Test Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
6. **Customer Datastore** `n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore` — operation: **getAllPeople**
7. **Edit Fields1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow retrieves a list of people from a customer data source and formats the data for further processing. It begins with a manual trigger that fetches all customer data, which is then processed to extract specific fields like customer ID, name, and description. This setup is part of an introductory tutorial for n8n, showcasing how to handle data extraction and preparation.
  
- **Demonstrate**: A business consultant might use this workflow to quickly pull and format customer data for analysis or reporting. It's particularly useful for preparing datasets for presentations or further automation processes.

- **Imitate**: To apply this workflow, import it into your n8n environment. Set up a manual trigger to start the workflow, and ensure your customer datastore is connected. Customize the fields in the "Set" node to match the data you need to extract and format.

- **Practice**: Create a mock customer database in n8n and run the workflow to see how it extracts and formats data. Modify the "Set" node to include additional fields or change the formatting to see how it affects the output.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow equips you to efficiently handle customer data, a crucial skill for automating business processes. This ability can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase revenue in the automation market.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
