# Manual HTTP Monitor Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function×3, manualTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Combine all data**.
  2. **Combine all data** `function` — functionCode: "const allData = []

let counter = 0;
do {
  try {
    const items = $items("HTTP Request", 0, counter).map(item => item.json.results);
                    
    const aja = items[0]…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving and combining data from an API that supports pagination, such as HubSpot's contacts API. It repeatedly makes HTTP requests to gather all pages of data, checks for additional pages, and combines the results into a single dataset for further processing.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to collect all customer contact data from their CRM for a marketing campaign, ensuring they have the most up-to-date and complete information.

- **Imitate:** 1) Import the workflow into your n8n instance. 2) Connect your API credentials. 3) Set the initial API endpoint in the "Config URL" node. 4) Test the workflow to ensure it collects and combines all data pages correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a test API endpoint with pagination and use this workflow to collect and combine data from it. Modify the endpoint URL and adjust the pagination logic if necessary, then verify the combined output.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection from APIs with pagination, saving time and improving data accuracy. This skill is valuable for offering data integration services, expanding your automation capabilities, and attracting clients who need efficient data management solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
