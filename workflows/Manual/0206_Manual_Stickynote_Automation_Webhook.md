# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, manualTrigger, function.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Note1**.
  2. **Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "320", height: "360", content: "## Transformation
This is where the magic happens. Incoming files are split up into individual items, each with a single binary data object under the `data` key."
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow downloads a zip file containing multiple files, decompresses it, and then processes each file individually. It splits the binary data from the decompressed files into separate items, each containing a single binary data object. This setup is useful for processing files like images or documents one by one.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to automate the processing of multiple image files received via email or FTP. For example, an e-commerce company could use it to handle product images, resizing or categorizing each image automatically after upload.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a trigger (e.g., manual or schedule).
3. Ensure the HTTP Request node points to the correct URL for your zip file.
4. Connect nodes: Download → Decompress → Split.
5. Test with a sample zip file to ensure files are processed correctly.

### Practice
Create a test zip file with a few text documents. Run the workflow to see how it processes each document individually. Modify the workflow to extract specific data from each document (e.g., metadata).

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated file processing solutions to clients, such as categorizing or converting files. This can enhance your service offerings, leading to more clients and potential upsell opportunities in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
