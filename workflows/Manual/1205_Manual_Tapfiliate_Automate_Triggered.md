  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating and updating affiliate information in Tapfiliate. It starts with a manual trigger, creates a new affiliate using predefined details, adds metadata to this affiliate, and then associates the affiliate with a specific program. This ensures that all affiliate data is structured and linked to the correct program for effective tracking and management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow when onboarding new affiliates to their program. By automating data entry and association, it reduces manual errors and saves time, ensuring that new affiliates are set up correctly and efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Tapfiliate account using API credentials.
3. Customize the affiliate's details (email, first name, last name).
4. Adjust the program ID and metadata as needed.
5. Test by manually triggering the workflow to ensure affiliates are correctly added and updated.

### Practice
Create a test Tapfiliate account and use this workflow to add a few test affiliates. Modify the metadata and program ID to see how changes affect the workflow. Verify that each affiliate's data is correctly reflected in Tapfiliate.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage affiliate programs, reducing administrative workload and improving accuracy. This capability can be offered as a service to businesses looking to streamline their affiliate onboarding process, potentially increasing your client base and revenue in the automation sector.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
