  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile_banner.json`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow updates a Twitter profile banner with images of new followers. It fetches the latest followers' profile pictures, processes these images by resizing and cropping, and then combines them with a background image. Finally, it updates the Twitter profile banner with the new composite image.

### Demonstrate
A social media manager could use this workflow to keep their Twitter profile visually dynamic by regularly updating the profile banner with the latest followers' images, enhancing engagement and personalization.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Twitter account using OAuth credentials.
3. Set your Twitter user ID and background image URL.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it updates your Twitter banner correctly.

### Practice
Create a mock Twitter account and run the workflow. Observe how the profile banner updates with new follower images. Experiment by changing the background image or resizing parameters to see the impact.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer dynamic social media branding services. By automating profile updates, you can enhance client engagement and brand presence, potentially increasing customer loyalty and opening up new revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, oAuth1Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
