# Manual Webhook Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, netsuite, webhook.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/249328cc-587a-4269-b266-96fe60cfaeb9`
4. **NetSuite** `netsuite` — operation: **runSuiteQL**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to interact with NetSuite, a cloud business software suite. It starts with a manual trigger or a webhook call, which triggers a SuiteQL query in NetSuite. SuiteQL is a query language used to extract and manipulate data within the NetSuite platform. Essentially, this workflow allows you to pull specific data from NetSuite when a manual test is executed or when an external HTTP request is received via the webhook.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to retrieve real-time sales data from NetSuite when a specific event occurs, such as the end of a sales period, enabling timely decision-making based on the most current data.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your NetSuite account credentials.
3. Set up the webhook URL in your external system to trigger the workflow.
4. Customize the SuiteQL query to fit your data retrieval needs.
5. Test the workflow by triggering it manually or via the webhook.

### Practice
Create a simple test in NetSuite to query customer data. Use this workflow to pull that data into n8n when you trigger the workflow manually or via the webhook. Check and modify the SuiteQL query to understand how it affects the data output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer NetSuite integration services, allowing businesses to automate data retrieval and reporting. This skill can significantly enhance your service offerings, helping you attract clients who rely on NetSuite for their business operations.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** netsuite.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
