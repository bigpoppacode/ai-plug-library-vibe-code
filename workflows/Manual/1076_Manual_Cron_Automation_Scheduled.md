# Manual Cron Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to automate the deletion of records from a MySQL database table that are older than 30 days. Using a Cron node, it triggers daily at 7 AM to execute a SQL query that removes outdated entries, helping to maintain a lean and efficient database by purging unnecessary data.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to regularly clean up a database of completed transactions, ensuring that only recent records are kept for performance optimization and compliance with data retention policies.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Connect your MySQL database credentials.
  3. Adjust the SQL query to match your specific table and date conditions.
  4. Set the Cron node to your desired schedule.
  5. Test the workflow to ensure it deletes the correct records.

- **Practice:** Create a test MySQL table with sample data including timestamps. Run the workflow to see how it deletes old records. Modify the time interval in the SQL query to see how it affects the deletion process.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer database maintenance services to clients, ensuring their systems run smoothly and efficiently. This can lead to recurring income from businesses that need regular data management and optimization solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mySql.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
