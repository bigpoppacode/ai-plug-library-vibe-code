  ### Explain
This workflow in n8n automates the creation and updating of a WordPress post. When you manually trigger the workflow, it first creates a new post with a preset title "created from n8n." Then, it updates this post by adding specific content, stating "This post was created using the n8n workflow." The process ensures that posts are both created and updated automatically.

### Demonstrate
A blogger could use this workflow to automate content updates on their WordPress site, saving time on manual edits and ensuring consistency across published posts.

### Imitate
1. Import this workflow into n8n.
2. Link your WordPress account credentials.
3. Manually trigger the workflow to create and update a post.
4. Customize the title and content fields to suit your needs.
5. Test to ensure the post is created and updated as expected.

### Practice
Create a test post on your WordPress site using this workflow. Observe how the post is updated automatically. Try modifying the content update step to change the message and see the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content management on WordPress, saving time and increasing efficiency. It can help you offer automation services to bloggers and businesses, enhancing your service portfolio and income potential.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
