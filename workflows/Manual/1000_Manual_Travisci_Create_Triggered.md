# Manual TravisCI Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, travisCi.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **TravisCI**.
  2. **TravisCI** `travisCi` — operation: **trigger**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to trigger a build process on TravisCI, a continuous integration service. It starts with a manual trigger node that, when executed, initiates a TravisCI node. This node sends a request to TravisCI to start a build for a specified repository and branch, automating the deployment and testing process for software projects.

### Demonstrate
A software development team might use this workflow to automate their deployment pipeline, ensuring that new code changes are automatically built and tested in TravisCI whenever they decide to execute the workflow, thus maintaining code quality and deployment efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your TravisCI account by setting up the necessary credentials.
3. Specify the repository slug and branch in the TravisCI node parameters.
4. Execute the workflow manually to trigger a build in TravisCI.
5. Verify that the build process starts as expected.

### Practice
Create a test repository on GitHub and connect it to TravisCI. Use this workflow to trigger a build manually. Observe how the build status updates in TravisCI and experiment by making code changes to see the automation in action.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer CI/CD automation services, enhancing software development efficiency for clients. This can lead to increased reliability in software delivery, attracting clients looking for streamlined deployment processes, and potentially boosting your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** travisCiApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
