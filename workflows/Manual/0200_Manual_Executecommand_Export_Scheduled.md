# Manual Executecommand Export Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using executeCommand×5, manualTrigger, cron.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the backup of GitLab workflows and credentials. It is triggered either manually or by a scheduled cron job four times daily. The workflow exports the workflows and credentials to specified directories, commits these changes with a timestamp to a Git repository, and pushes the updates, ensuring regular backups and version control.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer could use this workflow to regularly back up their automation workflows and credentials, ensuring they have a secure and up-to-date version of their projects, ready to restore or share if needed.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect to your Git repository.
3. Customize the export paths in the commands.
4. Set up the cron trigger to your desired schedule.
5. Test the workflow manually to ensure backups are created and pushed correctly.

**Practice**  
Set up a similar workflow to back up a different type of data or another application. Test it with a small dataset to ensure it functions correctly, and modify the cron schedule to see how it affects the backup frequency.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can help you provide backup and version control solutions to clients, ensuring their data is secure and recoverable. This skill can enhance your service offerings and potentially increase your income as a consultant in the automation and data management space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
