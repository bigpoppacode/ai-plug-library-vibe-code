# Manual SIGNL4 Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, signl4.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **SIGNL4**.
  2. **SIGNL4** `signl4` — message: "This is a test alert sent from n8n to SIGNL4", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends a test alert to SIGNL4, a service used for sending critical alerts to teams. When you manually trigger the workflow, it sends a predefined message with a title to the SIGNL4 app, helping teams receive immediate notifications for important events.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to test their alert system, ensuring that their team receives timely notifications for critical system outages or security breaches, enhancing their response time and minimizing downtime.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your SIGNL4 account by adding your SIGNL4 API credentials.
3. Customize the message and title fields if needed.
4. Manually trigger the workflow to test the alert.
5. Verify that the alert is received on your SIGNL4 app.

### Practice
Set up a test scenario where you simulate an important event, like a server going down. Trigger the workflow to see how quickly the alert is delivered to your team through SIGNL4. Adjust the message details to suit your specific alerting needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer reliable alerting solutions to clients, ensuring they can respond swiftly to critical issues. This capability can enhance your service offerings, improve client satisfaction, and potentially lead to increased revenue from automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** signl4Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
