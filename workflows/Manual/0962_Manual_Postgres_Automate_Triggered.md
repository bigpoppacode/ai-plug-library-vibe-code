# Manual Postgres Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Postgres**.
  2. **Postgres** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to manually execute a query on a Postgres database. When triggered, it runs a predefined SQL query (`SELECT * from sometable;`) to fetch all records from a specified table. This setup is useful for retrieving data from a database without needing to manually log into the database interface.

### Demonstrate
A business analyst could use this workflow to quickly pull data from a Postgres database for analysis, ensuring they have the latest information for decision-making without needing direct database access or SQL expertise.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Postgres credentials in n8n.
3. Adjust the SQL query to match your database needs.
4. Trigger the workflow by clicking 'Execute'.
5. Review the output to ensure data retrieval.

### Practice
Create a simple table in your Postgres database and populate it with sample data. Use this workflow to execute a query that retrieves data from this table. Modify the query to filter or sort the data and observe the changes in the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer data retrieval services, helping clients access and analyze their database information efficiently. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new customers, and increase your income as part of an AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
