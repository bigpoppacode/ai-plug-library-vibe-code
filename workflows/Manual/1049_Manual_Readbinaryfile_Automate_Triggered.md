# Manual Readbinaryfile Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Read Binary File**.
  2. **Read Binary File** `readBinaryFile` — filePath: "/data/sample_spreadsheet.csv"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading data from a CSV file. When manually triggered, it reads the content of a specified CSV file located at "/data/sample_spreadsheet.csv". The data is then processed by the "Spreadsheet File" node, which can further manipulate or store the data, such as converting it into a different format or uploading it to another service.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the process of importing sales data from a CSV file into their CRM system, ensuring that their records are always up-to-date without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Set the file path in the "Read Binary File" node to your desired CSV file location.
3. Connect the "Spreadsheet File" node to process or store the data as needed.
4. Execute the workflow manually to test its functionality.

### Practice
Create a sample CSV file with dummy data, place it in the specified file path, and run the workflow. Observe how the data is read and processed, and try modifying the file to see how changes are handled.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you efficiently manage data imports, saving time and reducing errors. This capability can be offered as a service to clients, enhancing your automation business and increasing your revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
