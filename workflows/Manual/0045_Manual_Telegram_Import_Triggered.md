# Manual Telegram Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, functionItem, uproc.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Certificate  has  expired?**.
  2. **Certificate  has  expired?** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow checks if an SSL certificate for a specified domain has expired. It manually triggers the process, sets the domain, retrieves the SSL certificate status, checks if it's expired, and sends a Telegram alert if the certificate is no longer valid.

- **Demonstrate**: A web hosting company could use this workflow to monitor clients' SSL certificates, ensuring they remain valid. This helps prevent website downtime and maintains security standards, thus improving customer satisfaction and trust.

- **Imitate**: 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up a manual trigger to initiate the process. 3. Define the domain in the "Create Domain Item" node. 4. Connect your uProc and Telegram accounts. 5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends alerts for expired certificates.

- **Practice**: Create a test domain entry with an expired certificate in your workflow. Run the workflow to observe how it detects the expiration and sends a notification. Adjust the domain to a valid one and test again to see how it behaves.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can help you offer SSL monitoring services to clients, safeguarding their online presence. This adds value to your offerings, helping you attract more clients and generate recurring revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** uprocApi, telegramApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
