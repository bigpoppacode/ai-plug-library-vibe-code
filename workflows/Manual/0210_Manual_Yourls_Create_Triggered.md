  ### Explain
This n8n workflow creates a short URL from a long URL using YOURLS (Your Own URL Shortener) and retrieves statistics for that shortened URL. It starts manually, shortens a specified URL, and then fetches analytics data, such as the number of clicks, to help track its performance.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to shorten URLs for marketing campaigns and track how many people click on their links, helping them measure the effectiveness of their online promotions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your YOURLS account to n8n.
3. Customize the URL you want to shorten within the workflow.
4. Execute the workflow to generate the short URL and fetch its stats.
5. Monitor the analytics to track engagement.

### Practice
Create a test URL using the workflow and share it with a few friends or colleagues. Check the statistics to see the number of clicks and verify the data updates as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you enhance your marketing strategies by efficiently tracking URL performance. This skill can attract clients looking for reliable analytics solutions, allowing you to expand your automation services and increase revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
