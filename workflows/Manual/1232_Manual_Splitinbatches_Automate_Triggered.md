# Manual Splitinbatches Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, function, splitInBatches.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set**.
  2. **Set** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to execute a loop 10 times, processing each iteration individually. It uses a Function node to create 10 items and a SplitInBatches node to handle them one at a time. An IF node checks if the current iteration index equals 5. If true, it triggers a Set node to output a message "Loop Ended," signaling the end of the loop.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to process a list of tasks sequentially, such as sending emails or processing data entries, ensuring each task is handled individually without overwhelming the system.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Function node to generate the desired number of items.
3. Configure the SplitInBatches node to handle each item one by one.
4. Use the IF node to define a condition for special handling.
5. Test the workflow to verify it executes as expected.

### Practice
Create a workflow to process a list of 10 URLs, checking the status of each. Use the IF node to log a specific message when the 5th URL is processed, ensuring you understand batch processing and conditional logic.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently handle batch processes, reduce errors, and automate tasks sequentially. This skill can help you offer robust automation solutions to clients, increasing your service value and potential income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
