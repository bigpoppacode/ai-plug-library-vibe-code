# Manual EditImage Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×4, editImage×4, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile_banner.json`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow updates a Twitter profile banner by using avatars of the most recent followers. It fetches the latest followers' profile images, processes them by resizing and cropping, and then composites these images onto a background template. Finally, it uploads the new banner to Twitter.

**Demonstrate**  
A social media manager could use this workflow to automatically refresh a brand's Twitter banner with the latest follower avatars, creating a dynamic and engaging display that acknowledges new followers.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Twitter account for authentication.  
3. Set up the user ID and template image URL.  
4. Execute the workflow to test the banner update process.  
5. Customize the image processing steps if needed.

**Practice**  
Create a test Twitter account and use this workflow to update the banner. Try altering the template image and see how different layouts affect the final banner. Observe the changes on your Twitter profile.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer unique social media services, enhancing brand engagement through dynamic content. This can attract clients seeking innovative social media strategies, providing opportunities to increase your service offerings and generate additional income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, oAuth1Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
