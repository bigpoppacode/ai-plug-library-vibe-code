This n8n workflow is designed to send an SMS message using the Sms77 service. When manually triggered, it sends a predefined message, "Hello from n8n!", to a specified recipient. This is a simple automation that demonstrates how to integrate SMS sending capabilities into your workflows.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to send quick updates or alerts to customers or team members. For example, a consultant could set it up to notify clients of a completed task or upcoming meeting, enhancing communication efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up a manual trigger to initiate the workflow.
3. Connect your Sms77 account by adding credentials.
4. Customize the message and recipient number in the Sms77 node.
5. Execute the workflow to test the SMS sending process.

### Practice
Create a simple test by using your own phone number to receive the SMS. Modify the message content and observe how changes affect the output. Experiment by setting a schedule trigger instead of a manual trigger for automated SMS sending.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer SMS notification services to clients, adding a valuable communication tool to your offerings. This can enhance client satisfaction and expand your service portfolio, potentially leading to increased revenue and client retention in your automation business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
