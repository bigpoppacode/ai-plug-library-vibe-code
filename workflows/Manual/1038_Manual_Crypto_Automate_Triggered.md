# Manual Crypto Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, crypto.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Crypto**.
  2. **Crypto** `crypto` — value: "n8n rocks!"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow allows a user to manually trigger an action that encrypts the phrase "n8n rocks!" using a Crypto node. It's a simple demonstration of how n8n can perform cryptographic operations on data, showcasing the platform's capability to handle encryption tasks.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to test encryption functionality for a project that requires securing data, such as encrypting sensitive information before storing it in a database.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the workflow.
3. Connect the Trigger node to a Crypto node.
4. Set the Crypto node to encrypt the phrase "n8n rocks!".
5. Execute the workflow to see the encrypted result.

### Practice
Create a new workflow that encrypts a different phrase or text. Use the Crypto node to experiment with different encryption settings and observe how the output changes. This will help you understand the node's capabilities.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer data security solutions, a highly valuable service in today's digital landscape. It can open opportunities to attract clients needing secure data handling, thus expanding your service offerings and potential revenue streams in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
