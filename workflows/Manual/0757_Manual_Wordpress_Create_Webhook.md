# Manual Wordpress Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "660", height: "1000"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "280", content: "# Modify This Prompt

5. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
6. **settings** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
7. **Retrieve WordPress Article** `wordpress` — operation: **get**
8. **Generate Summary or Transcription** `chainLlm` — text: "={{ $json.content }}", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
9. **Generate Speech** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/voice_id`
10. **Upload MP3** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ $('settings').item.json['site_url'] }}wp-json/wp/v2/media`
11. **Update WordPress Post** `wordpress` — operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**: This n8n workflow automates the process of converting WordPress articles into audio content. It retrieves an article from WordPress, uses OpenAI to generate a summary or transcription, converts the text to speech using Eleven Labs API, uploads the resulting MP3 back to WordPress, and updates the post to include the audio file, making the content more accessible and engaging.

**Demonstrate**: A blogger could use this workflow to automatically add audio versions of their posts, catering to audiences who prefer listening over reading, thereby increasing engagement and accessibility.

**Imitate**: 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect WordPress and Eleven Labs API credentials.
3. Set up a manual trigger or schedule.
4. Customize the WordPress post ID and MP3 upload settings.
5. Test the workflow to ensure articles are converted and updated correctly.

**Practice**: Create a test WordPress post and run the workflow. Check if the MP3 is generated and linked correctly in the post. Modify the text-to-speech settings to see how changes affect the output.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer audio content creation services, enhancing blog accessibility and engagement. This can lead to new income streams from clients looking to expand their content reach, making you a valuable asset in digital marketing and content creation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** wordpressApi, httpCustomAuth, openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
