  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves contact data from a CRM system (simulated here with mock data), extracts names and email addresses, and prepares them for insertion into a spreadsheet or database. It automates the process of collecting and organizing contact information for further use, such as marketing or sales efforts.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to automatically update their Google Sheets with the latest contacts from their CRM. This ensures they have an up-to-date list for email marketing campaigns, without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect to your CRM to replace the mock data.
3. Integrate a Google Sheets or Airtable node to append the extracted data.
4. Test the workflow by executing it and checking the data update.
5. Schedule it for regular updates.

### Practice
Create a mock CRM data set and run the workflow to populate a Google Sheet. Try adding new fields (like phone numbers) to the workflow to see how it adapts. Test it with variations in data to ensure robustness.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data management, saving time and reducing errors. It can help you offer data integration services to clients, enhancing your automation business with efficient and scalable solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
