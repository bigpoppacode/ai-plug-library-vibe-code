# Manual HTTP Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set, manualTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Settings** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
4. **HTTP Request - Update Rank Math Meta** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ $('Settings').item.json["woocommerce url"] }}wp-json/rank-math-api/v1/update-meta`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow updates the SEO metadata of a WordPress site using the Rank Math plugin. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves the WooCommerce URL from a settings node, and then sends a POST request to update the metadata of a specific WordPress post, including its title, description, and canonical URL.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update SEO metadata for new products on their WooCommerce site, ensuring that their SEO information is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up your WooCommerce URL in the settings node. 3. Configure the HTTP node with your desired SEO metadata. 4. Connect your WordPress account credentials. 5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates the metadata correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a test WordPress post and run the workflow to update its SEO metadata. Check the post in WordPress to see if the changes were applied successfully. Experiment by changing the metadata values to see how they affect the post.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer SEO automation services to clients, helping them improve their site's search engine rankings efficiently. This can lead to new business opportunities and increased income in the field of digital marketing automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** wordpressApi, wooCommerceApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
