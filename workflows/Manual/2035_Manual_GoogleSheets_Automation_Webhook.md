# Manual GoogleSheets Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://data.moa.gov.tw/api/v1/SheepQuotation`
4. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "Data"
5. **Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**: This n8n workflow fetches sheep market data from a specified API, processes each data entry individually, and appends the results into a Google Sheets document. When activated, it gathers data between specific dates for a particular market, splits the data into individual entries, and logs them for further analysis or reporting.

**Demonstrate**: A researcher or analyst might use this workflow to automate the collection of agricultural market data, ensuring they have the latest information in a structured format for analysis, without manual copying or data entry.

**Imitate**: To use this workflow:
1. Import it into n8n.
2. Set up your Google Sheets and API credentials.
3. Customize the API query parameters for your desired date range and market.
4. Run the workflow to test and ensure data is correctly logged in Google Sheets.

**Practice**: Create a new Google Sheet and modify the workflow to pull data for a different market or date range. Run the workflow and check the sheet to verify the data logging process.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data collection and management processes, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can enhance your service offerings, making you a valuable asset in fields requiring timely data analysis, like market research or consultancy.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
