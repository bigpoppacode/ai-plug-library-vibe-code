# Manual AWSSES Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, awsSes.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **AWS SES**.
  2. **AWS SES** `awsSes` — body: "This is a sample message body in an email
", subject: "n8n Rocks", fromEmail: "n8n@n8n.io"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow sends an email using AWS SES (Simple Email Service) whenever manually triggered. It uses a manual trigger node to start the process and an AWS SES node to send an email with a subject "n8n Rocks" and a sample message body to specified recipient email addresses. This workflow is useful for sending test emails or notifications.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to send a test email to themselves and their team to ensure their email setup is working correctly. It's useful for verifying AWS SES configurations before implementing in a larger automation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your AWS SES account in n8n.
3. Replace the example email addresses with your target recipients.
4. Manually trigger the workflow to send a test email.
5. Verify the email is received by the intended recipients.

### Practice
Create a simple email list in n8n and modify the workflow to send a personalized greeting to each recipient. Test the workflow to ensure each recipient receives a unique message. This will help reinforce understanding of dynamic data handling in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to ensure reliable email communication for clients, a critical component of many business operations. This skill can be leveraged to offer email automation services, enhancing your service offerings and increasing potential revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** aws.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
