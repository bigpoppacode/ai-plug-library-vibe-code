# Manual Noop Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×3, manualTrigger, function.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **NoOp**.
  2. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.

  ### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger that, when executed, runs a function node to generate three items with IDs 0, 1, and 2. A switch node then routes each item based on its ID: ID 0 to "Set" node (sets name to "n8n"), ID 1 to "Set1" node (sets name to "nodemation"), and ID 2 to "Set2" node (sets name to "nathan"). If none match, it defaults to a NoOp node, which does nothing.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to dynamically assign tasks or configurations based on input IDs, such as setting different user roles or configurations based on user ID.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect the manual trigger to a data source.
3. Adjust the function node to output relevant IDs.
4. Modify the "Set" nodes to apply desired configurations.
5. Test by executing the workflow manually.

### Practice
Create a basic workflow using the manual trigger and function nodes. Modify the function to output different IDs and observe how the switch node routes them to different "Set" nodes. Adjust the "Set" values and see the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you efficiently automate decision-based processes, enhancing productivity and allowing you to offer customized automation solutions to clients, potentially increasing your service offerings and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
