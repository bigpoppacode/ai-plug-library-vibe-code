# Manual Start Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, manualTrigger, start.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request1**.
  2. **HTTP Request1** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile_banner.json`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating a Twitter profile banner. It downloads an image from Unsplash and then uploads it to Twitter as the new profile banner. The workflow uses two HTTP request nodes: one to download the image and another to upload it to the Twitter API.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to periodically update their Twitter profile banner with fresh, relevant images, keeping their social media presence engaging and updated without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Twitter account using OAuth1 credentials.
3. Set up the download URL for the desired image from Unsplash.
4. Test the workflow to ensure the image updates on your Twitter profile correctly.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that updates your Twitter profile picture instead of the banner. Experiment with different image sources and try scheduling the workflow to run automatically at set intervals.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can offer social media management services to clients, automating their profile updates and enhancing their online presence. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and the potential for upselling more comprehensive social media automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** oAuth1Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
