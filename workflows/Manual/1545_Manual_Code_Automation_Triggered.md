# Manual Code Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using PdfToText×2, html2Pdf, code.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **HTML to PDF** `html2Pdf` — htmlInput: "<h1>Hello World</h1>"
4. **Code** `code` — jsCode: "return {"json": {"path": "https://www.nlbk.niedersachsen.de/download/164891/Test-pdf_3.pdf.pdf"}};"
5. **Convert PDF into Text** `PdfToText` — configured for its default action.
6. **Convert PDF into Text1** `PdfToText` — resource: **url**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow converts HTML to a PDF and extracts text from PDFs. It starts manually, converts a "Hello World" HTML into a PDF, then extracts text from this PDF. Simultaneously, it fetches another PDF from a URL, extracts its text, and outputs the results. This is useful for automating document processing tasks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this to automate the conversion of web content into PDFs for archiving, and extract text from PDFs for data analysis or integration into other systems.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect any necessary credentials.
3. Set the HTML input and URL in the respective nodes.
4. Run the workflow to test the conversion and extraction processes.
5. Customize the HTML content or URL for different use cases.

### Practice
Create a simple HTML file, use the workflow to convert it into a PDF, and then extract text from it. Experiment by changing the HTML content and observe how the workflow processes it.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer document conversion and data extraction services, streamlining content management for businesses. This could expand your service offerings, attract more clients, and generate additional income in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** customJsApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
