# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×3, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request2**.
  2. **HTTP Request2** `httpRequest` — url: `https://reqres.in/api/users/2`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow performs a series of HTTP requests to a mock API. First, it retrieves a list of users, then posts a new user named "Neo" with the job "Programmer". Finally, it updates an existing user's job to "The Chosen One". This workflow demonstrates basic API interaction by retrieving, creating, and updating data.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate user management tasks, such as syncing user data between systems or updating user roles based on certain conditions, without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your HTTP API credentials if needed.
3. Configure the URLs and parameters as per your API requirements.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it performs the CRUD operations as expected.

### Practice
Create a test API endpoint using a service like Reqres. Modify the workflow to interact with your custom endpoint, experimenting with different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH) and data payloads.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to automate repetitive API interactions, saving time and reducing errors. This skill is valuable for creating efficient integrations, attracting clients who need custom automation solutions, and potentially increasing your income in the automation field.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
