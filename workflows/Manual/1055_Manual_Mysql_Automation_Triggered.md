# Manual MySQL Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set**.
  2. **Set** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to interact with a MySQL database. When executed manually, it creates a new table called "test" with columns "id" and "name". It then sets a specific value for the "name" field to "n8n" and inserts this data into the table. This process helps in setting up a database structure and populating it with initial data.

### Demonstrate
A developer setting up a new project database might use this workflow to quickly create a necessary table and insert initial data, streamlining the setup process and ensuring consistency across development environments.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your MySQL database credentials.
3. Execute the workflow manually to create the table and insert the data.
4. Verify the table creation and data insertion in your MySQL database.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to add a new column "email" to the "test" table and insert a sample email address. Execute and check if the new column and data are added correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate database management tasks, reducing manual errors and saving time. By offering database setup and maintenance services, you can enhance your automation business, attract more clients, and increase your income by providing reliable and efficient solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mySql.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
