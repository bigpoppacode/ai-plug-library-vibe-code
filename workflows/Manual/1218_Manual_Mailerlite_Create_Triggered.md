  ### Explain
This n8n workflow manages MailerLite subscribers. It manually triggers to create a new subscriber with an email and name, updates the subscriber's city to "Berlin," and retrieves the subscriber's data. It's a simple way to manage subscriber information in a MailerLite account.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow when they want to update their email list subscribers' details, like adding a city to their profile, ensuring that their marketing campaigns are targeted effectively.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up MailerLite credentials in the workflow.
3. Adjust the email and name details to match your subscriber.
4. Execute the workflow to create, update, and retrieve subscriber data.
5. Verify the updates in your MailerLite account.

### Practice
Create a test subscriber in MailerLite with a different email. Run the workflow to update the city field and check if it reflects correctly in MailerLite. Modify the city value to see how the workflow handles different updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow lets you efficiently manage email subscribers, improving your marketing strategies. Offering this as a service could attract clients looking to optimize their email marketing efforts, providing a steady income stream in the automation business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
