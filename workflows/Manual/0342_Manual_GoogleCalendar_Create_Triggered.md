  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to add an event to a Google Calendar. It has two steps: a manual trigger that initiates the workflow when executed, and a Google Calendar node that creates an event on the specified calendar. The event is scheduled from June 25, 2020, to June 27, 2020, on the calendar associated with the email address "shaligramshraddha@gmail.com". This automation is useful for simplifying the process of scheduling events without manually entering the details into Google Calendar.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically schedule recurring team meetings or project deadlines on their Google Calendar, ensuring everyone stays informed and aligned without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Calendar account.
3. Customize the event details (start, end, calendar email) as needed.
4. Execute the workflow manually to test the event creation.
5. Verify the event appears correctly in Google Calendar.

### Practice
Set up a test Google Calendar and use the workflow to add an event. Modify the event details, such as the date and time, and re-run the workflow to observe how changes are reflected in the calendar.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer calendar management services to clients, streamlining their scheduling processes. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and create additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
