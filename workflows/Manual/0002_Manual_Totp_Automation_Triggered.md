# Manual Totp Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, totp.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **TOTP** `totp` — options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow generates Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) codes. It starts with a manual trigger that allows you to test the workflow. The TOTP node then generates a secure code, which can be used for two-factor authentication (2FA) purposes. This is useful for enhancing security in applications by requiring a second form of verification.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to test the integration of 2FA in a web application, ensuring that users receive a TOTP code when they log in, adding an extra layer of security to user accounts.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your TOTP account credentials.
3. Click 'Test workflow' to manually trigger the workflow.
4. Observe the generated TOTP code for verification purposes.

### Practice
Create a simple app login page that accepts a TOTP code. Use this workflow to generate TOTP codes and verify if the app can correctly authenticate users by matching the codes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer enhanced security features like 2FA to clients, increasing the trust and security of their applications. This can lead to more client engagements and higher income opportunities in the automation and security domain.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** totpApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
