  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to create a new company record in Salesmate, a CRM system. It starts with a manual trigger, which means it requires someone to initiate the process by clicking 'execute'. Once triggered, the workflow proceeds to create a company in Salesmate using the provided API credentials. This setup allows users to manually add company data to their Salesmate CRM without entering it directly via the platform.

### Demonstrate

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
