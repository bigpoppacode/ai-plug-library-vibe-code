# Manual Extractfromfile Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×3, set×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "577.5890410958907", height: "253.58904109589045", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Basic Variables** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Download Excel** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.excel_source_url }}`
6. **Extract from File** `extractFromFile` — operation: **xlsx**
7. **Zammad Univeral User Object** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
8. **Find Zammad User by email** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $('Basic Variables').item.json.zammad_base_url }}api/v1/users/search?query=email:{{ $json.email }}`
9. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", fieldsToMatchString: "email"
10. **Update User Roles** `httpRequest` — method: **PUT**, url: `={{ $('Basic Variables').item.json.zammad_base_url }}/api/v1/users/{{ $json.id }}`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating user roles in a Zammad system using data from an Excel file. It downloads an Excel file containing user data, extracts the relevant information, and updates each user's role in Zammad by matching their email addresses. This ensures the user roles in Zammad are current and accurate, streamlining user management tasks.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business might use this workflow to regularly sync user roles from a central HR system (stored in Excel) to Zammad, ensuring that any changes in employee status are promptly reflected in their support roles.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up your Zammad API credentials.  
3. Define the Excel file URL in the workflow.  
4. Customize the Excel and Zammad fields to match your data structure.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates roles correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a sample Excel file with user emails and roles, then run the workflow. Verify that it updates the roles in Zammad as expected. Experiment by changing data in the Excel file to see how the workflow reacts.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage user roles across systems, offering this as a service to clients. This can enhance your portfolio in automation solutions, providing consistent value and opening doors to recurring revenue opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
