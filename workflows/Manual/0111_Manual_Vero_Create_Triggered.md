  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of user profiles in Vero. It starts with a manual trigger node, which, when executed, sends data to the Vero node. The Vero node then uses this data to create a new user profile in the Vero system, helping businesses manage their customer data more efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to quickly add new customers to their Vero database after acquiring their details, ensuring all customer information is up-to-date and ready for targeted marketing campaigns.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Vero API credentials to the Vero node.
3. Set up the manual trigger to execute when needed.
4. Customize the additional fields in the Vero node to include relevant customer data.
5. Test the workflow to ensure profiles are created correctly in Vero.

### Practice
Create a sample user in Vero using this workflow. Modify the input data in the Vero node to see how different data entries affect the creation of user profiles. This helps in understanding how to tailor the workflow to different data sets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage customer data, enabling personalized marketing strategies. This enhances customer engagement and can lead to increased sales, providing a valuable service to clients and generating income for your automation business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
