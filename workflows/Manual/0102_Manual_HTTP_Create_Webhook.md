# Manual HTTP Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Send email notification** `emailSend` — text: "=Here are the latest news attached!", options: "[object Object]", subject: "Ycombinator news"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting the latest news from Y Combinator's website and sending it via email. It starts manually, fetches the HTML content of the news page, extracts news titles and URLs, merges the data, saves it to a spreadsheet, and emails the spreadsheet to a specified recipient.

**Demonstrate**  
A tech blogger could use this workflow to automate gathering the latest tech news from Y Combinator, compiling it into a daily digest, and emailing it to subscribers, saving time and ensuring they share the most current information.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up your SMTP credentials in the email node.  
3. Run the workflow manually to test it.  
4. Adapt the URL and CSS selectors if you wish to fetch news from a different site.  
5. Schedule the workflow to run regularly.

**Practice**  
Create a test version of this workflow using a different news site. Adjust the URL and CSS selectors in the HTML Extract node to see how it changes the output. Test by sending the result to your email.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate news curation, offering a valuable service to clients who need regular updates. This can enhance your service offerings and provide a passive income stream through subscription-based news digests.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** smtp.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
