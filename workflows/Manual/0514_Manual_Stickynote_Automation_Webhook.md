# Manual Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, manualTrigger, readWriteFile.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "218", height: "132", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Download PPTX File** `httpRequest` — url: `https://cdn.convertapi.com/public/files/demo.pptx`
5. **File conversion to PDF** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://v2.convertapi.com/convert/pptx/to/pdf`
6. **Write Result File to Disk** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the conversion of a PowerPoint file (PPTX) to a PDF. It starts manually when you test the workflow, downloads a sample PPTX file from the internet, converts it to PDF using an online conversion API, and finally saves the resulting PDF file to disk. This process ensures you can quickly convert and store presentation files in a more universally accessible format.

### Demonstrate
A consultant may use this workflow to automate the conversion of presentation files for clients, ensuring all team members have access to documents in PDF format, which is easier to view and print across different devices and platforms.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your ConvertAPI account for authentication.
3. Set up the manual trigger to start the workflow.
4. Customize the URL to download your specific PPTX file.
5. Run the workflow and ensure the PDF is saved correctly.

### Practice
Create a folder on your local machine to store converted files. Run the workflow with different PPTX files to see how it handles various content. Experiment with changing file names and storage locations in the workflow settings.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow offers a service to clients who need efficient document management solutions, particularly in converting and archiving presentations. This skill can enhance your service offerings, leading to increased client satisfaction and potential upsells in document management automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpQueryAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
