This n8n workflow automates updating a person's information in Copper CRM. It starts when manually triggered, creates a new person in Copper with a specified email, updates their phone number, and retrieves their updated information. This ensures that contact details are consistently updated and accurate in the CRM.

### Demonstrate

2. Connect your Copper CRM account using API credentials.
3. Adjust the parameters in the Copper nodes to match the contact details you want to manage.
4. Execute the workflow to test the process and verify updates in Copper.

### Practice

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
