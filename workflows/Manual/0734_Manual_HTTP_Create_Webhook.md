# Manual HTTP Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, httpRequest, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Set Image Properties** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
4. **Fetch Image from API** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://dummyjson.com/image/{{ $json.size }}/{{ $json.backgroundColor }}/{{ $json.textColor }}`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to generate an image with specific properties. It begins with a manual trigger, which initiates the workflow when you click 'Test workflow'. The next step, 'Set Image Properties', assigns specific attributes to the image such as size, background color, text color, and text content. Finally, the 'Fetch Image from API' node uses these properties to construct a URL and fetch the generated image from an external API.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to quickly generate placeholder images for website mockups, saving time by automating the creation of images with consistent design elements like color and text.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger for testing.
3. Adjust image properties in the 'Set Image Properties' node to your preferences.
4. Run the workflow and fetch the image using the API.

### Practice
Create a workflow that generates images with different text messages each time you test it. Use variables to change the text property dynamically and observe how each image updates accordingly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated graphic design services, allowing you to quickly produce customized visuals for clients. This efficiency can enhance your service offerings and potentially increase your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
