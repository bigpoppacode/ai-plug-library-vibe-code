  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing a subscriber in e-goi, an email marketing platform. It begins with manually triggering the workflow, creating a new subscriber with a specified email and first name. It then updates the subscriber's first name and finally retrieves the subscriber's information to confirm the update.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to efficiently manage their email marketing lists, ensuring subscriber information is always up-to-date without manual intervention, thus saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your e-goi credentials.
3. Customize the email and list parameters to match your subscriber details.
4. Execute the workflow to test creating, updating, and retrieving a subscriber.

### Practice
Create a test subscriber in e-goi with your email. Run the workflow to see the subscriber's first name update from "Nathan" to "Nat" and confirm by retrieving the updated information.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer email list management services, improving client marketing efficiency. This capability can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and boost income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
