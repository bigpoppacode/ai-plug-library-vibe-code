  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of posting on Reddit and adding comments. It starts with a manual trigger, which creates a new post in the "n8n" subreddit using the Reddit node. After the post is created, the workflow retrieves the post details and then adds a comment to the newly created post, all within Reddit.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate community engagement on Reddit, ensuring their posts are followed up with comments to increase visibility and interaction, saving time on manual posting and commenting.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Reddit account using OAuth credentials.
3. Customize the post title, content, and subreddit as needed.
4. Click 'Execute' to test the workflow and see the post and comment on Reddit.

### Practice
Create a test subreddit or use a personal one. Run the workflow to post and comment, then experiment by changing the post content and observing how it affects engagement. This helps you understand the impact of different types of content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage Reddit interactions, which can boost your online presence and engagement. For an automation business, this skill can expand your service offerings, attract clients looking to optimize their social media strategies, and increase revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** redditOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
