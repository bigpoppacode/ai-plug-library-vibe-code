  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of adding a new subscriber to a mailing list and sending them a welcome email campaign using Sendy. It begins with a manual trigger, adds the subscriber's email to a specified list in Sendy, and then creates and sends a welcome email campaign to the new subscriber.

2. Connect your Sendy account.
3. Set up the email list and campaign details in the Sendy nodes.
4. Test the workflow by manually executing it to ensure the subscriber is added and the email is sent.

### Practice
Create a test subscriber list in Sendy and use this workflow to add a test email. Execute the workflow to see if the welcome campaign is sent to the new subscriber. Adjust the email content and list ID to fit your needs.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
