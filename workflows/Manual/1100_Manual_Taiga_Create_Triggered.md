  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates issue management in Taiga, a project management tool. It begins by manually triggering the creation of a new issue in Taiga with a specified subject and project ID. The issue is then updated with a description, and finally, the workflow retrieves the updated issue details. This helps teams efficiently manage and track tasks or bugs within their projects.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to automate the process of creating, updating, and retrieving issues in their project management system, ensuring that all team members have up-to-date information on tasks and bugs.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Taiga account.
3. Set the manual trigger to initiate the workflow.
4. Customize the subject, project ID, and description fields.
5. Execute the workflow to test issue creation and retrieval in Taiga.

### Practice
Create a test project in Taiga and use the workflow to add a few issues. Modify the issue descriptions and verify that the workflow updates and retrieves the correct information. Experiment with different project IDs and subjects.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to streamline project management tasks, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. Offering this as a service can attract clients who need efficient task management, enhancing your automation business and increasing revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
