# Manual QuestDB Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **QuestDB1**.
  2. **QuestDB1** `questDb` — table: `test`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to create a table and insert data into it using QuestDB. It starts when manually triggered, creating a table named `test` with columns `id` and `name`. It then sets a value for `name` as "Tanay" and inserts this data into the table, ensuring the database is updated with this information.

**Demonstrate:**  
A startup could use this workflow to quickly set up a database for tracking user information, automatically creating tables and inserting initial data entries, which is crucial during the initial setup phase.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the QuestDB credentials.
3. Trigger the workflow manually to create the table.
4. Customize the data in the "Set" node as required.
5. Run the workflow to insert data into the QuestDB table.

**Practice:**  
Create a new table in QuestDB with different columns, modify the "Set" node to include different data, and execute the workflow to see how it updates the database. Experiment with changing data types and values to understand the process.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate database management tasks, saving time and reducing manual errors. This skill can be marketed to businesses needing efficient data handling solutions, enhancing your service offerings and income potential in the automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** questDb.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
