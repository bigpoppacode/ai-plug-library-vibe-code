  ### Explain
This n8n workflow processes a text message by converting it to lowercase, uppercase, and replacing a specific phrase. It starts with a manual trigger to set a message, then splits into three paths: converting to lowercase, uppercase, and replacing "Un León" with "Una Jirafa". The results are merged and outputted.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to automate text formatting tasks, ensuring consistent capitalization and terminology in marketing materials or content management systems.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Customize the initial message in the Set node.
4. Run the workflow to see the text transformations.
5. Adjust the commands to suit your specific text processing needs.

### Practice
Create a new message in the Set node, then execute the workflow. Observe how each transformation node processes the text. Try modifying the replacement text or adding new transformations to see how they affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive text processing tasks, increasing efficiency and consistency in your projects. This skill can be a valuable service for clients needing text manipulation automation, leading to potential revenue streams in an automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
