# Manual Awstextract Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, awsTextract, awsS3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **AWS S3**.
  2. **AWS S3** `awsS3` — fileKey: "Rechnung.jpg", bucketName: "textract-demodata"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of text from an image stored in an AWS S3 bucket using AWS Textract. When executed, it retrieves the specified image file from the S3 bucket and processes it with AWS Textract to extract any text content. This is useful for automating document processing tasks like invoice or receipt scanning.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically extract text from invoices uploaded to an S3 bucket, streamlining their accounting process by reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy.

### Imitate
1. Set up an AWS S3 bucket and upload an image file.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Connect your AWS credentials.
4. Configure the S3 node with your bucket name and file key.
5. Execute the workflow to test text extraction from your image.

### Practice
Create a test S3 bucket and upload a sample image with text. Run the workflow to see how it extracts text. Change the image and observe the results to understand how text extraction varies with different documents.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated document processing services, saving clients time and reducing errors in data entry. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase income as part of an AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** aws.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
