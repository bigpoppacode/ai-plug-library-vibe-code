# Manual Cortex Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using cortex×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cortex1**.
  2. **Cortex1** `cortex` — resource: **job**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to analyze a URL using Cortex, a tool for security analysis, and retrieve the results of the analysis. It begins with a manual trigger that, when executed, sends a URL to Cortex to be analyzed for potential abuse or threats. The analysis job is tracked, and the results are fetched to provide insights into the URL's safety.

### Demonstrate
A cybersecurity consultant can use this workflow to quickly assess the safety of URLs before sharing them with clients, ensuring that links are free from malware or phishing threats, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of communications.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Cortex credentials in n8n.
3. Customize the URL in the Cortex node to the one you want to analyze.
4. Execute the workflow manually and observe the results.
5. Adjust the workflow to automate regular URL checks.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by inputting a URL known to be safe and another suspected of being malicious. Run the workflow and compare the analysis results. This experiment will help you understand how Cortex classifies URLs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer cybersecurity assessments as part of your services, adding value to your offerings. This can attract clients needing regular security checks, leading to potential recurring revenue for your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cortexApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
