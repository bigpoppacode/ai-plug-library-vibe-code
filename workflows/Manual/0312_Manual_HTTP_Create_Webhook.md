  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of drafting and sending an email using Microsoft Outlook. It starts manually and creates a draft email with a specified subject and body. It then downloads an image from a URL, attaches it to the draft, and finally sends the email to a specified recipient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate sending marketing emails with attachments, saving time on manual email preparations, and ensuring consistency in communication.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Microsoft Outlook account.
3. Customize the email subject, body, and recipient.
4. Set the URL for any image you want to attach.
5. Execute the workflow to test sending an email.

### Practice
Create a test email draft in Outlook with a different attachment and recipient. Run the workflow to observe the automation in action and modify parameters to see different results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage email campaigns, reducing manual workload and errors. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract clients, and increase revenue in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
