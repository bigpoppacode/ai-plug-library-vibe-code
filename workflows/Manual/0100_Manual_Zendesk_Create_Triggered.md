  ### Explain
This n8n workflow creates a ticket in Zendesk when manually triggered. It consists of two nodes: a manual trigger node that initiates the workflow when executed, and a Zendesk node that creates a new ticket in Zendesk. This setup allows users to manually input data to generate a support ticket in Zendesk, which can be useful for tracking customer inquiries or issues.

### Demonstrate
A customer support manager might use this workflow to manually log customer issues that are reported via phone calls or face-to-face interactions, ensuring all customer interactions are documented and tracked within Zendesk.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Zendesk account in the Zendesk node.
3. Customize the ticket creation fields in the Zendesk node to match your requirements.
4. Manually execute the workflow to test ticket creation in Zendesk.

### Practice
Create a test ticket in Zendesk using the workflow. Modify the ticket fields and description to see how the changes are reflected in Zendesk. This helps reinforce understanding of how data is passed and utilized in creating tickets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline ticket creation processes, improving efficiency in customer support operations. This skill can be valuable for offering enhanced client services, leading to potential income generation through automation services in customer support.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
