# Manual Stickynote Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, code, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "883", height: "430", content: "[redacted]"
4. **EXAMPLE FIELDS** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **TOTP VALIDATION** `code` — language: "python", pythonCode: "[redacted]"
6. **IF CODE IS VALID** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow in n8n verifies Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) for authentication purposes. It uses a manual trigger to start the workflow, retrieves sample TOTP secret and code values, and runs Python code to check if the provided TOTP code is valid. If the code matches the expected value, it proceeds to the next step; otherwise, it stops, indicating an invalid code.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to enhance security by verifying 2FA codes for user logins. It helps ensure that only users with valid TOTP codes can access sensitive systems or data.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger node to start the workflow.
3. Input your TOTP secret and code in the "EXAMPLE FIELDS" node.
4. Run the Python code in the "TOTP VALIDATION" node to verify the code.
5. Check the "IF CODE IS VALID" node to see if the code is correct.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by generating a TOTP secret and code. Use the workflow to verify if the code is valid. Experiment by altering the code to see how the workflow reacts to invalid inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer robust authentication solutions, increasing the security of applications and systems. This skill is valuable for clients needing secure user verification, potentially increasing your service offerings and income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
