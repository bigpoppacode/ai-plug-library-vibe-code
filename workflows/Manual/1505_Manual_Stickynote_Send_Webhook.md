# Manual Stickynote Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, stickyNote×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "[redacted]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — content: "You can get chat_id https://open.larksuite.com/api-explorer/"
5. **Input** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **Get Lark Token** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `[redacted]`

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending a message in Lark Suite. It starts with a manual trigger to test the workflow. It then retrieves necessary credentials and chat information using a set node and requests a Lark access token via an HTTP POST request. Finally, it sends a message to a specified chat in Lark Suite using another HTTP POST request.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate notifications in a team chat on Lark Suite when certain events occur, like new customer signups, ensuring the team stays informed without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the manual trigger to test.
3. Configure the set node with your Lark app credentials and chat ID.
4. Ensure the HTTP request nodes have the correct URLs and payloads.
5. Run the workflow to test sending messages.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that sends a message to yourself in Lark Suite. Modify the message content and observe how it updates in the chat. Experiment with different trigger conditions to automate various notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help automate communication tasks, saving time and ensuring timely team updates. By offering this as a service, you can add value to businesses looking to streamline their internal communications, potentially increasing your client base and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
