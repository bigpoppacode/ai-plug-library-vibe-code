# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×4, manualTrigger, cron.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Auth TTRss**.
  2. **Auth TTRss** `httpRequest` — url: `http://{HERE-YOUR-TTRSS-HOST}/tt-rss/api/`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of transferring starred articles from Tiny Tiny RSS (TTRss) to Wallabag. It authenticates with both services, retrieves starred articles from TTRss, checks for new articles since the last run, and posts them to Wallabag. It uses a cron trigger to run every 10 minutes, ensuring your saved articles are regularly updated in Wallabag for easy reading and management.

**Demonstrate:**  
A blogger or researcher could use this workflow to automatically save interesting articles for later reading, ensuring they never miss out on important content while organizing it effectively in Wallabag.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Configure TTRss and Wallabag credentials.
3. Set up your TTRss and Wallabag URLs in the HTTP Request nodes.
4. Customize the cron timing if needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and posts articles correctly.

**Practice:**  
Set up a small TTRss feed with a few articles. Star some articles and run the workflow. Check Wallabag to confirm the starred articles appear. Adjust the cron timing and test again to see how the scheduling impacts updates.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a seamless content curation service, saving clients time and effort in managing their reading list. It can lead to recurring income as a value-added service in your automation business, enhancing client satisfaction and retention.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
