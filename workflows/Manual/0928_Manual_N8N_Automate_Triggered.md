# Manual N8n Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using n8n×2, if, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "620", height: "420"
4. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
5. **TAG? Auto start** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
6. **n8n1** `n8n` — operation: **activate**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automatically start other workflows tagged with "Auto start" when n8n begins running. It uses a manual trigger to begin the process, checks all workflows in the n8n instance for the "Auto start" tag, and activates those workflows. This ensures that specific workflows restart automatically without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to ensure that critical automated processes, like data backups or daily report generation, restart automatically whenever the n8n instance is rebooted, minimizing downtime and manual oversight.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the manual trigger.
3. Ensure your workflows are tagged with "Auto start."
4. Activate the workflow to test it.
5. Restart n8n to see if tagged workflows start automatically.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow in n8n, tag it with "Auto start," and run the main workflow to see if your tagged workflow activates. Modify the tag and test again to understand how tagging affects activation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer clients automated system recovery solutions, ensuring critical business processes are always running. This can enhance your service offerings and lead to increased client satisfaction and retention, boosting your automation business's value and income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
