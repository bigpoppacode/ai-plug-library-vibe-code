# Manual Facebookgraphapi Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, facebookGraphApi.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Facebook Graph API**.
  2. **Facebook Graph API** `facebookGraphApi` — node: "me", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves the first and last name of a Facebook user using the Facebook Graph API. It starts with a manual trigger, meaning you activate the workflow by clicking 'execute'. Once triggered, it pulls the user's first and last name from the Facebook account linked to the credentials provided.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to quickly verify user identities for a Facebook app, ensuring that the user data aligns with their Facebook account information. This can enhance data accuracy and user verification processes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Facebook account to provide the necessary credentials.
3. Manually trigger the workflow by clicking 'execute'.
4. Observe the retrieved data to ensure it fetches the correct user information.

### Practice
Create a Facebook app and link it to n8n. Run the workflow to fetch your own user data, then try modifying the workflow to retrieve additional fields like email or profile picture, testing each change to see the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer services that integrate Facebook user data, improving data validation processes for clients. This skill can expand your service offerings and increase your value in the automation business, potentially leading to higher income opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** facebookGraphApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
