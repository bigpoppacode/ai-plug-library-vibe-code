  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves details of a specified forum from Disqus. It starts with a manual trigger and then uses the Disqus node to fetch forum information. This can be useful for monitoring discussions, analyzing engagement, or gathering data for content strategy.

### Demonstrate
A content manager might use this workflow to regularly check the activity and engagement levels on their company's Disqus forum, helping them understand what topics resonate most with their audience.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Disqus node with your API credentials.
3. Modify the forum ID to match the forum you want to monitor.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves the correct forum data.

### Practice
Create a test Disqus forum and use the workflow to fetch its details. Check how the data changes when you post new comments or topics, and adjust the node's parameters if needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer forum monitoring services, helping clients understand and engage with their audience better. This can lead to improved content strategies and increased customer satisfaction, enhancing your service portfolio.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** disqusApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
