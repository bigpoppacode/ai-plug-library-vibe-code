9. **ENV*** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Clean and Escape ENV** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
11. **Get all Invoices*** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices`
12. **List Invoices** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "data"
13. **We do only Invoice Objects** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **Download Invoice PDF from Stripe** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.invoice_pdf }}`
15. **It shouldn't be something else** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "Unexpected or missing Invoice Obj"
16. **Inject s3 Subpath** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automatically syncs monthly invoices from Stripe to an AWS S3 bucket. It retrieves invoices from Stripe, downloads their PDFs, and uploads them to a specified S3 bucket with a structured path based on the year and month. This ensures that all invoices are backed up and organized efficiently.

**Demonstrate**  
A small business owner could use this workflow to automatically archive their monthly Stripe invoices in an AWS S3 bucket for accounting purposes, ensuring they have a secure and organized backup for financial audits.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure Stripe and AWS S3 credentials.
3. Set the S3 bucket name and folder path in the ENV node.
4. Schedule the workflow to run monthly.
5. Test the workflow to ensure correct setup and functionality.

**Practice**  
Create a test workflow using a mock Stripe account and an S3 bucket. Run the workflow to verify that invoices are downloaded and uploaded correctly, then modify the folder paths to see how changes affect storage organization.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated invoice management services to clients, enhancing financial organization and compliance. This can lead to increased efficiency and open up new revenue streams in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
