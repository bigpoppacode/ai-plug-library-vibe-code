# Stopanderror ClickUp Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Create tasks** `toolWorkflow` — name: "create_task", schemaType: "manual", workflowId: "[object Object]"
4. **Create follow-up call** `microsoftOutlookTool` — resource: **event**, operation: **create**
5. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1000", height: "280", content: "## Sub workflow: Create Task in ClickUp"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "660", height: "520", content: "## Welcome to my Zoom AI Meeting Assistant Workflow!

### This workflow has the following sequence:

1. manual trigger (Can be replaced by a scheduled trigger or a webhook)
2. retr…[truncated]"
8. **Anthropic Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — model: `[object Object]`
9. **Think** `toolThink` — configured for its default action.
10. **Zoom: Get data of last meeting** `zoom` — operation: **getAll**
11. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "query.items"
12. **Filter: Last 24 hours** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **ClickUp** `clickUp` — list: "901207046581", name: "={{ $json.name }}", team: "9012366821"
14. **Zoom: Get transcripts data** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.zoom.us/v2/meetings/{{ $json.id }}/recordings`
15. **Filter transcript URL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
16. **No Recording/Transcript available** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "={{ $json.error.cause.message }}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing Zoom meetings by retrieving meeting data, extracting transcript text, and identifying tasks and follow-up actions. It filters meetings from the last 24 hours, extracts and formats transcript data, and then uses AI to create tasks in ClickUp and schedule follow-up meetings in Outlook, based on the meeting discussions.

**Demonstrate:**  
A consultant could use this workflow to automatically document meeting minutes, create tasks, and schedule follow-up meetings, ensuring efficient client interactions and project management.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Zoom, ClickUp, and Outlook accounts.
3. Configure the trigger to run after each meeting.
4. Customize task creation fields in ClickUp and calendar details in Outlook.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and processes meeting data correctly.

**Practice:**  
Try hosting a test Zoom meeting, then run the workflow to see how it handles the transcript and task creation. Modify some meeting details to observe how the workflow adapts to different inputs.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated meeting management services, enhancing your productivity and value to clients. It can help streamline operations, improve project tracking, and potentially increase revenue by offering as a service to other businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** zoomOAuth2Api, smtp, microsoftOutlookOAuth2Api, clickUpOAuth2Api, anthropicApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
