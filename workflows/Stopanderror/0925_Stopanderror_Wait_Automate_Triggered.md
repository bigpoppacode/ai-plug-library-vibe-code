# Stopanderror Wait Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×12, executeWorkflow×12, wait×4.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When Executed by Another Workflow**.
2. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
3. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "860", height: "420", content: "## Check if working
Will output status if something is going on.

Inputs:
- action -> "get"
- key -> a string used for tracking

* Remove unused inputs when calling workflow *"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "1080", height: "420", content: "## Set workflow start

Inputs:
- action -> "set"
- key -> a string used for tracking
- value -> "working" by default but you can use whatever, you can use this multiple times in co…[truncated]"
6. **Is Workflow Active** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
7. **Set Workflow Active** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "820", height: "640", content: "## Set workflow end
This mark workflow end by unsetting the key.

Inputs:
- action -> "unset"
- key -> a string used for tracking

* Remove unused inputs when calling workflow *"
9. **Set Workflow Finished** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
10. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "1120", height: "640"
11. **Is Workflow Active1** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
12. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "740", height: "260"
13. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1980", height: "500"
14. **Is Workflow Active2** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
15. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "260"
16. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1980", height: "1120"
17. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "260"
18. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "260"
19. **Is Workflow Active3** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
20. **Sticky Note10** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "660", height: "340"
21. **Sticky Note11** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "400", height: "320"
22. **Set Timeout** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
23. **If2** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
24. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
25. **If1** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
26. **Switch1** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
27. **Switch** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
28. **Set Workflow Active1** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
29. **Stop and Error** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "Already Executing"
30. **Set Workflow "started"** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
31. **Stop and Error1** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "Already Executing"
32. **Get Key** `redis` — operation: **get**
33. **Set Key** `redis` — operation: **set**
34. **UnSet Key** `redis` — operation: **delete**
35. **No Operation, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
36. **Wait1** `wait` — configured for its default action.
37. **set continue** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
38. **Wait** `wait` — configured for its default action.
39. **Set Workflow "loading"** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
40. **Set Workflow Finished1** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
41. **Wait2** `wait` — configured for its default action.
42. **Set Workflow "finishing"** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow is designed to prevent concurrent executions of a given workflow by using Redis as a temporary storage system. It manages the execution states by setting and checking keys in Redis. Before the workflow starts, it checks if a key is already set (indicating that the workflow is currently running). If not, it sets a key to indicate that the workflow is active. Once the workflow completes, it unsets the key, allowing future executions.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer might use this workflow to ensure that a data processing script doesn't run multiple times simultaneously, which could lead to data corruption or duplicate processing, especially in financial transactions or data migrations.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect to a Redis instance.
3. Configure the keys and actions for your specific workflow.
4. Set the timeout duration as needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it prevents concurrent runs.

**Practice**  
Create a test workflow that writes to a database or sends an email. Use the Redis-based concurrency control workflow to ensure the test workflow doesn't run more than once at a time. Observe how the workflow behaves when triggered multiple times in quick succession.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer robust automation solutions that require concurrency management, appealing to clients in industries where data integrity is crucial. This skill can enhance your service offerings, leading to higher-value contracts and increased client trust in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** redis.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
