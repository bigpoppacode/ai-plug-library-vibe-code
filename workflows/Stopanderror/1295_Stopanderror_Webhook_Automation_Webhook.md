# Stopanderror Webhook Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×7, httpRequest×2, set×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note1**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "238.05017098334866", height: "140.50170983348636"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "623.7263504769883", height: "397.87914003146636"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "437.4336297478876", height: "107.35461655041311"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "1296.8510714753793", height: "256.53228919365705", content: "## Step 1: Authentication
"
6. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "1302.371850917427", height: "444.78164181462137", content: "[redacted]"
7. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "327.74230574931124", height: "144.40136786678917"
8. **/login** `webhook` — path: `/login`
9. **/receive-token** `webhook` — path: `/[redacted]`
10. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "426.62126002791706", height: "393.48225931142105"
11. **Set Application Details** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
12. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **Open Auth Webpage** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", redirectURL: "[redacted]", respondWith: "redirect"
14. **Set Application Details1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
15. **No Code Found** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "[redacted]"
16. **Request Access Token** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `[redacted]`
17. **Get Userinfo** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $('Set Application Details1').item.json.domain }}/userinfo`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow facilitates user authentication via OAuth using Auth0. It begins with a `/login` webhook for initiating authentication, directing users to an Auth0 login page. Upon successful login, users are redirected to `/receive-token`, where an authorization code is exchanged for an access token. This token is then used to fetch user information, ensuring secure access to authenticated areas of an application.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to integrate OAuth authentication into a web app, enhancing security by managing user sessions and access control effectively, especially when dealing with sensitive data.

### Imitate
1. Set up an Auth0 app and configure callback URLs.
2. Import the workflow into n8n and connect your Auth0 account.
3. Customize the `Set Application Details` nodes with your Auth0 domain, client ID, and secret.
4. Test the workflow by accessing the `/login` endpoint to initiate authentication.

### Practice
Create a test Auth0 application and run the workflow, observing how it handles user authentication. Modify the Auth0 settings to test different login scenarios or providers like GitHub.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer secure authentication solutions to clients, crucial for applications involving user data. This skill can help you expand your service offerings, attracting more clients looking for robust security implementations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
