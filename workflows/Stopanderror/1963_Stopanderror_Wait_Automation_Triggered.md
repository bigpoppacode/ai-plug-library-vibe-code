# Stopanderror Wait Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×9, noOp×3, set×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Manual Trigger**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "240", content: "## Set filter
Filter by status code or error message."
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "320", content: "## Replace Node
Replace this by the Node which retrieves the admired data.
Enable error branch in Node Settings and connect the outputs like in this example"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "220", content: "## Set max tries
Change if needed, default is 3"
5. **Manual Trigger** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "240", content: "## Set Wait
Change duration if needed, default is 5s"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "200"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "200"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "220"
10. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "220"
11. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "220"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow template is designed to retry a process up to three times if it fails, except when a known error occurs. It initializes a retry counter, attempts a process, and checks for errors. If a known error is detected, it stops retrying. Otherwise, it waits for a set duration before retrying until the maximum number of attempts is reached. If all retries fail, an error message is triggered.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to handle API requests that occasionally fail due to network issues, ensuring that temporary errors don't disrupt operations, while known errors are handled differently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow in n8n.
2. Replace "Replace Me" with your desired process node.
3. Set conditions for known errors in the "Catch known error" node.
4. Adjust the retry count and wait duration as needed.
5. Test the workflow with different scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected.

### Practice
Create a simple API call workflow and integrate this retry mechanism. Simulate network failures and known errors to observe how the workflow handles each situation, ensuring it retries appropriately and stops for known errors.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to create robust automations that can handle transient errors gracefully, improving service reliability. This skill can enhance your offerings in an automation business, attracting clients who need dependable systems, thereby increasing your revenue potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
