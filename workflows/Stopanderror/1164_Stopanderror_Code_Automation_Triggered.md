# Stopanderror Code Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, code, crypto.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute Workflow Trigger**.
2. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "554.4117841902089", height: "278.2403290971726"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "359.58396920054975", height: "548.3119898759418"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "300.4638046519632", height: "360.20237540316725", content: "## Error Output
If the signature cannot be verified, an error will be raised. You can manage this scenario in your main workflow by either using an Error Workflow or by modifying y…[truncated]"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "300.4638046519632", height: "427.3843805720155", content: "## Success Output
If the signature is successfully verified, we return a key `verified_signature` set to `true` along with the data from the Slack request itself.
"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "300.4638046519632", height: "427.3843805720155", content: "## Input
The input should be the received Slack request. Place this workflow directly after the Slack Webhook.
"
8. **Make Slack Verif Token** `code` — jsCode: "function encodeFormData(data) {
  const encodedData = Object.keys(data)
    .map(key => encodeURIComponent(key) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(data[key]))
    .join('&')
    .replaceAl…[truncated]"
9. **Encode Secret String** `crypto` — type: "SHA256", value: "={{ $json.sigBaseString }}", action: "hmac"
10. **IF** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **Set Verified to True** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", include: "none", options: "[object Object]"
12. **Stop and Error** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "Could not verify Slack Webhook signature"
13. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "mergeByPosition"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow verifies that a message received from a Slack Webhook is authentic by checking its signature. It creates a signature base string from the request data, encodes it using a secret key with SHA256, and compares it to the signature sent by Slack. If they match, it confirms the message's authenticity; otherwise, it raises an error.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to ensure that only legitimate messages from Slack Webhooks are processed, enhancing security by preventing unauthorized or spoofed messages from triggering automated actions in their system.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure your Slack Signing Secret in the workflow.
3. Place this workflow after a Slack Webhook trigger.
4. Test the workflow with a valid Slack Webhook request to see the verification process in action.

### Practice
Create a test Slack app, set up a Webhook, and send test requests to your n8n instance. Observe how the workflow processes valid requests and raises errors for invalid ones. Modify request data to see how changes affect verification.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer secure Slack integrations to clients, ensuring that only verified messages are processed. This adds value to your services, attracting clients who prioritize security and reliability in their automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
