## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Run workflow every hours** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
5. **Sticky Note20** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "250", height: "1390"
6. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "247", height: "1391"
7. **Sticky Note15** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "219", height: "220"
8. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "247", height: "1391"
9. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "3060", height: "880"
10. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "3060", height: "500"
11. **Settings** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **GS - Get Zip Codes** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
13. **Zips** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
14. **Filter Zips** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
15. **Set Row Number** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
16. **Split Out** `splitOut` — include: "allOtherFields", options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "row_number"
17. **Limit** `limit` — maxItems: "3"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates lead generation using Google Maps data. It retrieves zip codes from Google Sheets, queries Google Maps API for businesses in specific subcategories, and updates Google Sheets with the results. It includes error handling and exponential backoff to manage API limits.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to gather potential leads by finding businesses within specific categories and zip codes. This helps in targeting marketing efforts effectively, saving time compared to manual research.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Google Maps API credentials.
3. Set up a trigger (manual or scheduled) to run the workflow.
4. Configure the Google Sheets document and subcategories.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is collected and updated correctly.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with a list of zip codes and subcategories. Run the workflow to extract business data from Google Maps API and verify the results in your Google Sheet. Adjust zip codes or subcategories and observe the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer lead generation services, providing clients with targeted business data. This can enhance your offerings, attract new customers, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleOAuth2Api, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
