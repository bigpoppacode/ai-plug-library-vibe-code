# Stopanderror ClickUp Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Create tasks** `toolWorkflow` — name: "create_task", schemaType: "manual", workflowId: "[object Object]"
5. **Create follow-up call** `microsoftOutlookTool` — resource: **event**, operation: **create**
6. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1000", height: "280", content: "## Sub workflow: Create Task in ClickUp"
8. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "660", height: "520", content: "## Welcome to my Zoom AI Meeting Assistant Workflow!

### This workflow has the following sequence:

1. manual trigger (Can be replaced by a scheduled trigger or a webhook)
2. retr…[truncated]"
9. **Zoom: Get data of last meeting** `zoom` — operation: **getAll**
10. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "query.items"
11. **Filter: Last 24 hours** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **ClickUp** `clickUp` — list: "901207046581", name: "={{ $json.name }}", team: "9012366821"
13. **Zoom: Get transcripts data** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.zoom.us/v2/meetings/{{ $json.id }}/recordings`
14. **Filter transcript URL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **No Recording/Transcript available** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "={{ $json.error.cause.message }}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating meeting summaries and follow-up tasks from Zoom meetings. It retrieves recent Zoom meeting data, extracts transcripts, and uses OpenAI to summarize the meeting. It then creates tasks in ClickUp and schedules follow-up calls in Outlook, ensuring all meeting actions are tracked and organized.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline meeting management, ensuring all meeting details are captured, summarized, and action items are tracked, reducing manual effort and improving productivity.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Zoom, OpenAI, ClickUp, and Outlook accounts.
3. Set up a trigger to run the workflow after each meeting.
4. Ensure your Zoom meetings have transcripts available.
5. Test the workflow to verify that summaries and tasks are correctly generated.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Zoom meeting with a few participants. Record the meeting and ensure a transcript is generated. Run the workflow and check if the meeting summary and tasks are created correctly in ClickUp and Outlook.

**WIIFM (What's In It For Me):**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer comprehensive meeting management solutions to clients, enhancing their efficiency. By automating follow-ups and task creation, you can save time, reduce errors, and increase client satisfaction, potentially boosting your automation business revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, zoomOAuth2Api, smtp, microsoftOutlookOAuth2Api, clickUpOAuth2Api.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
