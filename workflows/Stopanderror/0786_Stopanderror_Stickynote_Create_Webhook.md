## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow processes Ko-fi payment webhooks. It starts with a webhook that receives payment data, verifies the token for authenticity, and then categorizes the payment as a donation, subscription, or shop order. The workflow logs these details and checks if a subscription is new.

### Demonstrate
A content creator using Ko-fi to receive payments can use this workflow to categorize and handle incoming payments automatically, ensuring accurate records and triggering follow-up actions like sending thank-you emails or granting membership access.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook URL in Ko-fi and add it to the Webhook node.
3. Insert your verification token in the Prepare node.
4. Test the workflow using Ko-fi's webhook testing feature.
5. Customize actions for donations, subscriptions, and orders as needed.

### Practice
Create a mock Ko-fi account and simulate a payment. Use the Ko-fi webhook testing feature to send a test payload to your n8n webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the data and verify that it accurately logs and categorizes the payment.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate payment processing for clients, reduce manual data entry, and enhance customer interactions. This skill can increase your value as an automation consultant, leading to new opportunities and increased income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
