# Stopanderror Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×9, supabase×6, httpRequest×4.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note8**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "872", height: "97"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "211", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — content: "[redacted]"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "995", height: "82"
6. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — content: "You can also use SET NODE + tobase64 function as done in step 2"
7. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1644", height: "80"
8. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — width: "668", content: "[redacted]"
9. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — width: "1413", content: "[redacted]"
10. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — height: "248", content: "A 3rd partyapplication posting the request to the webhook"
11. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/937a8843-a28a-400a-b473-bdc598366fa0`
12. **Receive request** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/47704458-bfa6-4d95-adf1-97fc78e35d8a`
13. **catch Auth code** `webhook` — path: `/aae545fb-a69d-4e20-91ce-65f105d0ea2f`
14. **Supabase- look for the record** `supabase` — operation: **get**, table: `App_tok`
15. **convert clientId and secret to base64** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
16. **combine client id and secret** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **Generate Refresh Token from authcode** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `[redacted]`
18. **Get Pipedrive acess token** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `[redacted]`
19. **Look for the related record in Supabase** `supabase` — operation: **get**, table: `App_tok`
20. **IF success** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
21. **IF rec not found** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
22. **Update thr row with new access token** `supabase` — operation: **update**, table: `App_tok`
23. **Stop and Error** `stopAndError` — errorMessage: "[redacted]"
24. **Insert** `supabase` — table: `App_tok`
25. **Update tokns in the record** `supabase` — operation: **update**, table: `App_tok`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of refreshing OAuth 2.0 tokens for Pipedrive. It starts by checking if a refresh token exists in a Supabase database. If a token is invalid, it regenerates a new one using stored credentials and updates the database with the new access and refresh tokens. This ensures continuous access to Pipedrive without manual intervention.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner using Pipedrive for CRM may need this workflow to automatically refresh tokens, ensuring uninterrupted data access for sales reports or customer management, without manual token updates.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Supabase and Pipedrive accounts in n8n.
3. Set up webhooks to receive requests and catch auth codes.
4. Customize database fields to match your setup.
5. Test the workflow to ensure tokens refresh correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Supabase table with sample tokens. Run the workflow to see how it updates the tokens upon expiration. Modify token values to simulate expiration and observe the workflow's response.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated OAuth token management services, ensuring clients' systems remain operational without manual token handling, thereby increasing service reliability and client satisfaction. This can enhance your automation business offerings and open up new revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** supabaseApi, httpBasicAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
