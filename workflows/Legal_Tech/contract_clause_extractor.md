# Contract Clause Extractor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Contract Clause Extractor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/contract_clause_extractor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "contract_clause_extractor"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "contract_clause_extractor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow is designed to extract clauses from contracts. It starts by receiving contract data through a webhook. The data is split into chunks and processed to generate embeddings, which are inserted into a vector store called Weaviate. The workflow queries the vector store to retrieve relevant clauses and uses an AI chat model to refine results. Finally, it logs the extracted clauses into a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate**  
A legal tech company might use this workflow to automate the extraction of specific clauses from large volumes of contracts, saving time and reducing manual errors in legal document review.

**Imitate**  
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive contract data.  
2. Use a splitter to divide the text into manageable chunks.  
3. Generate embeddings via Cohere and store them in Weaviate.  
4. Query Weaviate to retrieve relevant data.  
5. Use OpenAI to refine the results and log them into Google Sheets.  

**Practice**  
Create a test contract with simple clauses. Run the workflow to see how it extracts and logs the clauses. Modify the contract and observe changes in the workflow output.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable resource in the legal industry, offering automated document analysis services. This can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and open up new revenue streams in AI-driven legal tech solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
