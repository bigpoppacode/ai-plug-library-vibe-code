# Nda Risk Detector
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## NDA Risk Detector", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/nda_risk_detector`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "nda_risk_detector"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "nda_risk_detector"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow serves as an NDA Risk Detector. It starts by receiving NDA documents through a webhook. These documents are split into manageable chunks and embedded using Hugging Face embeddings. The data is stored in a Redis vector database and queried to identify potential risks. An AI agent, configured with OpenAI, evaluates the document's risk level and sends the findings to a Google Sheet for logging. This process ensures efficient risk detection in NDA documents, aiding in compliance and risk management.

### Demonstrate
A legal consultancy could use this workflow to automatically assess NDAs for potential risks, saving time and reducing human error in legal document reviews.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive NDA documents.
3. Connect Redis, Hugging Face, and OpenAI accounts.
4. Configure a Google Sheet for logging results.
5. Test with sample NDA documents to ensure accurate risk detection.

### Practice
Create a test NDA document, run it through the workflow, and check the Google Sheet for risk assessment results. Modify the document to introduce risks and observe how the workflow identifies them.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated legal risk assessments as a service, enhancing your consulting offerings and increasing client value. This can lead to more clients and higher revenue in legal tech solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, redisApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
