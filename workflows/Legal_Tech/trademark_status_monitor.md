# Trademark Status Monitor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Trademark Status Monitor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/trademark_status_monitor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "trademark_status_monitor"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "trademark_status_monitor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the monitoring of trademark statuses. It starts with a POST request via a webhook that receives data about trademarks. The data is split and processed into embeddings using Hugging Face. These embeddings are inserted into a Pinecone vector store for storage and queried for further actions. The processed data is then analyzed by an AI agent, and the results are recorded in a Google Sheet for logging and tracking purposes. This ensures efficient monitoring and logging of trademark status updates.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor trademark applications and receive updates or alerts on their status, ensuring they remain informed and can take timely action if needed.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the webhook to receive trademark data.
3. Connect Pinecone and Hugging Face accounts.
4. Configure the Google Sheet for logging.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is processed and logged correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test trademark data set and simulate a POST request to the webhook. Verify that the data is processed and logged in the Google Sheet, and adjust any configurations as needed.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated trademark monitoring services, adding value for clients who need to track their intellectual property. This can expand your service offerings and generate additional income in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, pineconeApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
