3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/case_law_summarizer`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "case_law_summarizer"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "case_law_summarizer"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
The Case Law Summarizer workflow automates the process of summarizing legal case documents. It begins by receiving case data via a webhook, which is then split into manageable chunks. These chunks are converted into embeddings using Cohere and stored in a Supabase vector database. The workflow queries this database to retrieve relevant information, which is then processed by an AI agent using OpenAI to generate a summary. The final summary is appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate:**  
A law firm could use this workflow to quickly summarize lengthy legal documents, allowing lawyers to focus on case strategy rather than administrative tasks, thus saving time and increasing productivity.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Supabase, OpenAI, and Google Sheets accounts.  
3. Set up the webhook to receive case data.  
4. Test the workflow with sample legal documents.  
5. Verify that summaries are correctly generated and saved in Google Sheets.

**Practice:**  
Create a test case document with multiple sections. Run the workflow to observe how it splits, processes, and summarizes the content. Adjust chunk sizes and overlap to see their impact on the summary quality.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer efficient legal document summarization services, reducing manual labor and providing high-value automation solutions that can attract law firms as clients, boosting your business offerings and income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
