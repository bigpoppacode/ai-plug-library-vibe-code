# Legal Billing Analyzer
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Legal Billing Analyzer", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/legal_billing_analyzer`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "legal_billing_analyzer"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "legal_billing_analyzer"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to analyze legal billing data. It starts with a webhook that receives data, which is then split into chunks and converted into embeddings using Cohere's model. These embeddings are stored in a Redis vector database. The workflow uses Anthropic's language model to analyze the data, and results are appended to a Google Sheet for logging.

### Demonstrate
A law firm could use this workflow to automate the analysis of billing data, ensuring accuracy and compliance. It helps in identifying discrepancies and optimizing billing processes, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive billing data.
3. Connect your Redis, Cohere, Anthropic, and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Customize the splitter and embedding settings.
5. Run the workflow to ensure data is processed and logged correctly.

### Practice
Create a sample webhook to send test billing data to the workflow. Observe how the data is split, analyzed, and stored. Modify the data to see how the workflow handles different inputs and verify the results in Google Sheets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated billing analysis services to law firms, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy. It opens up opportunities to attract legal clients, offering a high-value service that can generate substantial income for your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, redisApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
