# Privacy Policy Generator
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Privacy Policy Generator", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/privacy_policy_generator`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "privacy_policy_generator"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "privacy_policy_generator"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the generation of privacy policies. It begins by receiving data through a webhook. The data is split into manageable chunks and processed to create embeddings using Cohere. These embeddings are stored in Redis and queried to fetch relevant information. An AI agent then uses this information to generate a privacy policy, which is logged in a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate:**  
A startup founder can use this workflow to quickly generate privacy policies tailored to their business needs, ensuring compliance without spending hours drafting or hiring legal experts.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.  
2. Set up your webhook to receive input data.  
3. Connect your Redis and Cohere API credentials.  
4. Configure the Google Sheets node with your sheet details.  
5. Run the workflow to test it with sample input data.

**Practice:**  
Create a test scenario where you input different business details into the webhook. Observe how the AI agent generates a privacy policy and logs it in Google Sheets. Adjust input data to see variations in policy output.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer privacy policy generation as a service, helping businesses comply with legal requirements efficiently. This can open new revenue streams and enhance your automation service portfolio, attracting more clients.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, redisApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
