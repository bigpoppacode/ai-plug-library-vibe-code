  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

  2. **ActiveCampaign Trigger** `activeCampaignTrigger` — events: "account_add", sources: "admin"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automatically notify users when a new account is added by an admin in ActiveCampaign. It uses an ActiveCampaign Trigger node that listens for the "account_add" event specifically from the "admin" source. When this event occurs, it can be configured to trigger subsequent actions, such as sending notifications or updating databases.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep their team informed whenever a new customer account is created by an admin in ActiveCampaign, ensuring immediate follow-up actions are taken to onboard the new customer efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up the ActiveCampaign Trigger node, ensuring you have the necessary credentials.
3. Define the actions to take place after an account is added, such as sending an email or updating a CRM.
4. Test the workflow by adding a new account in ActiveCampaign and observe the triggered actions.

### Practice
Create a test account in ActiveCampaign to see how the workflow triggers and handles the event. Experiment by adding conditions or additional nodes to extend the workflow's functionality, such as logging the event in a Google Sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate customer onboarding processes, enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. It can help you offer advanced automation solutions to clients, increasing your value as a consultant and potentially generating more income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** activeCampaignApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
