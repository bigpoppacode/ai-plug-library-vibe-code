# Googlecalendartool ExecuteWorkflow Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using googleCalendarTool×5, set×2, lmChatOpenAi.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When Executed by Another Workflow**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **Create Event with Attendee** `googleCalendarTool` — calendar: "[object Object]", start: "={{ $fromAI("eventStart") }}", end: "={{ $fromAI("eventEnd") }}"
4. **Create Event** `googleCalendarTool` — calendar: "[object Object]", start: "={{ $fromAI("eventStart") }}", end: "={{ $fromAI("eventEnd") }}"
5. **Get Events** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **getAll**
6. **Delete Event** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **delete**
7. **Update Event** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **update**
8. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
9. **Calendar Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json.query }}", options: "[object Object]"
10. **Success** `set` — assignments: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **Try Again** `set` — assignments: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow acts as a calendar management assistant using AI to handle tasks like creating, updating, and deleting events in a Google Calendar. It interacts with the OpenAI model to understand and process calendar-related queries, and uses various nodes to manage events and attendees, ensuring efficient and automated calendar operations.

**Demonstrate:** A consultant managing multiple client meetings could use this workflow to automate scheduling tasks, reducing manual input and errors, and ensuring all events are correctly logged and updated.

**Imitate:** To adapt this workflow: 1) Import it into n8n. 2) Connect your Google Calendar. 3) Set up triggers for when another workflow calls this one. 4) Customize AI prompts for specific calendar tasks. 5) Test with sample data to ensure accuracy.

**Practice:** Create a test workflow that triggers this calendar agent workflow to schedule a meeting. Verify the event is created in your Google Calendar and test updating or deleting it through the workflow.

**WIIFM:** By mastering this workflow, you can offer calendar automation services to clients, saving them time and reducing scheduling errors. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and open opportunities for additional automation services, boosting your income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
