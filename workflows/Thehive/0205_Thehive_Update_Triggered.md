# Thehive Update Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using theHiveTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **TheHive Trigger**.
2. **TheHive Trigger** `theHiveTrigger` — events: "*"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automatically notify users when any event occurs in TheHive, a security incident response platform. It uses a TheHive Trigger node that listens for all types of events, such as case creation, task updates, or alert modifications, and initiates the workflow whenever an event is detected.

### Demonstrate
A cybersecurity team might use this workflow to stay updated on all activities within TheHive. For instance, when a new security incident is reported, the team could be immediately notified, allowing them to respond promptly and efficiently to potential threats.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your TheHive account to the workflow.
3. Set the TheHive Trigger node to listen for the desired events.
4. Customize the workflow to specify how notifications should be sent (e.g., email, Slack).
5. Activate the workflow and test by creating a test event in TheHive.

### Practice
Create a test event in TheHive, such as adding a new case or updating a task. Observe how the workflow triggers in response and ensure the notification is delivered as expected. Modify the trigger settings to see how different events are handled.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can enhance your cybersecurity services, offering clients real-time incident alerts and faster response times. This capability can lead to improved client satisfaction and open opportunities for offering advanced security monitoring solutions, potentially increasing your revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
