  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling new leads. It starts by capturing lead information from a Typeform submission, sets the values, and creates a new contact in HubSpot. If the lead is interested in scaling visual content, it updates their lifecycle stage to "opportunity" and sends them a personalized email via Gmail, inviting them to schedule a call and learn more about services.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to streamline their lead management process, ensuring that interested leads receive timely follow-ups and are properly categorized in their CRM, improving the efficiency of their sales pipeline.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Typeform, HubSpot, and Gmail accounts.
3. Set up the Typeform with relevant questions.
4. Customize email content in the Gmail node.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a Typeform entry.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform with your contact information and run it through the workflow. Verify that the contact is created in HubSpot and check your email for the personalized response. Adjust any fields as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you efficiently manage leads, ensuring prompt follow-ups and organized CRM data. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and potentially increase your income by providing high-value lead management services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** hubspotApi, typeformApi, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
