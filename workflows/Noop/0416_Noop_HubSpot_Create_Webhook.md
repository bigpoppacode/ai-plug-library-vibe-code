  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow is designed to enhance new contacts in HubSpot by adding detailed information from ExactBuyer. When a new contact is created in HubSpot, the workflow retrieves the contact's details, checks if an email is found, and then sends a request to the ExactBuyer API to enrich the contact with additional data such as social profiles, contact information, and location. If successful, the enriched data is updated back in HubSpot; if not, the workflow can handle the absence of data gracefully.

**Demonstrate**  
A business might use this workflow to automatically enrich their CRM database with detailed customer information, improving marketing and sales efforts by having a more comprehensive view of each contact.

**Imitate**  
1. Set up OAuth2 credentials in n8n for HubSpot and ExactBuyer.
2. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
3. Connect HubSpot and ExactBuyer accounts.
4. Customize the fields and API keys as needed.
5. Activate the workflow to start enriching new contacts automatically.

**Practice**  
Create a test contact in HubSpot and observe how the workflow enriches the contact with data from ExactBuyer. Modify the contact's email and re-test to see how the workflow handles different scenarios.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer enhanced CRM data management services, increasing the quality of customer interactions and potentially boosting sales. This skill can differentiate you as a consultant in the automation space, leading to more business opportunities and increased income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, hubspotOAuth2Api, hubspotDeveloperApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
