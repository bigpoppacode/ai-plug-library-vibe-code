  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the collection and processing of product feedback. It starts by triggering on new submissions from a Typeform survey, capturing the respondent's name, email, score, and additional comments. The data is then saved into an Airtable database. If the feedback score is 7 or higher, the workflow creates a Trello card for further review. Otherwise, the feedback is marked as processed without additional action.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer feedback collection, automatically sorting valuable insights for team review, and ensuring quick response to high-scoring feedback.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform, Airtable, and Trello accounts.
3. Customize the Typeform fields and Airtable table to match your feedback form.
4. Set up Trello to receive cards for high scores.
5. Test the workflow with sample feedback entries.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform survey and run the workflow. Submit feedback with varying scores to see how the workflow processes and routes the data. Check Airtable for records and Trello for high-score notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer feedback management solutions to businesses, helping them improve customer satisfaction and enhance products. This can boost your service offerings and create new revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, airtableApi, trelloApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
