# Noop Stickynote Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×7, set×5, lmChatOpenAi×4.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Switch Model** `code` — code: "[object Object]", inputs: "[object Object]", outputs: "[object Object]"
4. **OpenAI 4o-mini** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
5. **OpenAI 4o** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
6. **OpenAI o1** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
7. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
8. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "480", height: "140", content: "### Customer complaint - example

I really *love* waiting two weeks just to get a keyboard that doesn’t even work. Great job. Any chance I could actually use the thing I paid for s…[truncated]"
9. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "240"
10. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "200"
11. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "260"
12. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "240"
13. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "220"
14. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "240"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow dynamically switches between different Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses to received chat messages. It starts by capturing a chat message and setting an index for the LLM to use. The selected LLM generates a response, which is then validated and possibly retried with a different model if errors occur. The workflow ensures the best model is used for generating customer support responses.

### Demonstrate
A customer service department could use this workflow to handle customer complaints more effectively by utilizing the best-suited AI model to generate appropriate responses, thereby improving customer satisfaction and response efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the LLM nodes with your OpenAI credentials.
3. Set up a chat trigger to receive messages.
4. Adjust the code node to handle your specific LLM indices.
5. Test with sample chat inputs to ensure responses are generated and validated correctly.

### Practice
Create a test scenario where you simulate receiving a customer complaint and observe how the workflow switches models to generate and validate a response. Modify the LLM index manually to understand its effect on the response quality.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer advanced customer support solutions, enhancing client satisfaction and opening opportunities to offer premium AI automation services. This can lead to increased business value and potential income growth in your AI automation ventures.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
