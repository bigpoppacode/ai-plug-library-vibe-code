# Noop Github Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using if×3, github×3, githubTrigger×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Assign Commenter**.
  2. **Assign Commenter** `github` — operation: **edit**

  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates issue assignment on GitHub. When a new issue or comment is detected, it checks if the issue is unassigned and if the commenter requests assignment ("assign me"). If so, it assigns the issue to the commenter or the issue creator, ensuring issues are quickly addressed and organized.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing an open-source project can use this workflow to streamline issue management by automatically assigning issues to contributors who express interest, thus maintaining an organized and efficient workflow without manual oversight.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub account and set the repository details.
3. Define the trigger events (e.g., new issue/comment).
4. Customize the regex pattern if needed for different assignment requests.
5. Test the workflow with sample issues and comments.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository. Add issues and comments with "assign me" requests. Run the workflow to see how it automatically assigns the issues. Experiment with different request formats to refine the regex pattern.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you offer efficient project management solutions to clients, enhancing their open-source or internal projects' efficiency. It positions you as a valuable resource in automation, potentially increasing your service offerings and client base.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
