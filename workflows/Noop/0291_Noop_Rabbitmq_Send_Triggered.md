# Noop Rabbitmq Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using rabbitmqTrigger, if, vonage.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **NoOp**.
  2. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ## Explain
This workflow listens for messages in a RabbitMQ queue and checks if a specific value, "temp," is greater than 50. If it is, an SMS alert is sent using Vonage to notify about the high value. If the condition is not met, no action is taken.

## Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to monitor temperature sensors in a warehouse. If the temperature exceeds a safe threshold, an alert is sent to the manager to take immediate action.

## Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your RabbitMQ and Vonage accounts.
3. Set your queue name and SMS message details.
4. Test the workflow with different "temp" values to ensure alerts are sent correctly.

## Practice
Create a test RabbitMQ queue with temperature data. Use the workflow to trigger SMS alerts when the temperature exceeds 50. Experiment with different values to see how the workflow behaves.

## WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time monitoring and alerting services to clients. This can improve their operational efficiency, prevent potential issues, and increase your value as an automation expert.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** rabbitmq, vonageApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
