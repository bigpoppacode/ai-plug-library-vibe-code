# Noop Twilio Send Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using cron, coinGecko, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **NoOp**.
  2. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow checks the price of Bitcoin in Euros every minute using CoinGecko. If the price is 9000 EUR or higher, it sends an SMS alert via Twilio. If the price is below 9000 EUR, it performs a NoOp (no operation), which essentially means nothing happens.

**Demonstrate**  
A cryptocurrency trader could use this workflow to receive real-time alerts when Bitcoin's price hits a certain threshold, allowing them to make timely trading decisions.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your CoinGecko and Twilio credentials.  
3. Set your phone numbers in the Twilio node.  
4. Activate the workflow to start monitoring Bitcoin prices.  
5. Test by temporarily lowering the threshold to ensure alerts work.

**Practice**  
Create a similar workflow to monitor another cryptocurrency or stock price. Adjust the threshold and use a different notification method, like email, to test your understanding.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer real-time monitoring services to clients, enhancing their trading strategies and potentially increasing their profits. This skill can be a valuable service in the financial tech space, boosting your income opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** twilioApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
