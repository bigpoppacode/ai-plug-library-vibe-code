# Noop Twilio Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Send SMS**.
  2. **Send SMS** `twilio` — to: "={{$node["Personalize Message"].json["Phone Number"]}}", from: "", message: "={{$node["Personalize Message"].json["Wishes"]}}"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the sending of personalized congratulatory SMS messages. Every day at 8 AM, it checks a Google Sheets calendar for any events occurring that day. If an event is found, it retrieves the corresponding messages and phone numbers from another Google Sheet, personalizes the message using the recipient's first name, and sends it via SMS using Twilio.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically send birthday or anniversary messages to customers, enhancing customer relations and potentially increasing customer loyalty.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Twilio accounts.
3. Set up the daily trigger and ensure your Google Sheets contain the necessary data.
4. Customize the message template in the "Personalize Message" node.
5. Test the workflow to verify it sends SMS messages correctly.

### Practice
Create a test event in your Google Sheets calendar for today's date, and add a corresponding message and phone number. Run the workflow manually to see how it personalizes and sends the SMS. Adjust the message template and test again.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer personalized communication services to businesses, helping them engage with customers effectively. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and open opportunities for upselling additional automation solutions, boosting your income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, twilioApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
