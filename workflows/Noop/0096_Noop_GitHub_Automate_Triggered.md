# Noop Github Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using if×3, github×3, noOp×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Github Trigger1**.
  2. **Github Trigger1** `githubTrigger` — owner: "harshil1712", events: "issue_comment,issues", repository: "build-discord-bot"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**  
  This n8n workflow automates the process of assigning GitHub issues. It triggers when an issue or comment is created in a specified repository. If an issue is opened with no assignee and contains "assign me" in its body, it assigns the issue to the creator. Similarly, if someone comments "assign me" on an issue, it assigns the commenter if the issue is unassigned. If the issue is already assigned, it comments back to inform the commenter.

- **Demonstrate**  
  A software development team could use this workflow to streamline their GitHub issue management. It ensures that issues are automatically assigned to the right person, reducing administrative overhead and speeding up the development process.

- **Imitate**  
  1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
  2. Connect your GitHub account using OAuth2.
  3. Set up the GitHub Trigger with your repository details.
  4. Customize the regex patterns or logic as needed.
  5. Activate the workflow to start automating issue assignments.

- **Practice**  
  Create a test GitHub repository and use this workflow to manage issues. Open issues and comment “assign me” to see how the workflow assigns them. Modify the workflow to handle more complex assignment rules.

- **WIIFM**  
  Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated GitHub management services, improving efficiency for development teams. This can help you attract tech-savvy clients and expand your automation business by offering tailored solutions that save time and reduce manual workload.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
