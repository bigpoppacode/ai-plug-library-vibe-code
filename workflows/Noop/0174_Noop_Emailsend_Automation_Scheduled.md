# Noop Emailsend Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Check Daily at 11:AM**.
  2. **Check Daily at 11:AM** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to motivate users to maintain an active lifestyle by monitoring their daily activity on Strava. Every day at 11 AM, it retrieves activity data from Strava. If the user's moving time is below the set threshold (30 minutes), an email is sent to their accountability partners, encouraging them to motivate the user to be more active.

### Demonstrate
A fitness coach could use this workflow to ensure clients are meeting their daily activity goals. If a client hasn't been active enough, the coach's team gets notified to provide encouragement, helping clients stay on track with their fitness plans.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Strava and email accounts.
3. Set up the accountability partners' email addresses in the workflow.
4. Test the workflow by simulating a day with low activity to ensure emails are sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Strava account and simulate a few days of activity data. Run the workflow to see how it detects inactivity and sends emails. Adjust the activity threshold to see how it affects the email triggers.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer personalized fitness accountability services, tracking clients' progress and providing timely encouragement. This can enhance client satisfaction and retention, adding value to your fitness coaching business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** stravaOAuth2Api, smtp.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
