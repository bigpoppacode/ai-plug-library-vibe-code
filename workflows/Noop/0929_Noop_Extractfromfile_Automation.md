  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Email trigger** `emailReadImap` — format: "resolved", options: "[object Object]", postProcessAction: "nothing"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "200", content: "### Change or add any category you want
Each category can be assigned it's own specific workflow"
4. **OpenAI Chat Model 2** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
5. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
6. **Extract data from attachment** `extractFromFile` — operation: **pdf**
7. **Classify email** `textClassifier` — options: "[object Object]", inputText: "={{ $('Email trigger').first().json.text }}

attachment:
{{ $('Extract data from attachment').first().json.text }}
", categories: "[object Object]"
8. **Extract variables - email & attachment** `informationExtractor` — text: "={{ $('Email trigger').first().json.text }}

Resume:
{{ $('Extract data from attachment').first().json.text }}
", options: "[object Object]", attributes: "[object Object]"
9. **Workflow 2** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
10. **Workflow 3** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
11. **workflow 4** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email processing by triggering on new emails, extracting content from attachments, and classifying emails into categories like job applications or invoices using an AI model. It then extracts specific details from the emails and attachments for further processing, organizing the information efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically sort incoming job applications from their email, extract key applicant information, and categorize them for easy access and review, saving time and ensuring no application is overlooked.

### Imitate
1. Set up an IMAP email account in n8n.
2. Import the workflow and connect your OpenAI account.
3. Define email categories and extraction details.
4. Customize the workflow with additional nodes for further processing.
5. Test with sample emails to ensure accurate classification and data extraction.

### Practice
Create a test email account and send emails with PDF attachments. Run the workflow to see how it categorizes emails and extracts data. Modify the categories and extraction parameters to see how changes affect the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer email automation services, enhancing client productivity by reducing manual email sorting and data entry. This can lead to increased efficiency, better client relationships, and added revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
