# Noop HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using noOp×9, httpRequest×6, if×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Enable Throttle**.
  2. **Enable Throttle** `httpRequest` — url: `=http://{{$node["Global Variables"].json["qbittorent"]["internalIP"]}}:{{$node["Global Variables"].json["qbittorent"]["port"]}}/api/v2/transfer/toggleSpeedLimitsMode`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow is designed to manage the download speed of a qBittorrent client based on media playback activity from Plex. When media is played, paused, or stopped, the workflow adjusts the download speed limits. It does this by receiving a webhook from Plex, checking if the media is being played locally, and then toggling the speed limits on the qBittorrent client accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A media server administrator could use this workflow to ensure smooth streaming experiences for users. When someone starts streaming a movie, the torrent download speed is throttled to prevent buffering, and when playback stops, the speed is restored.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Plex server to send webhooks to this workflow.
3. Configure the qBittorrent details (IP, port, username, password) in the Global Variables node.
4. Test the workflow by playing, pausing, and stopping media on Plex to see if the torrent speed adjusts.

### Practice
Create a test environment with a Plex server and qBittorrent client. Simulate media playback scenarios to observe how the workflow throttles download speeds. Adjust settings to ensure optimal performance during streaming.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer a valuable service to clients with media servers, ensuring seamless streaming without interruptions. This expertise can help you attract media server administrators looking to optimize their systems, potentially leading to consulting opportunities or subscription-based service offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
