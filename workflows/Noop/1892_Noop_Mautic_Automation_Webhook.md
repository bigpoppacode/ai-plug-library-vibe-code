  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of capturing form submissions from a WordPress site, processing the data, and creating a contact in Mautic. It starts by receiving form data via a webhook, normalizes this data, and checks the validity of the email address. If the email is valid, a new contact is created in Mautic with the provided information. If not, the contact is marked as "Do Not Contact" in Mautic to prevent further communication errors.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically add new leads from their website to their Mautic CRM, ensuring that only valid email addresses are processed, which helps maintain a clean and effective contact list.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a WordPress form with relevant fields.
3. Connect the webhook to your form.
4. Configure the Mautic node with your Mautic credentials.
5. Test the workflow by submitting the form and checking Mautic for new contacts.

### Practice
Create a sample WordPress form and use the workflow to submit a few test entries. Modify some email addresses to be invalid and observe how the workflow handles these cases in Mautic.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
