  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the screening of CVs for a software engineer position. When a candidate submits an application form, the workflow extracts the PDF CV, analyzes it using AI for compatibility with the job description, and rates the candidate. The results are saved in a Google Sheet, and emails are sent to HR and the candidate acknowledging receipt and providing the AI's assessment.

**Demonstrate:**  
A tech company could use this workflow to streamline their recruitment process, ensuring each CV is consistently evaluated against job requirements, saving HR time and improving candidate experience.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the application form and connect Google Sheets and Gmail.
3. Customize the AI prompts for your job description.
4. Test the workflow with sample submissions to ensure it functions correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test form for a different job role, adjust AI analysis prompts, and see how the workflow can be adapted to various positions. Observe the changes in the Google Sheet and email notifications.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer efficient HR automation solutions, enhancing hiring processes for businesses. This can lead to new client acquisition and increased revenue by reducing manual work and improving candidate selection accuracy.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googlePalmApi, gmailOAuth2, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
