# Form Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using form×4, httpRequest×2, if×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On form submission**.
  2. **On form submission** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Post Publisher", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1380", height: "680", content: "[redacted]"

9. **Result Video** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Success Photo?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]", looseTypeValidation: "true"
11. **Success Video?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]", looseTypeValidation: "true"
12. **OK Photo** `form` — operation: **completion**

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the publishing of social media content. When a user submits a form with a photo or video, the workflow determines the media type and uploads it to a specified platform using Upload-post.com. It then checks if the upload was successful, notifying the user of the outcome.

**Demonstrate:** A content creator can use this workflow to streamline their social media posting process. By automating media uploads across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn, they save time and ensure timely content distribution.

**Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n, connect your Upload-post.com account, and customize the form fields to match your social media accounts. Set up the API key as described in the sticky notes, and test the workflow by submitting a form with an image or video.

**Practice:** Create a test form with one image and one video, then run the workflow to see how it handles each file type. Check the success and error notifications to understand the workflow's response to different scenarios.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated social media management services, appealing to businesses and creators looking to enhance their online presence. This can increase your client base and revenue in the digital marketing space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
