# Form HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using formTrigger, set, function.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **YoutubeVideoURL**.
  2. **YoutubeVideoURL** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Youtube Video Transcriber", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **extractTranscript** `httpRequest` — url: `https://youtube-transcript3.p.rapidapi.com/api/transcript`
4. **processTranscript** `function` — functionCode: "// Extract and process the transcript
const data = $input.first().json;

if (!data.transcript && !data.text) {
  return {
    json: {
      success: false,
      message: 'No trans…[truncated]"
5. **cleanedTranscript** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting and cleaning transcripts from YouTube videos. It starts with a form where users input a YouTube video URL. The workflow then sends a request to an API to fetch the video's transcript. Once retrieved, a function processes the transcript by cleaning up the text (removing extra spaces and normalizing punctuation) and stores the cleaned version for further use or analysis.

### Demonstrate
A content creator could use this workflow to quickly generate transcripts of their YouTube videos for accessibility purposes or to create written content from video material, enhancing engagement and reach.

### Imitate
1. Import this workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a form trigger to capture YouTube URLs.
3. Connect to the YouTube transcript API with your API key.
4. Customize the function node to meet your specific transcript formatting needs.
5. Test with different YouTube video URLs to ensure proper transcript extraction and cleaning.

### Practice
Create a test form in n8n to collect YouTube URLs, then run the workflow with a sample URL. Observe how the transcript is processed and cleaned. Modify the function node to apply different text processing rules and see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer transcript extraction and cleaning services to content creators, improving their content accessibility and repurposing capabilities. This can broaden your service offerings and increase revenue in an AI-driven automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
