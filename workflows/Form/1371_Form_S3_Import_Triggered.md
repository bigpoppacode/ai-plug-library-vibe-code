  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of uploading a file submitted through a form to a Digital Ocean Spaces bucket. When a user submits a form with a file, the workflow triggers and uploads the file to a designated S3 bucket. After the upload, it sends a completion message with a public URL to access the uploaded file, ensuring a seamless file handling experience.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to allow customers to submit files directly through their website, automatically storing them in a secure cloud location. This is particularly useful for collecting documents, images, or media files for processing or review.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a form with a file upload field.
3. Connect to your Digital Ocean Spaces account.
4. Customize the bucket name and form details as needed.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a file through the form.

### Practice
Create a simple form with different file types and test the workflow to see how it handles various file sizes and formats. Adjust the bucket settings and test the public access URL functionality to ensure secure file sharing.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline file collection and storage processes, offering value-added services to clients who need efficient file management solutions. This could lead to new business opportunities in digital asset management and secure file handling, enhancing your service portfolio in the automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
