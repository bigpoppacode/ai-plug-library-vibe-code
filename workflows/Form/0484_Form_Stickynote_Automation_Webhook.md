# Form Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, formTrigger, nasa.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **n8n Form Trigger**.
  2. **n8n Form Trigger** `formTrigger` — path: `/da4071f2-7550-4dae-aa48-8bced4291643`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "322", height: "564"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "319", content: "User submits an API key using the form"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "319", content: "The workflow passes the key to the NASA node. You can reference the value using the expression `$json["Enter your NASA API key"]`. This is also available to the node credential. "
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — height: "319", content: "The Respond to Webhook node controls the form response (in this example, redirecting the user to an image)"
7. **NASA** `nasa` — additionalFields: "[object Object]"
8. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", redirectURL: "={{ $json.url }}", respondWith: "redirect"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow allows users to dynamically set credentials for accessing NASA's API by submitting an API key via a form. Once the key is submitted, the workflow triggers the NASA node to retrieve data, such as the NASA picture of the day. Finally, it redirects the user to the image using a webhook response.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to create a public form where users submit their NASA API keys to view daily space images. This offers a personalized user experience while demonstrating dynamic credential handling.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a NASA API key and enable expressions.
3. Configure the form to accept API keys.
4. Test the workflow by submitting an API key through the form.
5. Verify that it redirects to the NASA picture of the day.

### Practice
Create a test form on n8n to capture API keys. Use the workflow to display NASA's picture of the day based on user input. Experiment with incorrect API keys to see how the workflow handles errors.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer dynamic credential handling solutions, enhancing user interaction and personalization. This skill can attract clients needing custom API integrations, increasing your service range and potential income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** nasaApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
