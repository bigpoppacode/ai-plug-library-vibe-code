  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Waitlist Form**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "740", height: "520", content: "## Adding to GSheet-List, Creating a OTP / Verification Code

"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "480", height: "360"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "680", height: "480"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "640", height: "340"
6. **Waitlist Form** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Waitlist Form", formFields: "[object Object]"
7. **Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "668", height: "786", content: "## Instructions

8. **Clean and Standardize** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
9. **Generate Random Verification Code** `crypto` — action: "generate", encodingType: "hex", stringLength: "6"
10. **Add  to Waitlist Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **appendOrUpdate**
11. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "chooseBranch", useDataOfInput: "2"
12. **Send Verification Email** `emailSend` — html: "=Hey {{ $json.Firstname }}

Thank you for your interest in joining the white list. To complete your registration, please verify your email address by using the code provided below:…[truncated]", options: "[object Object]", subject: "Your Waitlist Verification Code"

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of managing a waitlist via Google Sheets. It collects user information through a form, generates a verification code, and sends it via email. Users then verify their email by entering the code. The workflow updates the Google Sheet with the user's verification status and any additional information provided.

**Demonstrate:** A startup launching a new product could use this workflow to manage a waitlist, ensuring only verified users are added. This helps maintain an organized list, improving communication and planning for product launches.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and email accounts.
3. Set up a form to collect user data.
4. Customize the email content and Google Sheet columns.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a form entry and verifying the process.

**Practice:** Create a test Google Sheet with columns for user information and verification status. Run the workflow with sample data to see how it updates the sheet, and adjust the form fields or email content to fit your needs.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you efficiently manage user sign-ups, improving client onboarding processes. Offering this as a service can increase your value in automation, potentially leading to more clients and higher income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, smtp.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
