# Form HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Landing Page Url**.
  2. **Landing Page Url** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Conversion Rate Optimizer", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Scrape Website** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json['Landing Page Url'] }}`
5. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "=You are a professional expert in Conversion Rate Optimization who helps business founders & CMOs improve their landing pages. You are a world-class expert in analysing landing pag…[truncated]", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow helps business owners improve their landing pages by analyzing their content for conversion rate optimization (CRO). Users submit a landing page URL, which the workflow scrapes for content. An AI agent, acting as a CRO expert, evaluates the page, providing a detailed "roast" (critical analysis) and 10 specific, creative recommendations to enhance conversion rates.

**Demonstrate**  
A business consultant could use this workflow to audit client landing pages, identifying weaknesses and recommending improvements to increase customer engagement and sales conversions.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.  
2. Connect your OpenAI account.  
3. Set the form to capture landing page URLs.  
4. Test by submitting a URL and reviewing the AI's analysis and recommendations.  
5. Customize recommendations based on your industry expertise.

**Practice**  
Create a test landing page with known issues. Run the workflow to receive the AI's analysis. Adjust the page based on the recommendations, then test again to see if the suggestions improve the page's effectiveness.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer a unique CRO service to clients, helping them increase sales and engagement. This expertise can expand your business offerings, attract new clients, and boost your income by providing high-value, automated insights into marketing strategies.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
