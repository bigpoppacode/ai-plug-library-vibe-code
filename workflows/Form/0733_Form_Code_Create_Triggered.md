# Form Code Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using googleDrive×4, stickyNote×4, code×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On form submission**.
  2. **On form submission** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Batch File Upload to Google Drive", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "520", height: "520"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "460", height: "380"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "360", height: "200"
6. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "660", height: "280"
7. **Get Folder Name** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Search specific folder** `googleDrive` — resource: **fileFolder**
9. **Folder found ?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **Prepare Files for Upload** `code` — jsCode: "let results = [];
const items = $("On form submission").all()

for (item of items) {
    for (key of Object.keys(item.binary)) {
        results.push({
            json: {
        …[truncated]"
11. **Create Folder** `googleDrive` — resource: **folder**
12. **Upload Files** `googleDrive` — name: "={{ $json.fileName }}", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
13. **Prepare Files for New Folder** `code` — jsCode: "let results = [];
const items = $("On form submission").all()

for (item of items) {
    for (key of Object.keys(item.binary)) {
        results.push({
            json: {
        …[truncated]"
14. **Upload to New Folder** `googleDrive` — name: "={{ $json.fileName }}", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of uploading multiple files to a specified Google Drive folder. When a user submits a form with files and a target folder name, the workflow checks if the folder exists in Google Drive. If it doesn't, the folder is created. All files are then uploaded to the folder, maintaining their original names and structure.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner can use this workflow to streamline document management. For example, a real estate agency could use it to upload property images and documents directly to Google Drive, organizing them into client-specific folders automatically.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance. 2. Connect your Google Drive account. 3. Adjust the form fields to match your file upload requirements. 4. Test the form to ensure files are uploaded correctly. 5. Set the workflow to active.

**Practice:** Create a test form with a few sample files and a specified folder name. Run the workflow to see if it creates the folder and uploads the files correctly. Try different folder names to ensure the folder creation logic works.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient file management solutions to clients, reducing manual effort and increasing productivity. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and potential revenue growth in your automation services business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
