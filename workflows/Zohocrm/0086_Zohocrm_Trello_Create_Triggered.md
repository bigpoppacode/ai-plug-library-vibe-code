# ZohoCRM Trello Create Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Harvest**.
2. **Harvest** `harvest` — resource: **invoice**, operation: **create**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This n8n workflow automates several tasks triggered by a new order in Shopify. It collects customer details and order information, updates the contact in Zoho CRM, creates an invoice in Harvest, and logs the order in Trello. If the order value exceeds $50, it sends a thank-you email with a coupon to the customer and tags them in Mailchimp as a "high-order" customer. If not, a simple thank-you email is sent.

**Demonstrate**: A business owner with an online store could use this workflow to streamline order processing and customer engagement, ensuring high-value customers receive exclusive offers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Imitate**: 1. Import the workflow to n8n. 2. Connect Shopify, Zoho, Harvest, Trello, Gmail, and Mailchimp accounts. 3. Customize the nodes to match your business needs (e.g., email templates, CRM fields). 4. Test the workflow with sample orders.

**Practice**: Create a test Shopify store and simulate orders. Observe how the workflow updates CRM, creates invoices, and sends emails. Adjust conditions and templates to see different outcomes based on order value.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can help you automate e-commerce operations, enhancing efficiency and customer interactions. Offering such solutions to other businesses can expand your service offerings and generate additional revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** zohoOAuth2Api, trelloApi, gmailOAuth2, mailchimpApi, shopifyApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
