  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **New webinar booking via JotForm**.
  2. **New webinar booking via JotForm** `jotFormTrigger` — form: "250054687472360"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "839.0148942368631", height: "1288.9426551387483", content: "### Introduction
This workflow streamlines the process of handling webinar registrations submitted via JotForm. It ensures the data is correctly formatted and seamlessly integrates…[truncated]"
4. **Convert and set webinar data** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Subscribe contact in KlickTipp** `klicktipp` — resource: **subscriber**, operation: **subscribe**
6. **Get list of all existing tags** `klicktipp` — configured for its default action.
7. **Define Array of tags from Jotform** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Split Out Jotform tags** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "tags"
9. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combineBySql", query: "SELECT 
    input1.tags AS name,  -- Extracts the tag name from input1
    IF(input2.value IS NOT NULL, true, false) AS exist, -- Checks if the tag exists in input2 (returns true i…[truncated]"
10. **Tag creation check** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **Aggregate tags to add to contact** `aggregate` — options: "[object Object]", fieldsToAggregate: "[object Object]"
12. **Create the tag in KlickTipp** `klicktipp` — operation: **create**
13. **Tag contact directly in KlickTipp** `klicktipp` — resource: **contact-tagging**
14. **Aggregate array of created tags** `aggregate` — options: "[object Object]", fieldsToAggregate: "[object Object]"
15. **Tag contact KlickTipp after trag creation** `klicktipp` — resource: **contact-tagging**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow automates webinar registration data processing from JotForm, ensuring it's correctly formatted and integrated into KlickTipp. It triggers on new form submissions, transforms the data, subscribes the contact to KlickTipp, checks for existing tags, creates new ones if needed, and tags the contact accordingly.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner hosting webinars can use this to automatically process registrations, ensuring participants receive timely follow-ups and personalized communication, enhancing customer engagement and reducing manual data handling.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect JotForm and KlickTipp accounts.  
3. Customize field mappings to fit your form and subscriber list.  
4. Set up the workflow trigger for form submissions.  
5. Test with a sample form submission to verify data processing and tagging.

**Practice**  
Create a test JotForm and submit a few entries. Watch how the workflow processes each entry, subscribes the contact, and applies tags in KlickTipp. Experiment with different tag conditions to see how the workflow adapts.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can streamline your event management processes, allowing you to offer automated registration and follow-up services to clients. This can enhance your business's efficiency, attract more customers, and open up new revenue streams in AI automation solutions.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
