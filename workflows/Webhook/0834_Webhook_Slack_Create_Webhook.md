# Webhook Slack Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Search All Outlook Events** `microsoftOutlookTool` — resource: **event**
4. **Create New Calendar Event** `microsoftOutlookTool` — resource: **event**, operation: **create**
5. **Get Available Calendars** `microsoftOutlookTool` — resource: **calendar**
6. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $json.ts }}_{{ $json.user }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "720", content: "### This n8n template demonstrates how easy it is to build an Outlook Calendar Assistant powered by an AI agent equipped with Tools.

n8n's AI agents makes it easy to build powerfu…[truncated]"
8. **On BOT/APP Mention** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/c63b08ce-360d-4185-aae1-294afef5cf2b`
9. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "180"
10. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "540", height: "220"
11. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "400", height: "200"
12. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "440", height: "340"
13. **Is Auth Challenge?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **Respond to Challenge** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.body.challenge }}"
15. **Get Message** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
16. **Outlook Calendar Assistant** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.message.substr($json.message.indexOf('>')+1, 9999).trim() }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
17. **Send Reply** `slack` — text: "={{ $json.output }}", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This n8n workflow acts as an Outlook Calendar Assistant powered by an AI agent. It listens for mentions of a bot in a Slack channel, processes the message using AI to understand calendar-related inquiries, and interacts with Microsoft Outlook to search for events, create new calendar events, or retrieve available calendars. The AI agent then formulates a response which is sent back to the Slack channel, providing users with a seamless way to manage their Outlook calendars through Slack.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner can use this workflow to streamline scheduling by allowing employees to quickly check their calendars or schedule meetings via Slack, reducing the need to switch between applications.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n, connect Slack and Outlook accounts, set up the Slack bot to listen for mentions, and customize the AI agent's response logic to fit your team's needs. Test by mentioning the bot in Slack with a calendar query.

- **Practice:** Create a test Slack channel, mention the bot with a query like "What meetings do I have today?" and observe how the workflow processes and responds. Experiment with creating a new event via Slack to see the workflow in action.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer AI-driven calendar management solutions to businesses, enhancing productivity and communication. This skill can help you attract clients looking for efficient, integrated scheduling solutions, thereby increasing your income potential in the AI automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, microsoftOutlookOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
