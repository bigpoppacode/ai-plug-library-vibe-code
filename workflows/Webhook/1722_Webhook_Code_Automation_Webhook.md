# Webhook Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using code×6, set×6, readWriteFile×5.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **Webhook** at `POST` **/docu-digi-sign**.
2. **API POST Endpoint** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/docu-digi-sign`
3. **API GET Endpoint** `webhook` — path: `/docu-download`
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "740", height: "440", content: "# Cryptographic Operations
## Generate Certificate and  Sign PDF"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "740", height: "320", content: "# Document Management
## Download document
"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1380", height: "620", content: "# Document Management
## Upload Certificate and Upload PDF
"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "740", height: "840"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "680", height: "560"
9. **set file path** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
10. **Switch Operation** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **Prepare input params** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
12. **Validate Key Gen Params** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
13. **Validate PDF Sign Params** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
14. **set downlowd file info** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Switch Upload Type** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
16. **Generate Keys** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
17. **Sign PDF** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
18. **Read download file from Disk** `readWriteFile` — options: "[object Object]", fileSelector: "={{ $json.fullFileName }}"
19. **Validate PDF Upload** `code` — jsCode: "// Check required parameters for PDF upload
const requiredParams = ['fileData'];

let missingParams = [];
for (const param of requiredParams) {
  if (!$input.item.json[param]) {
  …[truncated]"
20. **Validate Key Upload** `code` — jsCode: "// Check required parameters for key upload
const requiredParams = ['fileData'];

let missingParams = [];
for (const param of requiredParams) {
  if (!$input.item.json[param]) {
  …[truncated]"
21. **GET Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "binary"
22. **Convert PDF to File** `convertToFile` — operation: **toBinary**
23. **Convert PFX to File** `convertToFile` — operation: **toBinary**
24. **Write PDF File to Disk** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
25. **Write PFX File to Disk** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
26. **Read PDF File from Disk** `readWriteFile` — options: "[object Object]", fileSelector: "={{ $json.fileName }}"
27. **Read PFX File from Disk** `readWriteFile` — options: "[object Object]", fileSelector: "={{ $json.fileName }}"
28. **Check PDF file is OK** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
29. **Check PFX file is OK** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
30. **check success** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
31. **Prepare Success Response** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
32. **POST Error Response** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]"
33. **POST Success Response** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This n8n workflow is designed to handle digital document signing processes. It allows users to upload PDFs and certificates, generate cryptographic keys, and sign PDFs digitally. The workflow involves two endpoints: one for uploading documents and another for downloading them. It checks for required parameters, writes files to disk, performs cryptographic operations, and returns the results.

**Demonstrate**: A legal firm might use this workflow to automate the signing of contracts. When a new contract is received, it can be uploaded, signed with a digital certificate, and then downloaded, ensuring quick and secure processing of legal documents.

**Imitate**: 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your storage for PDFs and certificates.
3. Set up the POST endpoint for uploading documents.
4. Configure the cryptographic operations with your certificate details.
5. Test the workflow by uploading a PDF to be signed.

**Practice**: Create a test PDF and try uploading it through the POST endpoint. Check if the PDF is signed and available for download correctly. Experiment with different file types to see how the workflow handles them.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer digital signing services, which can be a valuable addition to businesses needing secure document processing. This can attract clients in legal, finance, or any field requiring authenticated document handling, thereby expanding your service offerings and potentially increasing your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Expose Webhook:** Map your external app to the listed path/method; test with curl/Postman before activation.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
