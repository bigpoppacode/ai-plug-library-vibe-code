# Webhook SIGNL4 Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using theHive×2, signl4×2, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **SIGNL4 Resolve Alert**.
2. **SIGNL4 Resolve Alert** `signl4` — operation: **resolve**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle security alerts from TheHive, a security incident response platform. It creates an alert in TheHive, checks if the alert is not closed, and if so, sends a notification to SIGNL4, a mobile alerting app. Once the alert is resolved, it marks the alert as resolved in SIGNL4. This ensures timely and efficient handling and resolution of security issues.

### Demonstrate
A security operations center (SOC) could use this workflow to automate the management of security alerts, ensuring that every alert is promptly handled and resolved, reducing response times and improving security posture.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your TheHive and SIGNL4 accounts.
3. Set the webhook to receive alerts from TheHive.
4. Customize message templates for alerts.
5. Test the workflow by creating a sample alert in TheHive.

### Practice
Create a test alert in TheHive and observe how it triggers the workflow, sending a notification via SIGNL4. Then, resolve the alert and see how the workflow updates SIGNL4 to reflect the resolution.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated alert management services, enhancing security operations for clients. This can increase your service offerings, improve client satisfaction, and boost your income potential in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** theHiveApi, signl4Api.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
