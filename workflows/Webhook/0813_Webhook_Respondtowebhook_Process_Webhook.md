## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **Webhook** at `POST` **/526fd864-6f85-4cde-97aa-39b61a3e5b83**.
2. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/526fd864-6f85-4cde-97aa-39b61a3e5b83`
3. **Set data** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
4. **Preprocess** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "const input = $input.item.json
const bill_to = input['Bill To'].split('\n').map(item => '<p>' + item + '</p>')
const from = input['From'].split('\n').map(item => '<p>' + item + '</…[truncated]"

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Invoice</title>

6. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "binary"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating an invoice in PDF format. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, setting initial data like invoice number and customer details, and preprocessing this information to format it into HTML. The HTML is then converted into a PDF using the HTML to PDF node, and the resulting PDF file is sent back as a response to the webhook.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to automatically generate invoices for customers after a purchase is made on their website, streamlining their billing process and ensuring consistency and professionalism in their invoicing.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your webhook and configure the URL path.
3. Customize the "Set data" node with your invoice details.
4. Test the workflow by triggering the webhook with sample data.
5. Ensure the PDF is generated and returned correctly.

### Practice
Create a test webhook in n8n and simulate an invoice request by sending sample data. Observe how the workflow processes the data and generates a PDF. Modify the HTML template to include a company logo or change styles to match your brand.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated invoicing solutions to clients, enhancing their operational efficiency. This capability can boost your service offerings, attract more clients, and potentially increase your revenue in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** customJsApi.
2. **Expose Webhook:** Map your external app to the listed path/method; test with curl/Postman before activation.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
