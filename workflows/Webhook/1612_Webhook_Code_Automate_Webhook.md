# Webhook Code Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note4**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "400", height: "500", content: "## Prepare data
**- Get content image from Line** 
https://api-data.line.me/v2/bot/message/xxx/content

**- Get image URL to Binary**"
3. **Line Chat Bot** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/23ba996d-3242-42a1-946c-f04a680b320a`
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "220", height: "500"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "540", height: "500"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "220", height: "500"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "220", height: "500"
8. **Image slip URL in Line** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Get image to Binary** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.file_url }}`
10. **Upload image to Google Drive** `googleDrive` — name: "={{ $('Line Chat Bot').item.json.body.events[0].message.id }}.jpg", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **Send Image URL to OCR Space for Text Extraction** `httpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`
12. **Extract Transaction Details** `code` — jsCode: "const text = $json["ParsedResults"][0]["ParsedText"];

// Split text by line breaks and trim spaces
const lines = text.split("\n").map(line => line.trim());

// Debugging: Log extr…[truncated]"
13. **Record in Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting transaction details from images sent via a LINE chat bot. It begins by receiving image data through a LINE webhook, then converts the image to binary format and uploads it to Google Drive. The image URL is sent to an OCR service to extract text, from which transaction details like type, date, sender, receiver, amount, and transaction ID are parsed. These details are then recorded in a Google Sheets document for easy tracking and analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically process payment receipts sent by customers over LINE, making it easier to track transactions and maintain accurate financial records without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a LINE chat bot webhook to receive images.
3. Configure Google Drive and Sheets nodes with your credentials.
4. Test the workflow with a sample image to ensure text extraction and data recording work correctly.

### Practice
Create a test environment where you send an image of a receipt through your LINE bot. Run the workflow to see how the transaction details are extracted and recorded in Google Sheets. Adjust the OCR parsing logic if some details are not captured correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer automated transaction processing services to businesses, reducing manual workload and improving data accuracy. This can lead to new service offerings, attracting clients who need efficient financial data management solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, googleDriveOAuth2Api, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
