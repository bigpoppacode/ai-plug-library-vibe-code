## üöÄ What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

4. **Analyze user request** `openAi` ‚Äî resource: **chat**, prompt: "[object Object]", model: `gpt-4`
5. **Parse JSON** `set` ‚Äî values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
6. **Select category** `switch` ‚Äî rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{ $json.gpt_reply.category.toLowerCase() }}", dataType: "string"
7. **User Success Dept** `discord` ‚Äî text: "={{ $json.gpt_reply.instruction }}", options: "[object Object]", webhookUri: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<YOUR WEBHOOK HERE>"
8. **IT Dept** `discord` ‚Äî text: "={{ $json.gpt_reply.instruction }}", options: "[object Object]", webhookUri: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<YOUR WEBHOOK HERE>"

## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the classification and handling of user feedback. When feedback is submitted via a webhook, it is analyzed by OpenAI's GPT-4 model to determine its category: "success-story," "urgent-issue," or "ticket." Based on this classification, the feedback is routed to the appropriate department on Discord‚ÄîCustomer Success, IT, or Helpdesk‚Äîensuring that each piece of feedback is addressed by the correct team.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer feedback management, ensuring urgent issues are promptly addressed by the IT department, while success stories are shared with the Customer Success team to enhance morale and customer relationships.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive feedback.
3. Connect OpenAI and Discord accounts.
4. Define categories and corresponding Discord webhooks.
5. Test by submitting feedback to see how it's categorized and routed.

### Practice
Create a sample feedback form and submit different types of feedback. Observe how each is categorized and routed to the correct department, and adjust the workflow if necessary to ensure accurate classification.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a powerful customer feedback automation service, enhancing client satisfaction and operational efficiency. This capability can lead to increased customer retention, additional service offerings, and potential income growth in your AI automation business.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
