# Webhook Graphql Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, noOp, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **Webhook** at `POST` **/3041fdd6-4cb5-4286-9034-1337dddc3f45**.
2. **Call from Baserow** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/3041fdd6-4cb5-4286-9034-1337dddc3f45`
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "360.408084305475", height: "315.5897364788551"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "331.1188177339898", content: "## Shopify 
The n8n Shopify node cannot upload images or theme assets so we need to make custom calls to the GraphQL and REST Api "
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "158.16682590559316", content: "## Set values 
Please edit this node and change the values for your own setup."
6. **Set values here!** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
7. **Check** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Upload Image** `graphql` — query: "mutation fileCreate($files: [FileCreateInput!]!) {
  fileCreate(files: $files) {
    files {
      id
    }
  }
}", endpoint: "=https://{{ $('Set values here!').params["fields"]["values"][0]["stringValue"] }}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/graphql.json", variables: "={
  "files": {
    "alt": "{{ $json.body.items[0].Name }}",
    "contentType": "IMAGE",
	"filename": "{{ $json.body.items[0]['Campaign Image'][0].visible_name }}",
    "originalSo…[truncated]"
9. **No Operation, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
10. **Save campaign.liquid** `httpRequest` — method: **PUT**, url: `=https://{{ $('Set values here!').params["fields"]["values"][0]["stringValue"] }}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-01/themes/{{ $('Set values here!').params["fields"]["values"][1]["str…[truncated]`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of uploading images to a Shopify store. It begins with a webhook triggered by Baserow, which sends data about a campaign. The workflow checks if the campaign data has changed and if it is active. If these conditions are met, it uses Shopify's GraphQL API to upload an image and then updates the Shopify theme with the new image reference using a REST API call.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update their Shopify store's theme with new promotional images whenever a marketing campaign is updated in their database, ensuring their store always reflects the latest branding.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook in Baserow to send campaign updates.
3. Edit the "Set values here!" node to include your Shopify subdomain and theme details.
4. Test the workflow by updating a campaign in Baserow to see if the image is uploaded and the theme is updated.

### Practice
Create a test campaign in Baserow with an image URL. Trigger the workflow by updating the campaign, and observe whether the image uploads to your Shopify store and updates the theme. Adjust the workflow to handle different image formats or additional campaign data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer Shopify automation services, saving clients time on manual updates. This can enhance your service offerings, attract new customers, and increase revenue in your automation business by providing seamless e-commerce solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, shopifyAccessTokenApi.
2. **Expose Webhook:** Map your external app to the listed path/method; test with curl/Postman before activation.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
