## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of identifying new job intents from a webhook and managing potential sales opportunities. It starts by receiving job intent data via a webhook. The workflow uses Dropcontact to enrich contact details and searches HubSpot for existing company records. It updates or creates accounts in HubSpot, manages contacts, and triggers follow-up tasks. It evaluates whether the company is a new lead, customer, or has open deals, and accordingly notifies the sales and customer success teams via Slack. If an email is found, it adds the lead to a Lemlist campaign and initiates LinkedIn outreach.

**Demonstrate**  
A sales team could use this workflow to automatically manage job intent leads, ensuring timely follow-ups and organized data in HubSpot. It improves efficiency by automating lead enrichment and task creation, thus increasing the team's ability to close deals faster.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your HubSpot, Dropcontact, Slack, and Lemlist accounts.  
3. Set up the webhook to receive job intent data.  
4. Customize the HubSpot and Slack nodes with your team's specifics.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it handles leads as expected.

**Practice**  
Create a mock job intent submission and run it through the workflow. Check how the data is processed, updated in HubSpot, and how notifications are sent via Slack. Adjust the workflow to suit different lead scenarios, such as missing email or different lead statuses.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate and optimize lead management processes, which can significantly enhance your team's productivity.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
