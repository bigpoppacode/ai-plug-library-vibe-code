# Webhook Filemaker Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using respondToWebhook×2, filemaker×2, stickyNote×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "## Script Parameter
Passes the record id as script parameter to be used in your processWebhook script"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "158.74371859296477", height: "121.3065326633166", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Xero Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/4cf50a61-b550-4ee6-984d-ad8c94e2b5c2`
5. **Move Binary Data** `moveBinaryData` — options: "[object Object]", setAllData: "false", destinationKey: "raw_data"
6. **Set** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
7. **Crypto** `crypto` — type: "SHA256", value: "={{$json["source_data"]}}", action: "hmac"
8. **IF** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
9. **Success** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "noData"
10. **Unauthorised** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "noData"
11. **Create webhook record** `filemaker` — action: "create", layout: "Webhooks", fieldsParametersUi: "[object Object]"
12. **Perform processWebhook script** `filemaker` — action: "performscript", layout: "Webhooks", script: "processWebhook"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow in n8n listens for incoming webhooks from Xero, processes the data using cryptographic validation to ensure authenticity, and then logs the information into a FileMaker database. If the validation is successful, it records the webhook data and triggers a script for further processing; if not, it sends an unauthorized response.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to securely process financial data from Xero, ensuring that only verified data is logged and processed. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and automating accounting tasks.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Xero webhook to send data to n8n.
3. Configure the Crypto node with your secret for validation.
4. Connect FileMaker credentials for data logging.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it records only authorized entries.

### Practice
Create a test webhook in Xero and execute the workflow. Check if only valid, authenticated data is recorded in the FileMaker database. Modify the Crypto node's secret to see how unauthorized data is handled.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow ensures secure data handling, which can attract clients seeking reliable automation for financial operations. Offering such services can enhance your credibility and expand your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** fileMaker.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
