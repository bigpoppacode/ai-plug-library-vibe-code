# Webhook Respondtowebhook Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using httpRequest×5, respondToWebhook, switch.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
2. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/MaskedEmail`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "810.0000000000002", height: "1181.829268292685", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Session** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/session`
5. **Switch** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
6. **create random masked email** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/api/`
7. **delete** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/api/`
8. **disabled** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/api/`
9. **get all masked emails** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.fastmail.com/jmap/api/`
10. **gather masked email list** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **create html template** `html` — html: "<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Masked Email Addresses</tit…[truncated]"
12. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.html }}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow manages Fastmail masked email addresses using the Fastmail API. It listens for incoming requests via a webhook, retrieves session data, and processes commands to create, update, delete, or list masked emails based on the input state. It then generates an HTML table to display the masked email data and responds to the webhook with this table.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the management of masked email addresses for privacy-focused applications, ensuring that email addresses are created, updated, or deleted based on user actions, while maintaining an up-to-date list accessible via a simple HTML interface.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Fastmail API credentials.
3. Configure the webhook to listen for specific actions.
4. Test the workflow by sending requests with different states (e.g., create, delete).
5. Verify the HTML table output displays the correct masked email data.

### Practice
Create a test environment with Fastmail credentials. Use a tool like Postman to send POST requests to the webhook with different email states. Observe the resulting HTML table to ensure it accurately reflects the masked email actions taken.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email management solutions, enhancing privacy and efficiency for clients who need to handle numerous email aliases. This can expand your service offerings and increase client satisfaction, leading to potential new income streams in AI automation businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, httpBasicAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
