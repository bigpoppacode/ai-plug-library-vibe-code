# Webhook Respondtowebhook Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, embeddingsOpenAi×2, vectorStoreQdrant×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On new manual Chat Message**.
2. **Embeddings OpenAI1** `embeddingsOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **On new manual Chat Message** `manualChatTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "903.0896125323785", height: "733.5099670584011"
5. **Vector Store Retriever** `retrieverVectorStore` — topK: "5"
6. **Webhook1** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/19f5499a-3083-4783-93a0-e8ed76a9f742`
7. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
8. **Binary to Document** `documentBinaryInputLoader` — loader: "pdfLoader", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Recursive Character Text Splitter** `textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` — options: "[object Object]", chunkSize: "3000", chunkOverlap: "200"
10. **Embeddings OpenAI** `embeddingsOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
11. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "772.0680602743597", height: "732.3675002130781"
12. **Qdrant Vector Store1** `vectorStoreQdrant` — qdrantCollection: "[object Object]"
13. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
14. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "710.9124489067698", height: "726.4452519516944"
15. **Retrieval QA Chain** `chainRetrievalQa` — query: "={{ $json.body.input }}"
16. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
17. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.response.text }}"
18. **Qdrant Vector Store** `vectorStoreQdrant` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", qdrantCollection: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow, named "Stock Q&A Workflow," processes PDF documents from Google Drive by extracting and storing their content in a vector database for efficient retrieval. When a user submits a query via a webhook, the workflow retrieves relevant document chunks from the vector store, uses an OpenAI model to generate a response, and then sends back the response through the webhook. This enables dynamic, document-based Q&A functionality.

**Demonstrate**  
A company could use this workflow to provide customer support, where users submit questions about product manuals stored as PDFs. The system retrieves relevant information from these documents and provides accurate answers quickly.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Google Drive and OpenAI accounts.  
3. Set up the Google Drive node to download PDFs.  
4. Configure the webhook for receiving queries.  
5. Test the workflow with sample queries to ensure accurate responses.

**Practice**  
Create a Google Drive folder with sample PDF documents. Use the workflow to extract and store document content in the vector database. Send test queries via the webhook and observe how the workflow retrieves and responds with the relevant information.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer document-based Q&A services, enhancing customer support for businesses. This capability can differentiate your services, attract new clients, and potentially increase revenue by offering advanced automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleDriveOAuth2Api, qdrantApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
