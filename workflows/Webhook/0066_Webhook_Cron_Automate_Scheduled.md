# Webhook Cron Automate Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using httpRequest×7, function×7, executeWorkflow×4.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Every hour**.
2. **Every hour** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing standup meetings in Mattermost. It triggers every hour to check if any standups are due, sends reminders to participants, and collects their updates. Users can configure standup settings via slash commands, and the workflow handles the creation and updating of standup reports in Mattermost channels.

**Demonstrate:**  
A team manager could use this workflow to automate daily standup meetings, ensuring that all team members provide their updates on time, and the reports are automatically published in the designated Mattermost channels.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Mattermost account.  
3. Configure the cron schedule to match your standup times.  
4. Set up Mattermost channels and users in the configuration.  
5. Test the workflow by running a mock standup session.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Mattermost channel and add a few users. Run the workflow to see how it sends reminders and collects updates. Modify standup settings using slash commands and observe the changes in the workflow execution.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated standup management services to teams, improving their productivity and communication. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** mattermostApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
