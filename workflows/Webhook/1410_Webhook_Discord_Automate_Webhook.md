Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

4. **Analyze user request** `openAi` ‚Äî resource: **chat**, prompt: "[object Object]", model: `gpt-4`
5. **Parse JSON** `set` ‚Äî values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
6. **Select category** `switch` ‚Äî rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{ $json.gpt_reply.category.toLowerCase() }}", dataType: "string"

## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the categorization and routing of user feedback received via a webhook. It uses OpenAI to analyze the feedback, categorizing it into "success-story," "urgent-issue," or "ticket." Based on the category, it sends instructions to the relevant department (User Success, IT, or Helpdesk) using Discord webhooks, ensuring timely and appropriate response to feedback.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer feedback management, ensuring that positive feedback is shared with the User Success team, urgent issues are escalated to IT, and other queries are handled by the Helpdesk, improving response efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive feedback data.
3. Connect OpenAI and Discord accounts.
4. Customize the Discord webhook URIs for your departments.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample feedback through the webhook.

### Practice
Create a test feedback form and connect it to the workflow. Submit different types of feedback to see how they are categorized and routed. Adjust the OpenAI prompt or Discord messages to better fit your organization's communication style.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated feedback management services to clients, enhancing their customer service capabilities. This can attract new clients and generate recurring income through automation service contracts.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
