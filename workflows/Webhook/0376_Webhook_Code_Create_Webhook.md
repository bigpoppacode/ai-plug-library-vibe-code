# Webhook Code Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
2. **ReceiveTfsPullRequestCreatedMessage** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/pr-notify-template`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "484", height: "540", content: "## Send DingTalk message on new Azure DevOps Pull Request
This template automates sending a DingTalk message on new Azure Dev Ops Pull Request Created Events. It uses a MySQL datab…[truncated]"
4. **LoadDingTalkAccountMap** `mySql` — operation: **select**, table: `[object Object]`
5. **BuildDingTalkWebHookData** `code` — jsCode: "// Code here will run only once, no matter how many input items there are.
// More info and help: https://docs.n8n.io/nodes/n8n-nodes-base.function

console.log("items:");
console.…[truncated]"
6. **SendDingTalkMessageViaWebHook** `httpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automatically sends a notification via DingTalk whenever a new pull request is created in Azure DevOps. It begins with a webhook capturing the pull request event, retrieves user mapping data from a MySQL database, processes the data to format the message, and finally sends the notification to the appropriate users on DingTalk.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to ensure that all team members are promptly notified of new pull requests, facilitating quicker code reviews and collaboration, thereby streamlining the development process.

### Imitate
1. Set up an Azure DevOps Service Hook to trigger the webhook on pull request creation.
2. Create a MySQL table for user mapping between Azure and DingTalk.
3. Configure the n8n nodes: Webhook, MySQL, Code, and HTTP Request.
4. Customize the message content as needed.
5. Test the workflow by creating a pull request in Azure DevOps.

### Practice
Create a test pull request in Azure DevOps and observe how the workflow processes the event, retrieves user data, formats the message, and sends the notification. Adjust user mapping or message formatting and test again to see the changes take effect.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help automate communication within development teams, improving efficiency and reducing response times for code reviews. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** mySql.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
