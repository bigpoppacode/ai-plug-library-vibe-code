# Webhook Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow converts text notes from Obsidian into audio files using OpenAI's text-to-speech capabilities. It then stores these audio files in Cloudinary and generates an RSS feed for a podcast. The workflow uses Google Sheets to manage podcast metadata, ensuring episodes are correctly formatted and available for podcast platforms.

**Demonstrate:**  
A content creator could use this workflow to transform their written notes into a podcast format, making their content accessible in audio form for audiences who prefer listening over reading.

**Imitate:**  
1. Install the Post Webhook Plugin in Obsidian.
2. Set up n8n with your OpenAI and Cloudinary credentials.
3. Configure Google Sheets to store podcast metadata.
4. Trigger the workflow via Obsidian to convert notes to audio.
5. Check the RSS feed URL to access the podcast.

**Practice:**  
Create a short note in Obsidian and run the workflow. Verify the note conversion to audio and its appearance in the podcast feed. Experiment with different notes to see how they are transformed into podcast episodes.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer podcast creation services, expanding your business offerings. You can cater to clients looking to reach broader audiences through audio content, potentially increasing your revenue by tapping into the growing podcast market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, httpCustomAuth, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
