# Discordtool Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Discord MCP Server Trigger**.
  2. **Send Discord Message to Channel** `discordTool` — resource: **message**
3. **Add Role To Member** `discordTool` — resource: **member**, operation: **roleAdd**
4. **Remove Role from member** `discordTool` — resource: **member**, operation: **roleRemove**
5. **Discord MCP Server Trigger** `mcpTrigger` — path: `/404f083e-f3f4-4358-83ef-9804099ee253`
6. **Get channels of server by server ID** `discordTool` — operation: **getAll**
7. **Get members of server by server ID** `discordTool` — resource: **member**
8. **Send DM and Wait for reply** `discordTool` — resource: **message**, operation: **sendAndWait**
9. **Send to Channel and Wait for Reply** `discordTool` — resource: **message**, operation: **sendAndWait**
10. **Send DM to User** `discordTool` — resource: **message**
11. **Get Discord Server IDs** `httpRequestTool` — url: `https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me/guilds`
12. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "600", content: "

Programmatic role addition and removal are just two examples of the many, many tools/API calls that you can make to Discord.

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to automate interactions within a Discord server. It can send messages to a channel, add or remove roles for members, send direct messages (DMs) to users, and manage server data. It also retrieves server IDs and lists all channels and members in a server. The workflow is triggered by a specific event on the Discord server.

**Demonstrate:** A community manager could use this workflow to automate welcoming new members by sending them a DM, assigning them a role, and posting a welcome message in a channel. This ensures a smooth onboarding process and saves time.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Discord bot credentials.
3. Set up the trigger for specific server events.
4. Define roles and messages for different actions.
5. Test the workflow with a dummy server to ensure it operates as expected.

**Practice:** Create a Discord server and set up this workflow to send a welcome message to new members. Experiment with role assignments and channel messages to understand how each node functions.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer Discord server management services to communities, enhancing their engagement and automation. This can help you attract clients looking to streamline their online community operations, potentially generating income from setup and maintenance services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** discordBotApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
