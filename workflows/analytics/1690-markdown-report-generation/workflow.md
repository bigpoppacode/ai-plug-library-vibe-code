## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, itemLists, markdown.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: SortElements (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Markdown (markdown)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: CreateMDReport (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Send Email (emailSend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: GetImg (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: ImgBinary (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Merge2 (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the generation and emailing of a timesheet report. It collects timesheet records, sorts them, creates a markdown report, converts it to HTML, and sends it via email, streamlining the reporting process.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate weekly timesheet reporting. Instead of manually compiling hours worked by employees, the workflow automatically generates a report and emails it, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger to start the process.
3. Use the "GetTimesheetRecords" function to input your own timesheet data.
4. Configure the email node with your SMTP settings.
5. Test the workflow by executing it to see the report generation and email sending.

### Practice
Create a simple version of the workflow that only generates the report without sending an email. Change the timesheet records to reflect your own data and execute the workflow to see the markdown report output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you save time and resources by automating repetitive tasks. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, allowing you to build a profitable AI automation business that enhances operational efficiency.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "GetTimesheetRecords" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
