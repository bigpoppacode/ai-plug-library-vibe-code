# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, yourls.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Yourls (yourls)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Yourls1 (yourls)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of shortening a URL using Yourls and then retrieving the statistics for that shortened URL. It starts with a manual trigger, shortens a specified URL, and finally fetches the stats for that shortened link.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to easily shorten URLs for marketing campaigns. For instance, if they want to share a link to a product on social media, they can execute this workflow to get a concise link, track clicks, and analyze engagement.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Yourls** node to shorten a URL (set the original URL and title).
4. Connect a second **Yourls** node to fetch stats for the shortened URL using the output from the first node.
5. Execute the workflow to test and see the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the original URL and title in the Yourls node to see how different inputs affect the output. Also, check the stats returned to understand how to interpret them.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide value by helping businesses track their marketing efforts more effectively. This skill can attract clients looking for automated solutions to their URL management, enhancing your service offerings and generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Yourls1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
