# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving mattermost, dateTime, cron.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Mattermost** node.
2. **Step 1: Mattermost (mattermost)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Date & Time (dateTime)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Get the date today (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Read data on Google Sheets (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending daily Instagram statistics to a Mattermost channel. It retrieves today's date, pulls relevant data from Google Sheets, and formats a message to share follower counts and posts made.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate daily updates for their team, saving time on manual reporting. For example, a social media manager can set it up to send daily performance metrics, keeping the team informed without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron** node to schedule daily execution.
3. Use a **Function** node to get today's date.
4. Add a **Google Sheets** node to read relevant Instagram data.
5. Configure a **Mattermost** node to send the formatted message.
6. Connect the nodes and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the message format or adding another data source (like Facebook stats). Observe how the output changes and ensure it sends the correct information to Mattermost.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline communication and reporting, enhancing team efficiency. Providing automated updates can attract more clients seeking to improve their operational effectiveness, potentially increasing your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Mattermost" and "Read data on Google Sheets" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
