### Explain
This n8n workflow triggers when a new account is added in ActiveCampaign by an admin. It automates notifications, allowing users to receive updates about new accounts without manual checking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to get instant alerts when new customer accounts are created, ensuring timely follow-ups and improved customer onboarding experiences.

### Imitate

2. Add an "ActiveCampaign Trigger" node to listen for new accounts.
3. Set the trigger to activate on "account_add" events from admin sources.
4. Connect it to an action (e.g., send an email or Slack message).
5. Save and activate your workflow.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the workflow to send a notification to a different platform (like Slack) when a new account is added. Test it by adding an account in ActiveCampaign.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you streamline client communications, enhance customer service, and add value to your automation offerings, potentially increasing your income as a consultant or agency.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
