# Wait Code Export Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving code, scheduleTrigger, n8n.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Calculate Wait Time (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Run Daily at 2 AM (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get All Workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Loop Workflows (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get Existing Worfklow from Bitbucket (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: New or Changed? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Upload Workflow to Bitbucket (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Wait to Avoid Rate Limiting (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Set Bitbucket Workspace & Repository (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup of your workflows to Bitbucket. It runs daily at 2 AM, retrieves all workflows, checks for changes, and uploads them to a Bitbucket repository, ensuring your work is securely stored and versioned.

### Demonstrate
A tech startup can use this workflow to automatically back up their development workflows each night. This prevents data loss and allows team members to revert to previous versions if needed, ensuring smooth project continuity.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily at 2 AM.
3. Add a **Get All Workflows** node to fetch your workflows.
4. Use a **Split In Batches** node to process each workflow.
5. Add an **HTTP Request** node to check for existing workflows in Bitbucket.
6. Use an **IF** node to determine if the workflow is new or changed.
7. If changed, upload it using another **HTTP Request** node.
8. Include a **Wait** node to avoid rate limiting, and finish with a **Set** node to define your Bitbucket workspace and repository.

### Practice
Try modifying the schedule trigger to run at a different time and see how it affects the workflow execution. Additionally, change the Bitbucket repository settings and observe how it impacts the backup process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to ensure data safety for your automations, enhancing reliability for clients. It positions you as a professional who can offer automated backup solutions, adding value to your services and potentially increasing your income as a consultant or developer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Calculate Wait Time" and "Set Bitbucket Workspace & Repository" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
