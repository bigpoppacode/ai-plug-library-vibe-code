### Explain
This n8n workflow extracts expense data from emails and logs it into a Google Sheet. It checks email subjects for keywords, reads attachments for receipt data, and organizes the information into a structured format for easy tracking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically track expenses from receipts sent via email, reducing manual data entry and ensuring accurate financial records for budgeting and reporting.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up your email credentials and Google Sheets access.
3. Adjust the subject patterns in the "Setup Variables" step to match your expense receipt formats.
4. Execute the workflow to start capturing data automatically.

### Practice
Try sending a test email with an expense receipt to your configured inbox. Execute the workflow and check if the data appears correctly in your Google Sheet. Modify the subject patterns if necessary to capture different formats.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
