## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving recent Reddit posts about n8n, filtering them based on certain criteria, and summarizing the relevant content with OpenAI. It ensures only the most pertinent posts are processed and categorized.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor discussions about their product on Reddit. By automating the retrieval and analysis of feedback, they can quickly identify customer sentiments and trends, allowing for timely responses or product improvements.

### Imitate
1. Start with a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add a **Reddit Search** node to fetch posts.
3. Use the **Set** node to define parameters (upvotes, date).
4. Incorporate **IF** nodes to filter out irrelevant posts.
5. Use **OpenAI** nodes to summarize and classify posts.
6. Test and adjust conditions based on your specific needs.

### Practice
Try modifying the Reddit workflow to pull posts from a different subreddit or change the criteria (e.g., number of upvotes) to see how it affects the results. This will help you understand the impact of various filters.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to leverage automation for real-time market insights, enhancing your ability to respond to customer needs, thus attracting more clients and generating income through consulting services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
