### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves emails from Gmail, processes a JSON file, and saves its content to a CSV spreadsheet. It ensures data organization and can automate repetitive tasks related to email management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically log customer inquiries or feedback received via email into a spreadsheet. This saves time on manual data entry and keeps records organized for review.

4. Connect a "move binary data" node to ensure data is processed correctly.
5. Customize the spreadsheet file name and format.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow: set up the Gmail node to fetch emails, then log the subject lines of those emails into a Google Sheet. Test it out by sending yourself a few emails.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
