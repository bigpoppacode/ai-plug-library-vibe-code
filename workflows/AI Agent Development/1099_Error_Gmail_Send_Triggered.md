## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Error Trigger** node.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically sends an email when an error occurs in another part of your automation. It uses an Error Trigger to detect failures and then sends a detailed email via Gmail to a specified recipient, including error details and execution information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor automated tasks. For example, if an automated sales report fails to generate, the owner would instantly receive an email alert detailing the error, allowing for quick resolution and minimal downtime.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add an **Error Trigger** node to start the workflow on errors.
3. Add a **Gmail** node to send an email.
4. In the Gmail node, set the recipient, subject, and email body to include error details using expressions.
5. Save and activate the workflow.

### Practice
Set up a simple automation that intentionally fails (like a broken API call) to trigger the error. Ensure your error email is sent correctly, then adjust the message to include specific error details for clarity.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you ensure reliability in your automations. By promptly addressing errors, you can enhance service quality, retain customers, and position yourself as a dependable solution provider, ultimately driving more revenue for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Error Trigger" and "Gmail" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
