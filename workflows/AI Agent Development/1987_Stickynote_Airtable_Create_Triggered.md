### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.

3. Add a Google Drive node to share the file with a recipient.
4. Use an Airtable node to log the file's metadata.
5. Add sticky notes to document each step for clarity.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that triggers when a new file is added to a different cloud storage service (e.g., Dropbox) and logs information in a Google Sheet instead of Airtable. Test it by uploading a new file and checking if it logs correctly.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
