10. **Step 9: Get Image URL of Midjourney (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Get Image URL of GPT-4o-image (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Check Generation Status of GPT-4o (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Check Video Generation Status (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Wait for Video Generation (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of 3D presentations by generating images and videos using AI tools. It starts when a user triggers it, sends prompts to image generation services, checks their status, and fetches the final video URL for presentation.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create engaging marketing content. For instance, an e-commerce store owner can automatically generate 3D product videos for their online catalog, enhancing customer engagement and boosting sales.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Configure an **HTTP Request** node to send a prompt to an image generation API.
4. Add nodes to check the image generation status and retrieve the final video URL.
5. Test the workflow by clicking **Execute**.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the HTTP Request node to generate different images. Experiment with various styles or subjects to see how the workflow adapts and what outputs you receive.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content creation, saving time and enhancing creativity. By offering such services, you can attract clients looking for efficient marketing solutions, potentially increasing your income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
