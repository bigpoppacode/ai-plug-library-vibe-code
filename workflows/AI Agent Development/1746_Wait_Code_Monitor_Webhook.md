## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks the status of backlinks from Google Sheets, cleans the URLs, and sends requests to DataForSEO to verify if they are live or lost, updating the results back in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A digital marketing agency could use this workflow to regularly audit client backlinks, ensuring they maintain strong SEO standings by identifying and addressing lost links, thus improving client retention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets account.
3. Adjust the Google Sheets node to match your data range.
4. Set up DataForSEO credentials.
5. Run the workflow and monitor results in Google Sheets.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to check backlinks from a different source, like a CSV file, instead of Google Sheets, to understand how data input affects the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you provide valuable SEO services to clients, potentially leading to increased business opportunities and income through automation and data management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Loop Over Items" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
