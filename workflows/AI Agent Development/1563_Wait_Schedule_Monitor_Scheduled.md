## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of tracking daily energy costs from PG&E. It logs into the PG&E website, retrieves the energy costs for electricity and gas, and sends a daily summary email to specified recipients.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically monitor energy expenses, ensuring they stay informed about daily costs. This helps in budgeting and identifying any unusual spikes in energy consumption.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your PG&E credentials in the Variables node.
3. Adjust the Schedule Trigger to your preferred time.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves energy costs and sends the email correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log energy costs into a Google Sheet instead of sending an email. This will help you understand how to adapt workflows for different outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients, helping them save time and reduce costs. This skill can lead to increased revenue through consulting or automation service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
