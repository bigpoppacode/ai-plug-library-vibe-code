## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading RSS feeds, filtering recent news, and saving the relevant information in Google Sheets. It uses triggers, data manipulation, and scheduling to streamline news management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically collect and archive news articles related to their industry from various RSS feeds. This saves time and keeps them informed about market trends without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** for daily execution.
2. Use **RSS Feed Read** to pull articles from your chosen feeds.
3. Implement **Code** nodes to filter articles from the last 3 days.
4. Save filtered articles to **Google Sheets** using the **Save News** node.
5. Test and adjust settings as needed.

### Practice
Try creating your own workflow by connecting an RSS feed to a Google Sheet. Experiment with different feeds and filters, and analyze how the data is saved. Adjust the time interval to see how it affects the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content collection, enhance your market knowledge, and potentially offer this as a service to clients, generating income while saving them time and effort.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Read Links" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
