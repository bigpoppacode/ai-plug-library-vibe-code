## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow scrapes multiple web pages, extracts content using AI, and saves it in Google Drive. It automates data collection from websites, making it easy to gather and organize information without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A marketing consultant might use this workflow to gather competitor website content for analysis. This saves time and provides insights into their competitors' offerings, helping them refine their strategy.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the process.
3. Use an HTTP Request node to fetch website URLs from a sitemap.
4. Implement a SplitInBatches node to process URLs in manageable chunks.
5. Use a Jina.ai Web Scraper node to extract content.
6. Save the extracted content in Google Drive using the Google Drive node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to scrape a different website. Change the sitemap URL in the Set Website URL node and run the workflow to see if it successfully gathers content from the new site.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate data collection for clients, enhancing your service offerings. This skill can attract more customers, generate income, and position you as an expert in AI-driven automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
