### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of adding an email subscriber to a Mailchimp list. When triggered manually, it gathers the subscriber's email and name, then adds them to a specified Mailchimp list, making it easy to manage email marketing.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Mailchimp** node to connect to your Mailchimp account.
4. Configure the Mailchimp node with your list ID, email, and any merge fields (like the subscriber's name).
5. Test by executing the workflow manually to ensure it adds a subscriber correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to add multiple subscribers at once. Create a list of email addresses and names, then adjust the Mailchimp node to loop through this list, adding each subscriber. Test the workflow to see if it successfully adds all subscribers.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
