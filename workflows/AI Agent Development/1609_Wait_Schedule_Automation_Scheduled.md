# Wait Schedule Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving splitInBatches, scheduleTrigger, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Loop Over Channels (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Loop Over Messages (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Every day at 9pm (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Cool down Discord API rate limits (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Get all Discord channels (discord)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Cool down Message deletion API rate limits (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Cool down Get messages API rate limits (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Get messages from Channel (discord)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Delete Message (discord)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Filter Messages older than 7 days (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the cleaning of Discord channels by deleting messages older than 7 days. It runs daily at 9 PM, retrieves all channels, fetches messages, filters out the old ones, and deletes them while respecting API rate limits.

### Demonstrate
A business owner managing a Discord server can use this workflow to keep the channel tidy and compliant with data retention policies, enhancing user experience and reducing clutter without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure your Discord credentials.
3. Adjust the server ID in Discord nodes.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves channels and messages.
5. Activate the workflow for daily execution.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that archives messages older than 30 days instead of deleting them. This will help you understand how to modify the filter conditions and implement different actions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, allowing them to save time and maintain clean communication channels, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and retention.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Loop Over Channels" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
