15. **Step 14: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow generates graphic wallpapers by leveraging APIs from Midjourney and GPT-4o-mini, combining AI-generated images and text into a final design using the Canvas API. It automates the entire process from prompting to image creation and design.

### Demonstrate
A business owner in the design industry could use this workflow to quickly create unique wallpapers for clients, saving time on manual design work while offering personalized, AI-generated graphics that stand out in the market.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance.
2. Import this workflow JSON.
3. Fill in the Basic Params node with your API keys and desired prompts.
4. Test the workflow to generate your first graphic.
5. Modify prompt details to create different designs.

### Practice
Experiment by changing the image prompt in the Basic Params node to see how different prompts affect the generated images. Test various styles and themes to understand the impact on the final output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate graphic design processes, enabling you to offer unique, AI-generated content to clients. This can differentiate your services, boost customer engagement, and create additional revenue streams as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
