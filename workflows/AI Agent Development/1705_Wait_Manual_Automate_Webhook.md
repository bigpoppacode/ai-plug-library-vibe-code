## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating video captions using the json2video API. It triggers manually, configures video settings, sends a request to add captions, waits for the process to complete, checks for errors, and outputs the final video link.

### Demonstrate
A business owner creating video content could use this workflow to automatically add captions to their promotional videos, saving time and ensuring accessibility for viewers, which enhances engagement and reach.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the workflow.
3. Use a Set node to define video URL, width, and height.
4. Add an HTTP Request node to call the json2video API for adding captions.
5. Implement a Wait node to pause the workflow while processing.
6. Use an If node to check for errors and handle them with a NoOp node.
7. Create an Output node to display the final video link.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow by using a different video URL and caption style. Test it to see how it handles errors, then try modifying parameters like resolution and quality to understand their impact.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer video captioning services, enhancing your portfolio and providing an additional revenue stream as businesses increasingly seek accessible content for their audiences.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
