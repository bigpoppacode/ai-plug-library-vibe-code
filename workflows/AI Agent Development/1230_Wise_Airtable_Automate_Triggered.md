## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring Wise transfer state changes. It triggers on a specific event, retrieves transfer details, formats relevant data, and appends it to an Airtable database for record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically log every currency transfer's status changes from Wise into Airtable, ensuring accurate financial records without manual entry, thereby saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import this workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up a Wise account and connect it using API credentials.
3. Configure the Airtable node with your table details.
4. Test the workflow by triggering a Wise transfer and check Airtable for updates.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional data fields, such as the recipient's name or transfer fees, and see how the changes affect the Airtable records. This will help you understand data manipulation in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate financial processes for clients, making you more valuable as a consultant. It allows you to offer services that save time and enhance accuracy, leading to potential income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Wise Trigger" and "Airtable" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
