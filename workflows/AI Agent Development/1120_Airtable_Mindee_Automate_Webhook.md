### EDIP Breakdown of the n8n Workflow

**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of receiving a webhook request, analyzing a receipt using Mindee, and storing the data in Airtable. It then creates a message summarizing the expense details.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner receives receipts from expenses. Using this workflow, they can automatically extract data from receipts, store it in Airtable for tracking, and generate a summary message for reporting or budgeting.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive POST requests.
2. Connect to Mindee to analyze receipt data.
3. Use Airtable to create a new record with the extracted data.
4. Use a Set node to create a summary message from the data collected.

**Practice:**  
Try creating a simple version of this workflow by setting up a webhook that receives a test JSON payload with receipt data. Use the Set node to format a message and log it in the console.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to streamline expense management for businesses, offering a valuable service that saves time and reduces errors, potentially leading to new clients and income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
