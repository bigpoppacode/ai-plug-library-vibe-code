# Wait Redis Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, noOp, informationExtractor.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: No Operation, do nothing1 (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Information Extractor (informationExtractor)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: get wait seconds (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set last_seen (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Get waiting_reply (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Mod input (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: waiting_reply? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Set waiting_reply (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Get buffer (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Delete buffer_in (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Delete waiting_reply (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: WaitSeconds (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Buffer messages (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Set buffer_count increment (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Get last_seen (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Get buffer_count (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Map ouput (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
22. **Step 21: Check Inactivity + Count (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
23. **Step 22: Delete waiting_reply1 (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
24. **Step 23: No Operation, do nothing2 (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
25. **Step 24: Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
26. **Step 25: When Executed by Another Workflow (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
27. **Step 26: Mock input data (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
28. **Step 27: No Operation, do nothing3 (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
29. **Step 28: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
30. **Step 29: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
31. **Step 30: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of responding to chat messages. It extracts information, checks for replies, and interacts with an AI model (OpenAI) to generate responses, all while managing state through Redis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support via chat. Instead of manually responding to inquiries, the system can handle multiple messages, extract relevant information, and provide AI-generated replies, saving time and improving service.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install n8n and create a new workflow.
2. **Add a Trigger**: Use the Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. **Add Redis Nodes**: Set up nodes for storing and retrieving message states.
4. **Integrate OpenAI**: Connect to OpenAI for generating responses.
5. **Test the Workflow**: Run the workflow to see it in action and adjust based on feedback.

### Practice
Try creating a simple version of this workflow. Use a Manual Trigger to simulate a chat message, extract a keyword from it, and generate a fixed response using a Set node. Test it to ensure it works as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated chat solutions to businesses, enhancing their customer service capabilities. This can lead to new client opportunities, increased income, and a competitive edge in the automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
