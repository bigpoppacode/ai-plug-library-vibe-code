### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting new contacts from HubSpot every day at 7 AM and adds them to a Mailchimp list as members. This saves time and ensures consistent communication with new leads.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically add new leads from HubSpot to Mailchimp, ensuring timely follow-ups and marketing outreach without manual data entry, thus improving lead engagement and conversion rates.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron Trigger** node set to trigger daily at 07:00.
3. Add a **HubSpot Node** to fetch new contacts created in the last 24 hours.
4. Connect a **Mailchimp Node** to add those contacts as new members to your mailing list.
5. Save and activate the workflow.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that retrieves new contacts from a different source (like a Google Sheet) and adds them to another platform (like a different email service). This will help you understand adapting existing workflows to your needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you streamline client onboarding processes, enhance customer engagement, and offer automation services, leading to higher client satisfaction and increased income opportunities as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
