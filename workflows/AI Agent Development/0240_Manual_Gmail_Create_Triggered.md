### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email management by retrieving messages with a specific label, removing that label, and adding a new one. It's a way to organize your Gmail inbox without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically process customer inquiries labeled "Pending Response." Once addressed, the label is removed and a "Responded" label is added, streamlining email management.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** as the starting point.
3. Use the **Gmail** node to fetch emails with a specific label.
4. Use the **Gmail1** node to remove that label from the messages.
5. Use the **Gmail2** node to add a new label to those messages.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to add a different label instead of removing one. For example, fetch messages labeled "Follow Up," remove that label, and add "Processed." Test it with your own Gmail account.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you hours of manual email management, allowing you to focus on more critical tasks. It opens opportunities for automation services, enhancing your value proposition to clients and increasing your income potential.

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Gmail2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
