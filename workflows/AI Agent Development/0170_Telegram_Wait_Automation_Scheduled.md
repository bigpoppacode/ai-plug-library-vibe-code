## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking a website for updates every five minutes. It sends a notification via Telegram if any changes are detected, helping users stay informed without manual checking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor competitor websites for changes. If a competitor updates their pricing or launches a new product, the owner receives instant updates, allowing for timely strategic adjustments.

### Imitate
1. Set up an HTTP Request node to fetch data from a target website.
2. Add a Wait node to pause for 5 minutes before the next request.
3. Use another HTTP Request node to fetch data again.
4. Insert an IF node to compare the two responses.
5. Configure a Telegram node to send a message if changes are detected.
6. Add a Cron node to trigger the workflow every 5 minutes.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow by monitoring a personal blog for new posts. Set the HTTP Request to check the blog's homepage, and configure the Telegram node to send a notification to yourself if a new post appears.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable monitoring services to businesses, creating opportunities for recurring revenue. Keeping clients updated on competitor actions can enhance their market positioning and decision-making.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTTP Request" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
