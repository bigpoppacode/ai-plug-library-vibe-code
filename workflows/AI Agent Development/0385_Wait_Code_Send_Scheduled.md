## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the collection of event data from a specified webpage, processes it, and sends a monthly email summary to a designated recipient. It uses HTTP requests to fetch event details, extracts relevant information, and formats it for email delivery.

### Demonstrate
A business owner hosting events might use this workflow to automatically gather and send a monthly newsletter with upcoming events to subscribers, saving time and ensuring timely communication.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch the events page.
3. Use HTML Extract nodes to gather event data.
4. Set conditions to check if there are more pages to process.
5. Format the extracted data and set up an email node to send the summary monthly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to collect events from a different website. Change the HTTP request URL and adjust the HTML extraction selectors to see how it affects the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable automation services, helping clients save time and improve communication. This skill can lead to new business opportunities, enhance customer engagement, and generate income through automation consultancy.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get events page" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
