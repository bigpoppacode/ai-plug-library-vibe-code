## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching relevant Reddit posts about "n8n," filtering for quality content, classifying it with OpenAI, and summarizing it for further analysis. It helps streamline the collection of pertinent information from social platforms.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to monitor Reddit for discussions about their product, ensuring they stay informed about customer opinions, trends, and potential issues, thus enabling quick responses and improved engagement strategies.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use the **Reddit** node to search for posts with keywords.
4. Implement conditions with **IF** nodes to filter posts based on upvotes and recency.
5. Utilize **OpenAI** nodes to classify and summarize the posts.
6. Store the results in a database or send notifications.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include another social media platform like Twitter. Set it up to fetch tweets containing specific hashtags related to your business and apply the same filtering and summarization process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable insights to clients, enhance their brand monitoring, and create tailored responses to customer feedback. This capability could lead to new business opportunities and increased revenue as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
