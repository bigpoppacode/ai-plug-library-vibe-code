2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: ActiveCampaign (activeCampaign)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates tasks by triggering an action when the 'execute' button is clicked, followed by updating a contact in ActiveCampaign with specified email and name details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly update customer information in ActiveCampaign after collecting it from a web form, ensuring their marketing lists are always up-to-date and accurate.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Add an "ActiveCampaign" node to update customer details.
4. Configure the ActiveCampaign node with email and name parameters.
5. Execute the workflow to test the update.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
