# Manual Openai Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, googleSheets.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get Google Sheets records (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Aggregate responses into arrays (aggregate)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Summarize via GPT model (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Convet from Markdown to HTML (markdown)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering feedback from a Google Sheets form, summarizing it using OpenAI's GPT model, and sending the summary via email. It collects responses, aggregates them, generates a summary, converts it to HTML, and emails it to the specified recipient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly analyze event feedback. Instead of manually reviewing each response, they can automate the summarization process, saving time and providing actionable insights for future events.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Google Sheet to collect feedback.
3. Adjust the Google Sheets node with your document ID and sheet name.
4. Modify the OpenAI prompt to suit your feedback questions.
5. Configure the Gmail node to send the email to your desired recipient.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow that only collects responses from a Google Sheet and sends a summary email without using the OpenAI node. This will help you understand the basic flow before adding complexity.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline feedback analysis for clients, enhancing their decision-making processes. This skill can attract more customers and generate income by offering automation services that save time and improve efficiency.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Send via Gmail" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
