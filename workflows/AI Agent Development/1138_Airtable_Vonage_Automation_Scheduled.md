## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates daily language learning by fetching the top three articles from Hacker News, extracting unique words from their titles, translating them to German, and sending a daily SMS with the words to the user.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to create a daily language learning tool for clients. By automating the process of fetching, translating, and sending new vocabulary, they save users time and encourage consistent learning.

### Imitate
1. Set up a daily trigger in n8n.
2. Use the Hacker News node to fetch the top articles.
3. Add a function node to extract words from article titles.
4. Use the LingvaNex node to translate the words.
5. Filter and save the results in Airtable.
6. Craft a message with the words.
7. Send the message via SMS using Vonage.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to translate the words into a different language or change the source to another news site. Test it with your own phone number to see how the SMS notification works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable services in language learning automation, attract customers looking for personalized learning solutions, and potentially generate income through subscription models or consulting services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Daily trigger" and "Send SMS" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
