# Wait Schedule Create Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving scheduleTrigger, itemLists, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Split out detections (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get recent detections from Crowdstrike (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Get detection details (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Split out behaviours (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Look up SHA in Virustotal (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Look up IOC in Virustotal (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Split In Batches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Merge behaviour descriptions (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Set behaviour descriptions (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Create Jira issue (jira)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Post notification on Slack (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Pause 1 second (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing cybersecurity detections from CrowdStrike. It fetches recent detections, enriches them with data from VirusTotal, creates Jira tickets for tracking, and sends alerts via Slack, all in a streamlined manner.

### Demonstrate
A cybersecurity consultant could use this workflow to automatically handle alerts for new threats detected by CrowdStrike. By automating the detection analysis, they save time and ensure swift responses, improving overall security posture for clients.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily.
3. Use **HTTP Request** nodes to fetch detections from CrowdStrike.
4. Split detections using **Item Lists**.
5. Enrich data with VirusTotal using additional **HTTP Request** nodes.
6. Create Jira tickets and send alerts via Slack.
7. Test the workflow.

### Practice
Set up a simplified version of this workflow by fetching data from a public API (like a weather API), processing it, and sending a notification to yourself via email or Slack. Experiment with different endpoints and data transformations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable asset in cybersecurity automation. Understanding and implementing such processes can help you attract clients, streamline their operations, and ultimately generate income through effective automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
