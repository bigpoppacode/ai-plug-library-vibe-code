# Stopanderror Wait Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving executeWorkflowTrigger, switch, manualTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

32. **Step 31: Wait1 (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
33. **Step 32: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
34. **Step 33: Wait2 (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
35. **Step 34: Wait3 (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When Executed by Another Workflow" and "Sticky Note11" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
