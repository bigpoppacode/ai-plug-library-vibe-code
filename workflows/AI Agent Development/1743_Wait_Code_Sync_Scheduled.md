## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of syncing product data from a Shopify store to a Google Sheets document. It retrieves product details like title, tags, description, and price, ensuring that the data is organized and easily accessible for analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner wants to keep track of their Shopify products without manually updating a spreadsheet. This workflow automatically pulls product info daily, saving time and ensuring accuracy in inventory management.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily.
3. Use the **Shopify** node to fetch product data via GraphQL.
4. Process the data with a **Code** node to format it.
5. Write the formatted data to **Google Sheets** using the appropriate node.
6. Test and adjust your nodes as necessary.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to sync only specific product categories from Shopify. This will help you understand filtering data and customizing workflows to meet specific business needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to clients, enhancing their operational efficiency. This skill can help you attract more customers and generate income by providing tailored automation solutions that save time and reduce errors.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Wait1" and "Sticky Note8" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
