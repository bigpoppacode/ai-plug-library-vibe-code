## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Merge** node.
2. **Step 1: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Respond to Webhook (respondToWebhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Wait 3 sec (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Is Ready? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: FLUX Fill (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Check FLUX status (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Get Fill Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Show the image to user (respondToWebhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Mockups (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Editor page (html)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: NO OP (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of filling images using AI. It starts by receiving a request via a webhook, processes the request to fill an image based on specified parameters, checks the status, retrieves the filled image, and responds with it, making it efficient for tasks like graphic design or content creation.

### Demonstrate
A graphic design agency could use this workflow to automate image modifications for clients. When a client submits an image and prompt via a form, the workflow fills the image using AI, retrieves the result, and sends it back to the client, saving time and enhancing service delivery.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook to receive requests.
2. Use the Merge node to combine input data (image, prompt).
3. Add a Wait node for processing time.
4. Use HTTP Request nodes to call the AI service for image filling and check status.
5. Retrieve the filled image and respond to the original webhook with the result.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow where you manually input an image URL and a prompt. Set up the workflow to fill the image and return the result. Test it with various prompts to see how the AI handles different requests.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, like graphic design agencies or marketing teams, enhancing your business's efficiency and potentially increasing your income through high-ticket automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Merge" and "NO OP" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
