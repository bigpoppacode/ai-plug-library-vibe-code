2. Add a **SEND_EMAIL** node to send an introductory email.
3. Insert a **REPLY_EMAIL** node to handle responses.
4. Use **GET_EMAIL** to retrieve and process incoming emails.
5. Implement a **SEND_AND_WAIT** node to manage follow-ups.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send a personalized message based on the email subject. Change the content of the **SEND_EMAIL** node to include the subject line in the greeting. Test it by sending an email to your workflow.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
