# Wait Code Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore, wait.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Customer Datastore (n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Done looping? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Merge loop items (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging multiple runs into one. It begins with a manual trigger, retrieves customer data, processes it in batches, and checks if looping is done. Finally, it merges results and completes the task, enhancing efficiency.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline customer data processing when handling bulk updates or changes. Instead of manually processing each entry, the workflow automates the retrieval and merging of customer data, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n and add a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add a **Customer Datastore** node to retrieve customer data.
3. Insert a **Wait** node to manage processing time.
4. Use an **If** node to check if all items are processed.
5. Add a **Code** node to merge results.
6. Add a **NoOp** node to handle logic.
7. Conclude with a **SplitInBatches** node to manage item processing.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new data source, such as integrating a Google Sheets document to pull customer data instead of the datastore. Test the workflow to ensure it processes the data correctly and merges the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive data processing tasks, saving time and resources for businesses. This skill can attract clients seeking efficient automation solutions, potentially generating income through consulting or service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Loop Over Items" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
