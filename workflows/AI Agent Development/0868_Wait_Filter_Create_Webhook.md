## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping Trustpilot reviews for a competitor. It collects the URL and timeframe from a user, requests data from Bright Data, checks for processing status, retrieves the reviews, filters for negative feedback, summarizes them, generates ad copy, and sends a report via email.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to analyze competitor reviews. By understanding the negative feedback, they can create targeted marketing strategies to address customer pain points, improving their own offerings and attracting more customers.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Customize the form fields to collect your competitor's Trustpilot URL.
3. Set up Bright Data API credentials in the HTTP Request nodes.
4. Modify the email node to send results to your address.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a sample URL.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that only scrapes data from a single URL and emails you the results. Focus on understanding each node's function and how data flows through the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable insights to businesses by analyzing competitor feedback. This skill not only enhances your service offering but can significantly increase your income potential as a consultant or agency specializing in AI-driven automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note9" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
