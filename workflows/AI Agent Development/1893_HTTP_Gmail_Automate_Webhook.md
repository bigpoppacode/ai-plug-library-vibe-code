## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering SEO data from Google Search Console weekly. It triggers every Monday at 7 AM, retrieves SEO metrics, generates a report, and sends it via email.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically receive weekly SEO performance reports. This saves time on manual data collection, allowing them to focus on improving their website's visibility.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron Trigger** for Mondays at 7 AM.
3. Use an **HTTP Request Node** to fetch data from Google Search Console.
4. Add a **Function Node** to format the SEO report.
5. Create an **Email Node** to send the report to your email.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send the report to a different email address or change the trigger to daily instead of weekly. Observe how the workflow behaves with these changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate routine tasks, freeing up time for strategic activities. This skill can attract more clients seeking to enhance their online presence, thus generating income for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Weekly Trigger (Monday 7AM)" and "Send Weekly Report by Email" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
