### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically forwards Netflix emails received in Gmail to multiple specified email addresses using Mailjet. It triggers when a Netflix email arrives, extracts the recipients, and sends the email content to each recipient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to ensure family and friends receive shared Netflix notifications, like new releases or billing alerts, without manually forwarding each email, saving time and enhancing communication.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Gmail Trigger to check for Netflix emails.
3. Use the Set node to define recipient email addresses.
4. Use the Split Out node to handle each recipient individually.
5. Configure the Mailjet node to send the email to each recipient.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it functions as intended.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding a filter to forward only emails with specific keywords (e.g., "bill" or "new release") in the subject line. This will help you understand how to refine triggers and conditions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide valuable automation solutions for clients, helping them save time and streamline communication. This skill can attract more customers and generate income as part of an AI automation business, enhancing your service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Gmail Trigger" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
