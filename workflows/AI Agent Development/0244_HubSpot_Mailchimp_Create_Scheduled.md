# Hubspot Mailchimp Create Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving functionItem, cron, hubspot.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get last execution timestamp** node.
2. **Step 1: Get last execution timestamp (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Every day at 07:00 (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set new last execution timestamp (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Create/Update contact (hubspot)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get changed members (mailchimp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates daily updates of contacts in HubSpot based on changes in a Mailchimp mailing list. It checks for updates at 7 AM daily, retrieves new or modified members, and synchronizes their data in HubSpot.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their marketing software (Mailchimp) and CRM (HubSpot) are always in sync. For example, if a customer updates their email or contact details in Mailchimp, this workflow ensures those changes are reflected in HubSpot automatically.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Cron Node** to trigger the workflow daily at 07:00.
3. Add a **Function Node** to get the last execution timestamp.
4. Integrate a **Mailchimp Node** to fetch changed members since the last execution.
5. Use a **HubSpot Node** to create or update contacts based on the Mailchimp data.
6. Add a final **Function Node** to set the new execution timestamp.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to run at a different time or add a notification step (like sending a Slack message) after updating HubSpot. This helps reinforce your understanding of scheduling and connecting nodes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can significantly enhance your service offerings as an automation consultant. By ensuring data consistency between platforms, you provide businesses with reliable operations, leading to increased customer satisfaction and retention, and ultimately generating recurring revenue for your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get last execution timestamp" and "Get changed members" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
