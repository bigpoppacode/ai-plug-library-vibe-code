## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing sales inquiries. It triggers when a new email with a "Sales" label arrives, summarizes the email content using OpenAI, creates a sales opportunity in Odoo, and provides reminders via sticky notes.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline sales inquiries. Instead of manually reading emails and creating opportunities, it automatically summarizes inquiries and logs them in Odoo, saving time and ensuring no leads are missed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Gmail Trigger to catch emails labeled "Sales."
3. Add an Odoo node to create opportunities using email data.
4. Use OpenAI to summarize email content.
5. Create sticky notes for reminders and instructions.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a different email label or change the summary prompts in OpenAI. Test it by sending yourself an email with the new label and checking if the workflow captures and processes it correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently handle sales inquiries, freeing up your time for more strategic tasks. It can help you attract clients by demonstrating your ability to automate processes that enhance sales performance and customer engagement.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Received Emails with Sales Label" and "Summarize Email Content" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
