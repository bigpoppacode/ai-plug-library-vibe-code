## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing company information from Glassdoor using Google Gemini and a web scraper. It triggers when manually started, fetches data, processes it, and sends a summary notification.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly gather and summarize employee reviews from Glassdoor for potential hires, helping them make informed decisions about company culture and employee satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger.
3. Configure the Google Gemini model for text analysis.
4. Connect to the Bright Data web scraper API to fetch Glassdoor data.
5. Use the summarization node to condense the information.
6. Set up a notification (e.g., via email or Slack) to receive the summary.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow to summarize another company's employee reviews. Change the Glassdoor URL in the HTTP request node and test the workflow to see the new summary.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data gathering and analysis for clients, saving them time and improving decision-making. This skill can attract customers looking for efficient solutions, enhancing your value as an AI automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
