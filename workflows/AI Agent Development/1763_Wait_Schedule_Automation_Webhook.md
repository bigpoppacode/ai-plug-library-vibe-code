# Wait Schedule Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, wait.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get status (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Wait 60 sec. (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Completed? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Update result (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Set data (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Get new image (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Create 3D Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Get Url 3D image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Get File 3D image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Upload 3D Image (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting a 2D image into a 3D model. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves the image status from an API, waits for processing, and updates a Google Sheet with the result, storing the final 3D image in Google Drive.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline product design. For instance, an e-commerce store could automatically generate 3D models of products from 2D images, enhancing online shopping experiences and reducing manual workload.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Connect an HTTP Request node to get image status.
4. Insert a Wait node for processing time.
5. Use Google Sheets and Google Drive nodes to update and store results.
6. Test the workflow by uploading an image.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the image source in the workflow. Change the trigger to a scheduled time and test how it processes multiple images at once, observing the updates in Google Sheets and Drive.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you attract clients looking for 3D modeling solutions, enabling you to offer valuable automation services that save time and enhance product presentation, ultimately generating income for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Upload 3D Image" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
