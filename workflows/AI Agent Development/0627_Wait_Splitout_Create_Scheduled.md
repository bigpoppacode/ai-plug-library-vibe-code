3. **Step 2: Global Variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Fetch Reports from Qualys (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Remove Already Processed Reports (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Any Reports to Process? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Update Timestamp (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Get Last Timestamp (executeWorkflow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: XML (xml)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Create Case (theHiveProject)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Download Report (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Add Report As Attachment (theHiveProject)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
22. **Step 21: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
23. **Step 22: Sticky Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
24. **Step 23: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the retrieval of finished reports from the Qualys security platform, checks for new reports, processes them, and creates cases in TheHive for each report, ensuring organized tracking and management of security vulnerabilities.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically handle security reports after a vulnerability scan. Instead of manually checking for new reports, they can streamline the process, saving time and ensuring prompt action on security issues.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the Global Variables to set your Qualys API base URL.
3. Set up the HTTP Request node to fetch reports.
4. Use the filter node to remove already processed reports.
5. Implement the case creation in TheHive and attach reports automatically.

### Practice
Try running the workflow manually to see how it fetches reports from Qualys. Modify the query parameters to filter for reports based on different criteria (e.g., specific dates) to understand how changes affect outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated security management services, increasing your value as a consultant. You'll save clients time and improve their security posture, allowing you to command higher fees for your expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
