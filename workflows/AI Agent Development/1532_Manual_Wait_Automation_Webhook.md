# Manual Wait Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Generate Kling Video (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get Kling Video (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Verify Task Status (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get Final Video (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: GPT-4o Generator: Front View (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: GPT-4o Generator: Side View (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Get Image URL of Front Image (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Get Image URL of Side Image (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Verify Generation Status of Front View (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Verify Generation Status of Side View (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Wait for Video Generation (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Basic Params (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting images into dynamic videos by generating different views (front and side) and checking their status, ultimately producing a video output based on user-defined parameters.

### Demonstrate
A video game developer could use this workflow to create animated character models from static images, saving time on manual animations and enhancing game design efficiency, leading to faster project delivery.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install n8n and create a new workflow.
2. **Manual Trigger**: Add a Manual Trigger node to start the workflow.
3. **Generate Video**: Use the HTTP Request node to call an API for video generation, passing in image URLs and parameters.
4. **Check Status**: Implement If nodes to verify task completion.
5. **Retrieve Video**: Use code nodes to extract URLs of the generated video and images.
6. **Execute**: Test the workflow and adjust as necessary.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that generates a video from a single image using an online video generation API. Test it with various images and prompts to understand the process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables students to offer automated video production services, appealing to businesses needing quick content creation. This expertise can lead to increased client engagement and new revenue streams in a competitive market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Basic Params" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
