### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
