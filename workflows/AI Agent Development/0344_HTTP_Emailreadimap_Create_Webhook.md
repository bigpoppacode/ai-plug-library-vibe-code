## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically checks emails, extracts content, and creates a new card in Nextcloud Deck. It helps users streamline task management by converting email content into actionable cards without manual input.

### Demonstrate
A project manager receives task requests via email. Instead of manually creating cards in their project management tool, this workflow reads emails and generates cards in Nextcloud Deck, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up an IMAP Email node to read emails from your inbox.
2. Use a Function node to strip HTML and extract the email body.
3. Create an HTTP Request node to send the processed data to Nextcloud Deck as a new card.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to read emails from a specific sender and create cards only for those tasks. Test it with a few emails to ensure it works correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate email task management, freeing up time for more strategic work. As a consultant, you can offer this as a service to clients, enhancing their productivity and creating a steady income stream.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "IMAP Email" and "HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
