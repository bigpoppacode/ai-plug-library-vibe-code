## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks the availability of multiple domains using the Namesilo API, processing up to 200 domains at a time. It collects the domain availability data and outputs the results in an Excel file.

### Demonstrate
A web hosting company can use this workflow to quickly check the availability of multiple domain names for clients. This saves time and ensures they can suggest available options instantly, enhancing customer service.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your Namesilo API key and the domains you want to check in the "Set Data" node.
3. Execute the workflow and wait for the results.
4. Download the generated Excel file with availability data.

### Practice
Try modifying the domain list in the "Set Data" node to include different domains. Execute the workflow and check how the output changes based on the new inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate domain checks, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions for their domain registration processes, creating potential income opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Set Data" and "Start" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
