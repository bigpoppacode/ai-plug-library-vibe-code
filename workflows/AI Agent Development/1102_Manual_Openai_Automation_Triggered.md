# Manual Openai Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, openAi, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Split In Batches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Parse JSON (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Make JSON Table (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Convert to CSV (spreadsheetFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Save to Disk (writeBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Strip UTF BOM bytes (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Create valid binary (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of CSV files containing randomly generated user data using OpenAI. It starts with a manual trigger, generates user data in JSON format, processes it into tables, converts it to CSV, and saves the files to disk.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly generate mock user data for testing a new application or marketing campaign. Instead of manually creating data, they can automate the process, saving time and ensuring variety.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your OpenAI API credentials.
3. Modify the prompt in the OpenAI node to generate data relevant to your needs.
4. Adjust the CSV file naming convention if desired.
5. Execute the workflow to generate and save the CSV files.

### Practice
Try changing the OpenAI prompt to generate a different type of data (e.g., product information instead of user data). Execute the workflow and review the output to see how the changes affect the CSV file.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data generation tasks, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. This skill can be monetized by offering data generation services to clients, enhancing your value as an automation consultant or developer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
