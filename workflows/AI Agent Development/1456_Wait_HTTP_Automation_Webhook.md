## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating images based on prompts using an AI service. It sends a request to create an image, retrieves the resulting image URL, downloads the image, and saves it to Google Drive, all triggered manually.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to generate custom images for client presentations or social media posts. Instead of manually creating or sourcing images, they could automate the process, saving time and ensuring high-quality visuals.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new n8n workflow with a **Manual Trigger**.
2. Use the **Edit Fields** node to define image parameters (prompt, size).
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to call the image generation API.
4. Add another **HTTP Request** node to get the image URL.
5. Use a third HTTP Request node to download the image.
6. Integrate a **Google Drive** node to save the image.
7. Test the workflow and adjust parameters as needed.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that generates a single image and saves it to a local directory instead of Google Drive. Experiment with different prompts and image sizes to see how the results vary.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services, attract clients needing visual content generation, and differentiate your offerings by showcasing AI capabilities, potentially increasing your income through high-demand services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Fal Flux" and "Edit Fields" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
