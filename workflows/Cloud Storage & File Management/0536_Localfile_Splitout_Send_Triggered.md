## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring bank statements, extracting relevant tenant and property details, and reconciling rental payments using AI. It alerts users to discrepancies and updates a spreadsheet with findings.

### Demonstrate
A property management company could use this workflow to automatically check incoming bank statements against tenant payment records, reducing manual reconciliation efforts and quickly identifying payment issues.

### Imitate
1. Set up a file trigger to monitor a folder for new bank statement CSV files.
2. Use a code node to extract tenant details from a local spreadsheet.
3. Parse the CSV data to find discrepancies.
4. Use an AI agent to analyze the data and generate alerts.
5. Write the summary of findings back to the spreadsheet.

### Practice
Create a simplified version: Set up a file trigger for a sample CSV, extract data using a code node, and print out tenant details in the console. Experiment with modifying the input CSV to see how it affects outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to property management businesses, saving them time and reducing errors, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and potential income growth from your automation offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Watch For Bank Statements" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
