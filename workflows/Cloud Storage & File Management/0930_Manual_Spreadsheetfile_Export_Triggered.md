# Manual Spreadsheetfile Export Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, spreadsheetFile, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Spreadsheet File (spreadsheetFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: TableName (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Postgres (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of exporting data from a PostgreSQL database to a CSV file. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves data from a specified table, and then saves that data in CSV format.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to regularly export customer data or sales reports from their PostgreSQL database to analyze trends or share with stakeholders, saving time on manual data extraction.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Set** node to define the table name (e.g., "booksRead").
4. Add a **Postgres** node to execute a SQL query that retrieves data from the specified table.
5. Add a **Spreadsheet File** node to convert the retrieved data into a CSV file.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to export data from a different table in your PostgreSQL database. Change the table name in the Set node and test the workflow to see if it successfully creates a new CSV file with the updated data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data exports, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient data management solutions, enhancing your service offerings in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Postgres" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
