This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, emailSend, readBinaryFile.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Send Email (emailSend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Read Binary File (readBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Spreadsheet File (spreadsheetFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending personalized emails with attachments. It starts with a manual trigger, reads a CSV file containing user data, processes that data to split it into manageable batches, retrieves corresponding image files, and finally sends emails to users with their certificates attached.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate sending course completion certificates to students. Instead of manually emailing each student, the workflow pulls data from a CSV, attaches the relevant certificate image, and sends it out automatically, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n, starting with a Manual Trigger node.
2. Add a Read Binary File node to pull data from a CSV file.
3. Use a Spreadsheet File node to structure the CSV data.
4. Implement a Split In Batches node for processing in groups.
5. Add a Read Binary File node to fetch the certificate image.
6. Finally, connect a Send Email node to email each student with their certificate.

### Practice
Try creating a simple version of this workflow where you only send a plain text email to a single recipient. Use a Manual Trigger to start, and then an Email Send node to test sending your message. Gradually add complexity, such as reading from a file and attaching images.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving you and your clients time and money. It enhances your service offerings, enabling you to attract more customers and potentially charge higher fees for efficient automation solutions in your AI-driven business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Read Binary File1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
