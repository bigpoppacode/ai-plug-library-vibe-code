## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the recruitment process by extracting information from submitted CVs, evaluating candidates against a predefined profile using AI, and storing results in Google Sheets. It streamlines the hiring process, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to manage job applications efficiently. Instead of manually reviewing each CV, the workflow extracts qualifications, evaluates candidates, and logs results, allowing quick identification of suitable applicants without human error.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **formTrigger** to capture CV submissions.
2. Use **extractFromFile** to extract text from uploaded PDF CVs.
3. Implement **informationExtractor** to pull educational qualifications and skills.
4. Utilize **chainSummarization** to summarize candidate profiles.
5. Use **set** to define the job profile.
6. Add **googleSheets** to store candidate data.
7. Integrate **chainLlm** to evaluate candidates and provide feedback.
8. Test the workflow with sample CV submissions.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow. Use a Google Form for CV submissions, extract data using the **extractFromFile** node, and log the results in a Google Sheet. Experiment with different CV formats to see how well the extraction works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows students to provide valuable automation services to businesses, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy in recruitment processes. This skill can lead to new clients and increased income through high-demand automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On form submission" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
