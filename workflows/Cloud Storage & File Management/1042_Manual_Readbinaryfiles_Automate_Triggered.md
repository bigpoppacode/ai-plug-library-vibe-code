# Manual Readbinaryfiles Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, readBinaryFiles.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Read Binary Files (readBinaryFiles)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading binary files (like images) from a specified directory when triggered manually. Upon execution, it reads all `.jpg` files in the designated path, enabling further processing or actions based on those files.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automate image processing tasks, such as updating product images on a website. Instead of manually uploading each image, they can trigger this workflow to automatically read and process all new images in a specific folder, saving time and effort.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Read Binary Files** node, setting the file selector to your desired directory (e.g., `/data/lol/*.jpg`).
4. Connect the nodes and save your workflow.
5. Click "Execute" to test the workflow and read the binary files.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to read different file types (like `.png` or `.pdf`). Change the file selector in the **Read Binary Files** node and execute the workflow to see how it processes these files differently.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate file processing tasks, making your operations more efficient. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, helping you generate income as an automation consultant or freelancer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Read Binary Files" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
