## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping book data from a website, sorting it by price, converting it to a CSV file, and emailing that file. It starts when a new URL is added to a Google Sheet, triggering a series of actions to gather and process the book information.

### Demonstrate
A bookstore owner could use this workflow to regularly scrape prices and titles from a competitor's website. By automating this data collection, they can quickly adjust their pricing strategy based on real-time market data, saving time and gaining a competitive edge.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet to input URLs.
2. Create a new workflow in n8n.
3. Add a Google Sheets Trigger to watch for new URLs.
4. Use an HTTP Request node to scrape the webpage.
5. Extract book data using HTML nodes.
6. Sort the data by price.
7. Convert the data into a CSV file.
8. Email the CSV file using a Gmail node.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow to scrape data from a different website or category (e.g., electronics). Change the CSS selectors in the extraction steps and test the workflow to see if you can successfully gather new data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, saving them time and enhancing their competitive intelligence. This expertise can help you attract clients and generate income by providing ongoing data analysis and reporting solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Convert to CSV File" and "Split HTML Array into Individual Books" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
