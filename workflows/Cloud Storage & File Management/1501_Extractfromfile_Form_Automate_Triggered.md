## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reviewing resumes submitted via a web form. It extracts personal and professional information from resumes, evaluates candidates against a desired profile using AI, and logs the results in Google Sheets for easy tracking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline their hiring process. Instead of manually reviewing resumes, the workflow automatically collects submissions, analyzes qualifications, and provides a rating, saving time and reducing bias in hiring decisions.

### Imitate
1. **Set up a form** for resume submissions using a platform like Typeform.
2. **Create an n8n workflow** starting with the form submission trigger.
3. **Add nodes** for data extraction, AI evaluation, and Google Sheets integration.
4. **Map fields** to ensure data flows correctly between nodes.
5. **Test the workflow** by submitting a sample resume to see the automated process in action.

### Practice
Try adapting this workflow by adding a step that sends a confirmation email to candidates after their resume is submitted. This exercise will help reinforce the understanding of how workflows can improve communication in the hiring process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, helping them save time and improve their hiring processes. This skill can attract clients looking for efficiency, potentially leading to new income opportunities in the growing field of AI-driven automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On form submission" and "OpenAI Chat Model" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
