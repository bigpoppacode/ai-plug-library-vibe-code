### Explain
This n8n workflow reads data from a Google Sheets document, converts it into an HTML file, and exposes it via a webhook. It's useful for automating the process of generating web-friendly content from spreadsheet data.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to automatically create and serve reports or summaries as HTML files based on data gathered in Google Sheets, saving time and ensuring consistent formatting for client presentations.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with your data.
2. In n8n, create a new workflow.
3. Add a **Webhook** node as the trigger.
4. Connect a **Google Sheets** node to read data from your sheet.
5. Add a **Spreadsheet File** node to convert the data into an HTML file.
6. Test the webhook to ensure it generates the HTML file correctly.

### Practice
Create a sample Google Sheet with a few rows of data. Implement the workflow and test the webhook by triggering it and checking if the HTML file is generated and accessible.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, enabling them to streamline data reporting processes, enhance operational efficiency, and ultimately save time and resources, leading to increased revenue opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
