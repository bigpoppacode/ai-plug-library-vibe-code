## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the recruitment process. When a candidate submits a CV via a form, it extracts information from the CV, summarizes qualifications, evaluates the candidate against a specified profile using AI, and logs the results in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline hiring. Instead of manually reviewing CVs, the workflow automatically extracts key qualifications and evaluates candidates, saving time and ensuring consistent assessments.

### Imitate
1. Create a form for CV submissions using n8n.
2. Set up an Extract node to pull data from uploaded CVs.
3. Use AI to evaluate qualifications against your requirements.
4. Log results in Google Sheets for easy tracking.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a sample CV.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a rejection email for candidates who don't meet the qualifications. This will help you understand how to customize automated responses based on AI evaluations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save time in recruitment, improve the quality of hires, and allow you to offer automated hiring solutions as a service, adding value to your business and attracting clients.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On form submission" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
