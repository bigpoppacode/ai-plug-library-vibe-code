# Schedule Extractfromfile Import Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving documentDefaultDataLoader, textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, embeddingsOpenAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: Default Data Loader (documentDefaultDataLoader)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Recursive Character Text Splitter (textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Embeddings OpenAI (embeddingsOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Postgres PGVector Store (vectorStorePGVector)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Move File (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Download File (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Search Folder (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Switch (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Extract from PDF (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Extract from Text (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Extract from JSON (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of loading documents from Google Drive, processing them into embeddings, and storing them in a vector database. It efficiently categorizes files by type (PDF, text, JSON) and prepares them for retrieval and analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline document management. For example, a law firm could automatically load case files from Google Drive, categorize them, and store relevant data in a vector database for easy access by AI agents during legal research.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and connect your Google Drive account.
2. Create a new workflow with a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily.
3. Add a **Search Folder** node to find documents in a specific folder.
4. Use the **Download File** node to retrieve files.
5. Implement a **Switch** node to categorize files by type (PDF, text, JSON).
6. Process files with **Extract** nodes and store them in a **Postgres PGVector Store**.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to only process PDF files. Set up the **Switch** node to filter out non-PDF files and log the number of files processed. This will help you understand file categorization and processing flow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services, saving businesses time and improving their data management. This expertise can attract clients, increase your service offerings, and generate income by providing streamlined document handling solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Default Data Loader" and "Extract from JSON" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
