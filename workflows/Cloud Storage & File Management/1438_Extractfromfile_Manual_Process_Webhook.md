# Extractfromfile Manual Process Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, extractFromFile, googleDrive.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking 'Test workflow'** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking 'Test workflow' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Extract from File (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Google Drive (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Call Gemini 2.0 Flash with PDF Capabilities (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Call Claude 3.5 Sonnet with PDF Capabilities (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Define Prompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting information from a PDF file stored in Google Drive and utilizes AI models (Gemini 2.0 and Claude 3.5) to analyze the content for specific prompts. It simplifies data extraction and comparison between two AI models.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate invoice processing. Instead of manually extracting VAT numbers from PDF invoices, the workflow retrieves the PDF, processes it, and gets the required data from the AI, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Add Google Drive node to download a PDF file.
3. Use the "Extract from File" node to convert the PDF to base64.
4. Configure HTTP Request nodes for Gemini 2.0 and Claude 3.5 with your prompts.
5. Test the workflow to see the extracted data.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the "Define Prompt" node to extract different data from a PDF (e.g., customer names or dates) and run the workflow to see how the AI responds to your changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, streamline their document processing, and create scalable solutions that save time and reduce operational costs, ultimately leading to higher revenue opportunities for your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking 'Test workflow'" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
