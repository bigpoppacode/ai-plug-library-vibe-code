## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the job application process by extracting data from uploaded CVs, processing it with AI for relevance, and storing it in Airtable, ensuring a streamlined application review.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automate job applications, improving efficiency by quickly sorting and analyzing candidate qualifications, thus saving time and ensuring no application is overlooked.

### Imitate
1. Set up a form trigger in n8n for CV uploads.
2. Use an "Extract from File" node to pull data from uploaded PDFs.
3. Integrate AI nodes to classify and evaluate CVs.
4. Store results in Airtable to track applications.
5. Set up email notifications for new submissions.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow where you upload a text document instead of a CV. Use n8n to extract specific data points (like name and email) and save them to a Google Sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, improving their hiring processes and potentially generating income through consulting or by providing automated solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Extract from File" and "Submission Success" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
