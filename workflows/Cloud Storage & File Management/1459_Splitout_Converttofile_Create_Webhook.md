## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: Convert to File (convertToFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenAI - Generate Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set Variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating images using OpenAI based on a prompt. It starts with a manual trigger, sets variables for the image generation, sends a request to OpenAI, and processes the output, converting it into a usable file format.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to create custom graphics for social media campaigns. Instead of hiring a designer for every graphic, they can automate image generation based on trending topics, saving time and costs.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the process.
3. Use a **Set** node to define variables like prompt, image size, and quality.
4. Add an **HTTP Request** node to call the OpenAI API with the set parameters.
5. Use a **Convert to File** node to handle the image output.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it generates images correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the **Set** node to generate different styles of images, such as "a futuristic cityscape" or "a cozy winter cabin." Run the workflow to see how the images vary based on your input.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated image generation services, enhancing your value proposition. This skill can attract clients looking for quick and cost-effective graphics, potentially leading to new revenue streams in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Convert to File" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
