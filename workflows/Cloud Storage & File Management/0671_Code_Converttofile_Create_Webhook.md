## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing incoming emails from Gmail and Microsoft Outlook. It checks if the emails are potentially malicious or benign, creates tickets in Jira for further investigation, and saves relevant data, including screenshots and email content.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate email security checks. For instance, if they receive numerous customer inquiries via email, this setup helps quickly identify and address potential phishing attempts, enhancing security and response efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Gmail and Outlook triggers for incoming emails.
3. Configure nodes to extract email details and analyze using ChatGPT.
4. Set up Jira integration to create tickets based on the analysis.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample emails.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that only monitors Gmail. Set it to log incoming emails into a Google Sheet instead of creating Jira tickets. This will reinforce understanding of email extraction and data logging.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable security automation services, attracting clients needing email protection. This can lead to recurring revenue through ongoing monitoring and updates, enhancing your business offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Gmail Trigger" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
