### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of tasks in Onfleet based on data from a spreadsheet. It reads an Excel file, extracts relevant information, and formats it for task creation in Onfleet, streamlining delivery operations.

### Demonstrate
A delivery service could use this workflow to automate task creation. Instead of manually entering each delivery from a spreadsheet, the workflow reads the spreadsheet and creates corresponding tasks in Onfleet, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Update the file path in the Read Binary File node to your spreadsheet location.
3. Ensure Onfleet API credentials are configured.
4. Customize any field mappings in the Onfleet node as needed.
5. Execute the workflow to create tasks from your spreadsheet.

### Practice
Create a sample spreadsheet with delivery data (addresses, names, notes) and run the workflow. Check Onfleet to confirm that tasks have been created correctly, ensuring each entry from the spreadsheet is reflected as a task.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automation services to delivery businesses, enhancing their efficiency and accuracy. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and the potential for recurring revenue as you help businesses scale their operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Onfleet" and "Spreadsheet File1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
