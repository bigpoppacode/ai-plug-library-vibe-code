### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending personalized congratulatory messages on specific dates. It checks a Google Sheets calendar for events and, if any match the current date, sends SMS messages via Twilio.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically send birthday wishes to clients, enhancing customer relationships without manual effort, thus saving time and increasing engagement.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Daily Trigger to start the workflow.
2. Use Google Sheets to store event dates and messages.
3. Add a condition to check if today matches any event.
4. If true, merge data and personalize messages.
5. Use Twilio to send SMS with the personalized message.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with a few dates and messages. Run the workflow on a scheduled time to see if it sends messages correctly for events on that date. Adjust the messages or dates as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate client engagement, saving valuable time, enhancing customer relationships, and potentially increasing your income by offering similar automation services to other businesses.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
