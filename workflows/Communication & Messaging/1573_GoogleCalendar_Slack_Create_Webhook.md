## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating Google Meet links directly from Slack. When a specific command is triggered in Slack, it creates a temporary calendar event with a Google Meet link, sends the link back to the Slack channel, and then deletes the temporary event.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline virtual meetings. When a team member types `/meet` in Slack, everyone in the channel instantly receives a Google Meet link, saving time on scheduling and enhancing team collaboration.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Slack app and enable a slash command (e.g., `/meet`).
2. Create a webhook in n8n to listen for the command.
3. Add Google Calendar integration to create a temporary event with a Meet link.
4. Configure a Slack node to send the generated link back to the channel.
5. Add a step to delete the temporary calendar event after sending the link.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the meeting duration or add specific participants to the Google Meet link. Test it by triggering the command in Slack and observing the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services, saving clients time and improving communication. This can lead to higher client satisfaction, increased referrals, and potential income through consulting or service packages.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
