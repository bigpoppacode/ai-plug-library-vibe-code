# Twilio Cron Send Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, postgres, twilio.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Postgres (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Twilio (twilio)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Postgres1 (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors a PostgreSQL database for sensor readings above a certain threshold. If such readings are found, it sends an alert via Twilio and updates the database to mark the notification as sent.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with IoT devices can use this workflow to automatically alert staff when sensors indicate a critical issue, like a temperature spike in a server room, ensuring timely responses to prevent failures.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Cron node** to run the workflow at your desired intervals.
2. Configure a **Postgres node** to query your database for alerts.
3. Add a **Twilio node** to send SMS alerts based on the query results.
4. Use a **Set node** to prepare the notification status.
5. Add another **Postgres node** to update the notification status in your database.

### Practice
Try modifying the threshold in the Postgres query to test the workflow. Change it to a lower value, run the workflow, and check if the alerts trigger correctly, ensuring the Twilio messages are sent.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate monitoring and alerting systems, providing value to businesses by minimizing downtime and improving response times, ultimately leading to better customer satisfaction and potential revenue growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Postgres1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
