## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks the price of Bitcoin (BTC) in Euros (EUR) every minute. If the price exceeds €9000, it sends an SMS alert via Twilio. This automates price monitoring and notifications for users interested in cryptocurrency.

### Demonstrate
A business owner, like a cryptocurrency trader, might use this workflow to receive instant alerts when Bitcoin's price rises above €9000. This allows them to make quick trading decisions without constantly checking prices.

### Imitate
1. **Create a new workflow in n8n.**
2. **Add a Cron node** to trigger every minute.
3. **Use the CoinGecko node** to fetch Bitcoin's price in EUR.
4. **Implement an IF node** to check if the price is >= €9000.
5. **Add a Twilio node** to send an SMS if the condition is met.
6. **Test the workflow** to ensure it works.

### Practice
Set up the workflow and adjust the threshold price (e.g., €8000) to see how the SMS notifications work. Experiment with changing the frequency of checks (e.g., every 5 minutes) to understand the impact on responsiveness.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate price monitoring, providing value to potential clients in crypto trading or investment. It can generate income by offering these automation services, making you a sought-after consultant in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
