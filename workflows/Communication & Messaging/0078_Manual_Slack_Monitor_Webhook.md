### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating your Slack status and Philips Hue lights based on your Google Calendar events. It detects when an event starts and changes your Slack status and light colors accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to manage their presence during meetings. For example, they could set their Slack status to "Busy" and change their office lights to red when a meeting starts, signaling to colleagues that they are unavailable.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Google Calendar trigger for event start.
3. Use a Switch node to determine the event type.
4. Add HTTP Request nodes to change Philips Hue lights based on event status.
5. Add a Slack node to update your status.
6. Test the workflow by adding a calendar event.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the Slack status based on different colors or event types. For instance, set the status to "Available" and turn the lights green when an event ends.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
