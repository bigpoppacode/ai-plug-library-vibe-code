## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On Contact Identified** node.
2. **Step 1: If is not new contact (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: On Contact Identified (mauticTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: extract information (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: validate email (oneSimpleApi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks if a contact's email is valid and alerts the team if it's suspicious. It starts by identifying if the contact is new, extracts their information, validates the email, and sends a Slack notification for any suspicious emails.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to ensure they only engage with valid leads. For example, if someone fills out a contact form, the workflow checks the email's validity, allowing the owner to avoid sending marketing materials to invalid addresses.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a trigger for new contacts (e.g., using Mautic).
3. Add nodes to extract contact info and validate the email.
4. Configure conditions for suspicious emails.
5. Set up a Slack notification to alert your team.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send an email instead of a Slack notification when a suspicious email is detected. This will help you understand how to customize notifications based on your needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation skills, allowing you to offer valuable email validation services to clients. This can lead to better customer engagement and higher conversion rates, ultimately generating more income for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "If is not new contact" and "Send to Slack" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
