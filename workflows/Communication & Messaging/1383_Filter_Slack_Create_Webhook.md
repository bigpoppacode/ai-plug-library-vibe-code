13. **Step 12: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the classification of bug tickets by analyzing them with AI. It triggers when a new ticket is created, filters tickets needing classification, uses an AI model to determine which team should handle the ticket, and notifies the appropriate team via Slack.

### Demonstrate
A software company receives numerous bug reports daily. Instead of manually sorting them, this workflow automatically classifies each ticket, assigns it to the right team based on predefined criteria, and sends a notification, thus speeding up response times and improving team efficiency.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install n8n and set up your environment.
2. **Create Workflow**: Start a new workflow.
3. **Add Trigger**: Use a Linear Trigger to start when a new bug ticket is created.
4. **Filter Tickets**: Add a filter to only process tickets that require classification.
5. **Integrate AI**: Use OpenAI to classify the bug and determine the right team.
6. **Notify**: Add a Slack node to send notifications to the relevant team.
7. **Test**: Run the workflow with sample data to ensure it works correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow. Trigger it with manual input (like a form submission) instead of a ticketing system. Use static data for the ticket and test the AI classification and notification steps to see how they function without needing real tickets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to automate ticket management, saving time and resources for businesses. It enhances your service offerings as a consultant, allowing you to provide valuable automation solutions, increase customer satisfaction, and potentially generate higher income through efficiency-driven projects.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Linear Trigger" and "OpenAI" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
