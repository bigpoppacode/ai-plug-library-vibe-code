## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the classification of bug tickets by using AI to determine which team should handle each issue. It triggers when a ticket is created, filters tickets based on specific criteria, and then updates the respective team in a project management tool while notifying them via Slack.

**Demonstrate:** A software development team can use this workflow to automatically assign bug reports to the right teams based on the issue's details, thus speeding up response times and ensuring that the right expertise is applied to each problem.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Linear and OpenAI credentials.
3. Adjust the team names in the "Set me up" node to match your organization.
4. Customize the Slack channel in the "Set me up" node.
5. Test by creating a new ticket in Linear and see it get classified.

**Practice:** Create a test Linear ticket with a specific label and description. Trigger the workflow and check if the correct team is notified via Slack. Experiment with changing the ticket's details to see how it affects the classification.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to streamline team operations, improve response times, and enhance customer satisfaction. It positions you as a valuable asset for businesses looking to leverage AI and automation, opening doors for consulting opportunities and increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Linear Trigger" and "OpenAI" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
