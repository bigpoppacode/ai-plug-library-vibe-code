## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates notifications based on GitHub notifications received within the last minute. It checks for new notifications, processes them, and sends a message to a Discord channel if there are any updates.

### Demonstrate
A developer can use this workflow to stay updated on GitHub notifications without manually checking, saving time and ensuring they never miss important updates about their projects or repositories.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up GitHub API authentication.
3. Customize the Discord channel and message format.
4. Schedule the Cron node to run every minute.
5. Test the workflow by triggering GitHub notifications.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send notifications to an email instead of Discord. Adjust the necessary nodes and observe how the workflow behaves with different notification types.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate communication about project updates, enhancing your productivity and responsiveness. This skill can help attract clients looking to streamline their operations, creating value and potential income for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "@Get Issue" and "@Get Date 1 min ago" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
