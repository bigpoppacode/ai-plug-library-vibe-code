## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of event banners. It captures event details via a form, generates an AI image, uploads it to Cloudinary, uses Bannerbear to create a banner template, and shares the final banner on Discord.

### Demonstrate
A business owner hosting an event can use this workflow to streamline marketing. Instead of manually designing banners, they input event details, and the automation generates and shares a professional banner, saving time and enhancing promotion.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Form Trigger to capture event details (title, location, date).
3. Use the HTTP Request node to upload generated images to Cloudinary.
4. Use the Bannerbear node to create a banner with the uploaded image.
5. Send the final banner to Discord using the Discord node.

### Practice
Try modifying the form fields in the n8n workflow to capture additional details (like event description) and see how it affects the banner generation. Test it by submitting different inputs to observe the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services, helping clients save time and money. You can create professional marketing assets quickly, making you a sought-after resource in the growing field of AI automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "n8n Form Trigger" and "Generate AI Banner Image" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
