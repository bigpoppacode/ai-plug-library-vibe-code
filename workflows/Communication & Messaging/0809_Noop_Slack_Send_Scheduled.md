2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks a Notion database for tasks assigned to a specific person (Harshil) every day at 8 AM. If there are any incomplete tasks, it sends a direct message to Harshil on Slack, ensuring he stays updated on his responsibilities.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically notify team members about their pending tasks. For example, a project manager can ensure that team members are aware of their responsibilities without manually checking or reminding them.

### Imitate
1. **Set up a Cron node** to trigger daily at your desired time.
2. **Use the Notion node** to fetch tasks from your database.
3. **Add an If node** to check if tasks are assigned to a specific person and are incomplete.
4. **Create a Slack Direct Message node** to notify the person if they have tasks.
5. **Send the message** with relevant task details using another Slack node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to notify multiple people instead of just one. Create a list of team members and send them messages based on their assigned tasks. Test it with dummy data to ensure it works as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable automation services to clients, ensuring they never miss important tasks. This can lead to recurring income opportunities, as businesses will pay for reliable systems that enhance their productivity and efficiency.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Send a Direct Message" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
