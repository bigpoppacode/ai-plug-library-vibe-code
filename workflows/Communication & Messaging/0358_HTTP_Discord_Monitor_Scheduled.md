## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks a website's stock status every hour. If the product is "Out Of Stock," it sends a message to a Discord channel notifying the team; otherwise, it sends a different message indicating it's available.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor product availability on their e-commerce site. If a popular item is out of stock, they can react quickly by restocking or notifying customers, preventing lost sales.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger the workflow every hour.
2. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch stock data from your website.
3. Use an IF node to check if the response contains "Out Of Stock."
4. Connect Discord nodes to send messages based on the stock status.
5. Test the workflow to ensure notifications are sent correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to check the stock status of a different product or website. Change the HTTP Request URL and adjust the Discord messages accordingly. Test it to see if notifications are sent as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate stock monitoring, saving time and improving responsiveness. This skill can attract clients looking for e-commerce solutions, potentially generating income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTTP Request" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
