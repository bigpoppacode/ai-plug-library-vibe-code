## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting user feedback through Typeform. When a form is submitted, it checks the severity of the issue, logs it into Google Sheets, and sends notifications via email and Slack if the severity exceeds a certain threshold.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to manage customer support effectively. For example, if a user reports an issue with a severity score of 8, the workflow ensures it gets logged, and the support team is notified immediately via email and Slack for prompt action.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform to collect user feedback.
2. In n8n, create a workflow starting with the Typeform Trigger node.
3. Add an IF node to check if the severity is greater than 7.
4. Use a Google Sheets node to log the feedback.
5. Include Send Email and Slack nodes to notify the team.

### Practice
Create a Typeform with fields for name, email, problem description, and severity. Import the workflow into n8n and test it by submitting responses with varying severity scores. Observe how the workflow behaves based on the input.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline customer feedback management, enhancing responsiveness and improving customer satisfaction. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions, boosting your potential income as a consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Typeform Trigger" and "Slack" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
