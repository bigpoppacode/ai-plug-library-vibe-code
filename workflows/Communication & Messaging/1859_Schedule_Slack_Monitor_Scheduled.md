# Schedule Slack Monitor Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving set, if, airtop.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Define relevant products (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Found products? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Look up products (airtop)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Send slack message (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Trigger daily (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors ProductHunt for new AI-related products daily. It defines relevant products, checks if any are found, retrieves product details, and sends a Slack message with the results.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to track the latest AI tools and innovations. By automating this process, they can stay updated without manually checking ProductHunt, saving time and ensuring they don't miss opportunities.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily.
3. Use the **Set Node** to define relevant products (e.g., "AI Tools").
4. Add an **Airtop Node** to retrieve product info from ProductHunt.
5. Use an **If Node** to check if any products were found.
6. If products exist, add a **Slack Node** to send the details.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow for a different category, such as "Productivity Apps." Adapt the product search criteria in the **Set Node** and test the workflow to see if it retrieves and sends relevant updates to your Slack channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate product monitoring, saving time and enhancing your competitive edge in the market. This skill can help you deliver valuable insights to clients, potentially increasing your consulting fees and attracting more customers.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Define relevant products" and "Trigger daily" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
