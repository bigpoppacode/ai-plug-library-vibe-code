## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of evaluating candidate resumes. It triggers when a test is run, downloads a resume from Google Drive, converts it to an image, and uses an AI model to analyze whether the candidate is qualified for a role, offering a structured output.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline hiring. Instead of manually reviewing resumes, they can automate the process, saving time and ensuring consistent evaluations, thus speeding up the hiring cycle and improving candidate selection.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a trigger (e.g., Manual Trigger).
3. Configure Google Drive to download resumes.
4. Use an API to convert PDFs to images.
5. Integrate an AI model to evaluate the resumes, adjusting criteria as needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to analyze resumes from a different source, like an email attachment. Experiment with changing the AI evaluation criteria to see how it affects the output and decision-making process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable automation services. By streamlining resume evaluations, you can attract clients in HR and recruitment, ultimately increasing your income and expanding your service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
