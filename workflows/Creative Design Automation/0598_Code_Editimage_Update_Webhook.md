# Code EditImage Update Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, editImage, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Meta BG (editImage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Nest Top Meta (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Nest Bg Meta (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Calculate Center (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get Logo for the Watermark (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Get the Image for Background (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Wait for both Images and merge Binary in one Item (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Rename Image Binary Top Image (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Rename Image Binary Background Image (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Get Meta Top (editImage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Let "top" overlay "bg" (editImage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the process of overlaying a top image (like a watermark) onto a background image. It fetches both images, calculates their dimensions, and merges them to create a final composite image, streamlining image editing tasks.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer might use this workflow to automatically add a logo watermark to photos before uploading them online. This saves time, ensuring consistent branding without manual effort for each image.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Use HTTP Request nodes to fetch images (logo & background).
4. Add Code nodes to calculate overlay positions.
5. Use EditImage nodes to merge and save the final image.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to use different images or change the overlay position. Experiment with various image formats and see how the workflow adapts to those changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated image processing as a service. This can attract clients needing branding solutions, allowing you to scale your business and increase revenue by providing efficient, high-quality services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
