### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching new Twitter followers, resizing their profile images, and updating a user's Twitter banner with a collage of these images. It starts with a manual trigger, processes follower data, and uses image editing to create a visually appealing banner.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.

3. Use an HTTP Request node to fetch new followers from Twitter.
4. Process follower data with Item Lists and Function nodes.
5. Fetch and edit images using multiple HTTP Request and Image Edit nodes.
6. Merge images and upload the final banner via another HTTP Request node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch followers from a different social media platform (like Instagram) and create a new type of visual collage. Experiment with different image editing techniques (like adding text) to personalize the output further.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
