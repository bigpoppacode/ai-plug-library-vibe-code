# Graphql Webhook Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using graphql, function, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **Webhook** at `POST` **/webhook**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/webhook`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow receives a country code through a webhook, queries a GraphQL API to fetch details about the country, such as its name, phone code, and emoji, and then formats this information into a string. The final output is a message that includes the country's name, emoji, and phone code, which is then sent back in the webhook response.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to create a simple API for a travel website, allowing users to input a country code and receive information about that country for display on their site.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the webhook node and test it by sending a request with a country code.
3. Ensure the GraphQL node is querying the correct API endpoint.
4. Customize the Set node to format the output message as desired.
5. Test the workflow to confirm it returns the correct information.

### Practice
Create a webhook URL and test it by sending different country codes. Observe how the workflow responds with the country's details. Try modifying the Set node to include additional information, such as the country's capital, if available.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer custom API development services, enabling businesses to provide dynamic content based on user input. This skill can expand your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase your income potential in the automation and AI industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Expose Webhook:** Map your external app to the listed path/method; test with curl/Postman before activation.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
