# Graphql Discord Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Discord**.
  2. **Discord** `discord` — text: "=Here are the top 5 PH projects:
**Name:** {{$json["Name"]}}
**Description:** {{$json["Description"]}}
**Vote:** {{$json["Votes"]}}
-------", webhookUri: "DISCORD WEBHOOK URL"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically retrieves the top 5 trending projects from Product Hunt every hour using a GraphQL query. It then formats this data to extract the project's name, description, and vote count. Finally, it sends this information to a specified Discord channel using a webhook, keeping your community updated on the latest trends without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A tech community manager could use this workflow to keep their Discord channel updated with the latest trending projects from Product Hunt. This keeps the community engaged and informed about new innovations in the tech space.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Product Hunt API key and configure the GraphQL node.
3. Set your Discord webhook URL in the Discord node.
4. Activate the workflow to run hourly, or adjust the schedule as needed.
5. Test to ensure data is sent correctly to your Discord channel.

### Practice
Create a new Discord channel and use this workflow to post updates from a different source, like GitHub trending repositories. Adapt the GraphQL query and formatting to match the new data source.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you deliver real-time updates to clients or communities, enhancing engagement and authority. Offering such automation services can attract tech-savvy clients, allowing you to expand your automation business into new areas of interest.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
