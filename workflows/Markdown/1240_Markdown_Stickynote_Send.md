# Markdown Stickynote Send
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Email Trigger (IMAP)** `emailReadImap` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **OpenAI** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "320", height: "240", content: "Chain that summarizes the received email"
5. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "340", height: "240", content: "Agent that retrieves business information from a vector database and processes the response"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "240", content: "Convert email to Markdown format for better understanding of LLM models"
7. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — height: "180", content: "If the feedback is OK send email"
8. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
9. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "180", content: "Human in the loop"
10. **Sticky Note11** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "540", height: "260"
11. **Markdown** `markdown` — html: "={{ $json.textHtml }}", options: "[object Object]"
12. **Email Summarization Chain** `chainSummarization` — options: "[object Object]", operationMode: "nodeInputBinary"
13. **Write email** `agent` — text: "=Write the text to reply to the following email:

{{ $json.response.text }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
14. **Set Email text** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Approve Email** `emailSend` — operation: **sendAndWait**
16. **Approved?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
17. **Send Email** `emailSend` — html: "={{ $('Set Email text').item.json.email }}", options: "[object Object]", subject: "=Re: {{ $('Email Trigger (IMAP)').item.json.subject }}"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email handling by receiving emails via IMAP, converting them to Markdown for better AI comprehension, summarizing the email content using OpenAI, and drafting responses. It includes a human-in-the-loop step for approval before sending the response back via email.

### Demonstrate
A customer support team could use this workflow to streamline email inquiries, ensuring each email is summarized and responded to efficiently. This reduces response time and maintains high-quality communication with customers.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up IMAP credentials for your email.
3. Connect OpenAI to handle summarization and response drafting.
4. Customize email templates and approval steps.
5. Test with sample emails to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

### Practice
Create a test email account and send a few emails to it. Run the workflow to see how it summarizes and drafts responses. Adjust the approval criteria and test different email contents to observe workflow adaptability.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email handling services, reducing client workload and improving response times. This can enhance customer satisfaction and open up new revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, smtp, openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
