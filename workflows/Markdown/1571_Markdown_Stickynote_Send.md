# Markdown Stickynote Send
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Email Trigger (IMAP)** `emailReadImap` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **OpenAI** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "320", height: "240", content: "Chain that summarizes the received email"
5. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "340", height: "240", content: "Agent that retrieves business information from a vector database and processes the response"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "240", content: "Convert email to Markdown format for better understanding of LLM models"
7. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — height: "180", content: "If the feedback is OK send email"
8. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
9. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "180", content: "Human in the loop"
10. **Sticky Note11** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "540", height: "260"
11. **Markdown** `markdown` — html: "={{ $json.textHtml }}", options: "[object Object]"
12. **Email Summarization Chain** `chainSummarization` — options: "[object Object]", operationMode: "nodeInputBinary"
13. **Write email** `agent` — text: "=Write the text to reply to the following email:

{{ $json.response.text }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
14. **Set Email text** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Approve Email** `emailSend` — operation: **sendAndWait**
16. **Approved?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
17. **Send Email** `emailSend` — html: "={{ $('Set Email text').item.json.email }}", options: "[object Object]", subject: "=Re: {{ $('Email Trigger (IMAP)').item.json.subject }}"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates email management by reading incoming emails, summarizing them, and drafting a response using AI. It then allows a human to review and approve the response before sending it. This ensures efficient and accurate email handling with human oversight when needed.

**Demonstrate:**  
A customer support team could use this workflow to handle incoming email inquiries, summarize them for quick understanding, and draft responses, saving time and maintaining consistency in communication.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up your email account in the IMAP node.  
3. Configure the OpenAI node with your API key.  
4. Customize the workflow to match your email handling requirements.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it drafts and sends emails correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test email account and send various emails to it. Run the workflow to see how it summarizes and drafts responses. Modify the AI prompts to improve response quality and test again.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email management services, enhancing efficiency for clients. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, smtp, openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
