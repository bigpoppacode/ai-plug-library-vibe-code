# Asana Notion Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On update**.
  2. **On update** `asanaTrigger` — resource: **1202718722261680**
3. **Get unique tasks** `function` — functionCode: "const gids = [];

// get all the unique Asana task gids
for (item of items) {
  var gid = parseInt(item.json.resource.gid);
  var resource_type = item.json.resource.resource_type;
…[truncated]"
4. **Get tasks** `asana` — operation: **get**
5. **Find tasks** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**, operation: **getAll**
6. **Determine** `function` — functionCode: "const gids_to_update = [];
const database_ids = [];

for (item of $items("Find tasks")) {
  gids_to_update.push(parseInt(item.json.property_asana_gid));
  database_ids.push(item.js…[truncated]"
7. **Determine create/update** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Create task** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**
9. **Update task** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**, operation: **update**
10. **Check required fields exist** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **Update deadline** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**, operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the synchronization of tasks between Asana and Notion. When a task is updated in Asana, the workflow checks for unique task identifiers, retrieves task details, and compares them with existing tasks in Notion. If a task exists, it updates the task in Notion; if not, it creates a new task entry. This ensures both platforms remain consistent and up-to-date.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to ensure that task changes in Asana are automatically reflected in Notion, maintaining a single source of truth for project management. This reduces manual data entry and ensures team members have access to the most current task information.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Asana and Notion accounts.
3. Customize the Asana resource ID and Notion database ID to match your setup.
4. Set the workflow to listen for updates in Asana.
5. Test the workflow by updating a task in Asana and verifying the changes in Notion.

### Practice
Create a test Asana project and a corresponding Notion database. Update a task in Asana and run the workflow to ensure the changes appear in Notion. Experiment with adding new tasks in Asana to see how they're created in Notion.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can offer seamless integration services between popular productivity tools, enhancing team collaboration and efficiency. This expertise can attract clients looking for automated solutions, boosting your income and reputation in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, asanaApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
