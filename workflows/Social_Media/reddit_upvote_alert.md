# Reddit Upvote Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Reddit Upvote Alert", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/reddit-upvote-alert`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "reddit_upvote_alert"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "reddit_upvote_alert"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to monitor Reddit upvotes by receiving data via a webhook, processing it with AI, and storing the results. The process begins when a POST request is made to the webhook, which triggers the workflow. Data is split into manageable chunks and converted into vector embeddings. These embeddings are stored in and queried from a Weaviate vector database. A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent processes the data, and the results are appended to a Google Sheet. If an error occurs, a Slack alert is sent to notify the user.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically track and analyze Reddit engagement on their posts, gaining insights into user interactions and identifying trends, helping improve content strategy and audience engagement.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook in n8n with the path `/reddit-upvote-alert`.
2. Connect Weaviate and OpenAI accounts to n8n.
3. Configure the Google Sheet and Slack channels for data storage and alerts.
4. Test the workflow by sending a POST request to the webhook with sample Reddit data.
5. Review the Google Sheet for processed data and Slack for any error alerts.

### Practice
Create a test Reddit post and simulate upvotes by sending mock data to the webhook. Check how the workflow processes and logs this data in Google Sheets, and ensure Slack alerts are triggered for any errors.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer Reddit analytics as a service, helping clients optimize their content strategies and engagement metrics. This capability can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and increase revenue in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
