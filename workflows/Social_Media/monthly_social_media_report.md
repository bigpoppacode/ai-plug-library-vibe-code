# Monthly Social Media Report
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Monthly Social Media Report", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/monthly-social-media-report`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "monthly_social_media_report"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "monthly_social_media_report"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the generation of a Monthly Social Media Report. It begins with a Webhook Trigger that initiates the process when data is posted. The data is then processed through several nodes: it is split into chunks, embedded into vector format using OpenAI embeddings, and stored in Weaviate, a vector database. The workflow uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent to handle data and generate insights, which are appended to a Google Sheet. If an error occurs, a Slack alert is sent to notify the team.

**Demonstrate**  
A social media manager could use this workflow to automatically compile and analyze monthly social media data, generating insights and reports without manual intervention. This ensures timely and consistent reporting, allowing the manager to focus on strategy rather than data collection.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Set up the Webhook Trigger to receive social media data.
3. Connect your Weaviate and OpenAI accounts for vector storage and embedding.
4. Customize the Google Sheets node with your spreadsheet details.
5. Test by posting sample data to the webhook and verify the report generation.

**Practice**  
Create a test webhook in n8n and post mock social media data to it. Observe how data is processed through Weaviate and OpenAI, and check the resulting output in Google Sheets. Adjust the workflow to better suit your data needs and reporting format.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated reporting solutions to clients, enhancing their data-driven decision-making capabilities. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and retention, as well as opportunities to upsell other automation services, boosting your income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
