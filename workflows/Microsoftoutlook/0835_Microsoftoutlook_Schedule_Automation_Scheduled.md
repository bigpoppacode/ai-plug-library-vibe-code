# MicrosoftOutlook Schedule Automation Scheduled
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` ‚Äî rule: "[object Object]"
3. **MySQL** `mySql` ‚Äî operation: **executeQuery**
4. **Switch** `switch` ‚Äî rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
5. **Microsoft Outlook6** `microsoftOutlook` ‚Äî subject: "Project Cost Missing", bodyContent: "==<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Missing Budgeted Cost Notification</title>

  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to identify and notify relevant teams about projects with missing budgeted costs. It runs on a weekly schedule, queries a MySQL database for projects that are open, external, active, and have a budget of zero. Based on the cost center of each project, it sends a tailored email notification to the specified recipient via Microsoft Outlook, ensuring that the responsible team is informed and can take action to update the budget details.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to keep track of financial oversight. By automating the detection and notification of projects missing budget costs, the manager ensures that the finance team addresses these gaps promptly, maintaining accurate financial records and preventing budget-related delays.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your MySQL and Microsoft Outlook accounts.
3. Set up the MySQL query to match your project database structure.
4. Configure the switch node conditions for your cost centers.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends the correct emails based on the switch conditions.

### Practice
Create a test MySQL database table with sample project data, including different cost centers. Run the workflow and observe the emails sent based on project cost center conditions. Adjust the switch node rules to see how changes affect the email notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable project management automation services, ensuring financial compliance and efficiency. By providing timely notifications, you can enhance project oversight, reduce financial errors, and increase your value to clients, potentially leading to more business opportunities.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
