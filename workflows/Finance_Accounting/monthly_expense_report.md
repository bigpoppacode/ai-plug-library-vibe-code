# Monthly Expense Report
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Monthly Expense Report", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/monthly-expense-report`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "monthly_expense_report"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "monthly_expense_report"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the handling of monthly expense reports. It begins with a POST request to a webhook, which then processes the data using a text splitter and OpenAI embeddings. The data is stored in a Weaviate vector database for context and then analyzed by a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent. The results are appended to a Google Sheet, and any errors trigger a Slack alert.

### Demonstrate
A finance team could use this workflow to automate the collection and analysis of monthly expense data, ensuring accurate reporting and efficient data handling. This reduces manual data entry and analysis time, increasing productivity and accuracy.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Webhook Trigger with a POST method.
3. Connect Weaviate, OpenAI, and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Configure the Text Splitter and Embeddings nodes.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it appends results to Google Sheets correctly.

### Practice
Create a test scenario where you send sample expense data to the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the data and updates the Google Sheet. Modify the data to see how changes affect the output and error handling.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated financial data processing services, enhancing your service portfolio. By reducing manual errors and increasing efficiency, you can attract finance departments looking to streamline their reporting processes, potentially leading to new client engagements and increased revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
