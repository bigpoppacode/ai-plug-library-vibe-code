# Stripe To QuickBooks
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Stripe to QuickBooks", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/stripe-to-quickbooks`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "stripe_to_quickbooks"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "stripe_to_quickbooks"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow integrates Stripe and QuickBooks using a webhook trigger. It processes incoming data by splitting and embedding it, then stores this information in Supabase. The embedded data is queried, analyzed by an AI model, and logged into Google Sheets. If errors occur, alerts are sent via Slack.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automate invoice data transfer from Stripe to QuickBooks, ensuring accuracy and saving time on manual data entries. This reduces errors and streamlines accounting processes.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive data from Stripe.
3. Connect your Supabase and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Define how data should be processed and stored.
5. Test and modify the workflow to fit your specific data structure.

**Practice**  
Create a simple test webhook to simulate Stripe data. Run the workflow to see how it processes and logs data. Check Google Sheets for the output and adjust the workflow parameters if needed.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated accounting services to clients, reducing their manual workload and increasing your service offerings. This can help attract more clients and generate recurring income by providing value-added automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
