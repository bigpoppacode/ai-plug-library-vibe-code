# Currency Rate Monitor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Currency Rate Monitor", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/currency-rate-monitor`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "currency_rate_monitor"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "currency_rate_monitor"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors currency rates by receiving data through a webhook, processing it using AI tools, and storing the results. It starts with a Webhook Trigger to receive currency rate updates, processes the data using Weaviate for vector storage and querying, and uses OpenAI's chat model for analysis. The results are stored in a Google Sheet, and any errors trigger a Slack alert.

### Demonstrate
A financial advisor could use this workflow to automate currency rate monitoring, ensuring they receive real-time updates and insights. This helps in making informed trading decisions, reducing manual tracking, and improving response times to market changes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook Trigger to receive currency data.
3. Connect Weaviate for data storage and querying.
4. Use OpenAI for data processing and analysis.
5. Configure Google Sheets for result logging.
6. Test and activate the workflow.

### Practice
Create a mock currency rate update JSON and test the workflow by sending it to the webhook. Check how it processes the data and updates the Google Sheet. Modify the data and observe changes to see how the workflow handles different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated financial data monitoring services, enhancing your consulting offerings. It positions you as a tech-savvy advisor, attracting clients who value real-time insights and efficient data management, potentially leading to increased revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
