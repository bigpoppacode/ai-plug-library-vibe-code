# Splitout Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of tagging WordPress blog posts using AI. It monitors an RSS feed for new articles, generates suitable tags with OpenAI, checks existing tags in WordPress, and updates the post with the correct tags. It ensures articles are properly categorized, improving organization and searchability.

**Demonstrate:**  
A blogger can use this workflow to automatically tag new articles with relevant keywords, enhancing SEO and audience reach without manual input, saving time, and maintaining consistent tagging across their WordPress site.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up an n8n instance.
2. Connect to your RSS feed and WordPress API.
3. Use the OpenAI integration for tag generation.
4. Implement the workflow to fetch, process, and update articles.
5. Test with a few articles to ensure proper tagging.

**Practice:**  
Create a test WordPress site and RSS feed. Set the workflow to monitor the feed and auto-tag new posts. Experiment with different content to see how well the AI suggests tags and updates them on WordPress.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can streamline content management for clients, offering automated SEO optimization services. This can attract more customers, enhance service offerings, and generate steady income in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, wordpressApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
