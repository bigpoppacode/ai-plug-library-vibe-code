# Splitout Code Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×13, set×6, httpRequest×4.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **And every Sunday** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **When this workflow is activated** `n8nTrigger` — events: "activate"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "2909.758966302104", height: "1357.9229992534551"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "190.3269519041407", height: "172.4182620239646"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "150", height: "135.16347595207057"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "345.30539364962834", height: "100.16655570271519"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "320.4824213076102", height: "97.51953145794394"
9. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "188.64373499228745", height: "206.54161516323953"
10. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "502.4185703091201", height: "243.8281544043028"
11. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "180.46986136506064", height: "135.95151736720237"
12. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "434.64763783570623", height: "447.49544828389617"
13. **When viewed in a browser** `webhook` — path: `/dependency-graph`
14. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "502.4185703091201", height: "243.8281544043028"
15. **Sticky Note10** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "180.46986136506064", height: "135.95151736720237"
16. **Sticky Note11** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "653.2415806326139", height: "140.62930090784633"
17. **Sticky Note12** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "266.5295926113459", height: "95.5709893724457"
18. **GET all workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
19. **List callers of subworkflows** `code` — jsCode: "const workflows = $input.all();
const dependencyGraph = {};

// Helper function to initialize a workflow entry
const getOrCreateWorkflowEntry = (id, name, tags) => {
  if (!depende…[truncated]"
20. **Exclude uncalled workflows** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
21. **GET workflow(s)** `n8n` — operation: **get**
22. **Exclude missing workflows** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
23. **Count callers and identify new callers** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to analyze and visualize dependencies between workflows within an n8n instance. It identifies which workflows are called by others (subworkflows), constructs a dependency graph, and automatically tags subworkflows with their calling workflows. This helps users understand workflow relationships, optimize organization, and maintain documentation in complex environments.

- **Demonstrate:** A developer at a company with multiple automated processes can use this workflow to map out dependencies between workflows. This ensures that updates or changes to one workflow do not inadvertently affect others, improving the stability and maintainability of the system.

- **Imitate:** 1) Import the workflow into your n8n instance. 2) Set up n8n API credentials. 3) Replace instance_url in the workflow with your instance URL. 4) Activate the workflow to automatically generate and visualize a dependency graph of your workflows.

- **Practice:** Create a few simple workflows that call each other and activate this workflow to see how it visualizes dependencies. Modify one workflow to call a new subworkflow and observe the changes in the graph.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable insights into workflow dependencies for clients, ensuring system stability and efficiency. This expertise can lead to increased client trust, opportunities for consultation, and potential income as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
