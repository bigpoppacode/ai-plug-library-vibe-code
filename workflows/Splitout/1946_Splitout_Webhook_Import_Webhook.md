# Splitout Webhook Import Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using respondToWebhook×6, code×5, stickyNote×3.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/a6767312-3a4c-4819-b4fe-a03c9e0ade5c`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1000", height: "1080"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "960", height: "660", content: "# Usage in an External App or Another Workflow

To integrate this part of the workflow into your application or another workflow:

1. **Send a POST Request:**
   Use the Get Scalwa…[truncated]"
5. **Get Scalway Machines** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://sup-n8n.unipile.com/webhook/209dd6cb-76cf-4841-8c79-cea45a742b39`
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "580", height: "380"
7. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Loop Over Items** `splitInBatches` — options: "[object Object]"
9. **Split Out ZONE_INSTANCE** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "ZONE_INSTANCE"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This workflow retrieves information about Scaleway servers from specified zones. It uses a webhook to trigger the process, collects server data via API requests, and structures the information. The workflow allows filtering based on criteria like name, tags, public IP, or zone, and returns the filtered data via a webhook response.

- **Demonstrate:** A cloud service provider might use this workflow to manage and monitor their server inventory efficiently, ensuring that they can quickly access specific server details based on user-defined criteria, thus optimizing server management tasks.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow to n8n. Connect your Scaleway account. Set up a webhook to receive POST requests with filtering criteria. Customize the Scaleway API credentials in the Edit Fields node. Test the workflow by sending requests to the webhook and verify the filtered server data response.

- **Practice:** Create a test scenario by sending a POST request to the workflow's webhook with different search criteria (e.g., search by tags or zone). Observe how the workflow processes the request and returns the filtered data. Experiment with changing the filtering parameters to see different outputs.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer robust server management solutions, helping clients efficiently manage their cloud resources. This expertise can lead to new business opportunities and income streams by providing scalable automation services in the cloud infrastructure domain.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
