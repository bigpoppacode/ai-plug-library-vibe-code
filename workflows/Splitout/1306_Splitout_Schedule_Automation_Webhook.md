# Splitout Schedule Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Request Hugging Face Paper** `httpRequest` — url: `https://huggingface.co/papers`
4. **Extract Hugging Face Paper** `html` — operation: **extractHtmlContent**
5. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "url, url"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching and analyzing research papers from Hugging Face. It runs on a schedule, retrieves the latest paper URLs, checks if they exist in a Notion database, analyzes the paper abstracts using OpenAI to extract key details, and then stores the extracted information back into Notion for easy access and review.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer could use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze the latest AI research papers, ensuring they stay updated with new advancements without manual effort.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Notion and OpenAI accounts.  
3. Schedule the workflow to run on weekdays at 8 AM.  
4. Customize the Notion database details to match your setup.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly fetches, analyzes, and stores paper details.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Notion database and run the workflow with a few sample URLs. Verify if the workflow correctly updates the database with the analyzed paper abstracts and extracted information.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow helps you automate the process of staying informed about the latest research, saving you time and effort. By offering this as a service, you can help clients enhance their research capabilities, potentially generating income through consulting or subscription services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
