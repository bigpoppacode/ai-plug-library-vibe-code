# Splitout Converttofile Send Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

5. **Trigger- Watches For new URL in Spreadsheet** `googleSheetsTrigger` — event: "rowAdded", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
6. **Scrape Website Content with Dumpling AI** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://app.dumplingai.com/api/v1/scrape`
7. **Extract all books from the page** `html` — operation: **extractHtmlContent**
8. **Split HTML Array into Individual Books** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "books"
9. **Extract individual book price** `html` — operation: **extractHtmlContent**
10. **Sort by price** `sort` — options: "[object Object]", sortFieldsUi: "[object Object]"
11. **Convert to CSV File** `convertToFile` — options: "[object Object]"
12. **Send CSV via e-mail** `gmail` — sendTo: "", message: "Hey, here's the scraped data from the online bookstore!", options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping book data from a website. It starts by monitoring a Google Sheet for new URLs. When a new URL is added, the workflow uses Dumpling AI to scrape the website's content. It then extracts book details, including their prices, sorts them by price, converts the data into a CSV file, and emails the CSV to a specified address. This helps streamline data collection and analysis, saving time on manual data extraction.

**Demonstrate**  
A book retailer could use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze competitors' book prices from online stores, enabling them to adjust pricing strategies dynamically.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect Google Sheets, Dumpling AI, and Gmail accounts.  
3. Set up a Google Sheet with URLs to monitor.  
4. Customize the Dumpling AI node with your target website's URL structure.  
5. Run the workflow to test data extraction and email delivery.

**Practice**  
Create a Google Sheet with URLs of book pages, then run the workflow. Check the email for the CSV file and verify that book data is correctly extracted and sorted by price.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data extraction and analysis services to clients, enhancing their market intelligence and decision-making capabilities. This can increase your value as a consultant, leading to more business opportunities and income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, googleSheetsTriggerOAuth2Api, httpBasicAuth, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
