## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates user interviews using AI. It starts by capturing the interviewee's name via a form, sets the interview topic, and uses an AI agent to generate questions. The interviewee's responses are recorded and stored in a Redis database, and the interview continues until the user opts to stop. The entire session, including questions and answers, is saved to Google Sheets for analysis. The workflow also provides a completion screen with the interview transcript.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business could use this workflow to conduct automated interviews for customer feedback, saving time on manual interviews and ensuring consistent data collection, which can then be analyzed to improve services or products.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a form to capture the interviewee's name and start the interview.
3. Configure the AI agent to generate questions based on your interview topic.
4. Store responses in a Redis database and push them to Google Sheets.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it functions correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a mock interview scenario where you ask questions about user experience with a product. Run the workflow with a test participant and review the transcript to understand how the data is collected and stored.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated interview services, providing scalable solutions for businesses seeking to gather customer insights efficiently. It enhances your service portfolio, potentially increasing client engagement and revenue opportunities.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** redis, groqApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
