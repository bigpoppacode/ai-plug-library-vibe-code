# Splitout Schedule Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Request Hugging Face Paper** `httpRequest` — url: `https://huggingface.co/papers`
4. **Extract Hugging Face Paper** `html` — operation: **extractHtmlContent**
5. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "url, url"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of fetching and analyzing research papers from the Hugging Face website. It retrieves paper URLs daily, checks if they are already stored in Notion, and if not, extracts their details. The workflow uses OpenAI to analyze paper abstracts, extracting key details and generating a structured summary. The extracted data is then stored in a Notion database for easy access and reference.

### Demonstrate
A research team could use this workflow to keep track of the latest developments in AI by automatically summarizing new papers from Hugging Face. This saves time on manual searches and ensures the team stays updated with minimal effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Hugging Face and Notion accounts.
3. Schedule the trigger to run daily.
4. Map the Notion database fields to match your storage needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and processes papers correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Notion database and run the workflow with a few sample papers from Hugging Face. Check how the data is stored and summarized. Adjust any settings to better fit your specific research needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated research paper summarization services, saving clients time and enhancing their research capabilities. This can lead to increased efficiency in research processes and potential new business opportunities in the AI and academic sectors.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
