# Splitout Filter Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, manualTrigger, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **‘Test workflow’ trigger**.
2. **‘Test workflow’ trigger** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "150", height: "240"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "150", height: "240"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "540", height: "300"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "280", height: "420", content: "## Sitemap.xml reader
This workflow reads an sitemap.xml and filters out the entries you want.

By default only PDF documents are returned at the end of the workflow.

**SETUP**
- …[truncated]"
7. **Set sitemap URL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Get Sitemap** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.sitemapUrl }}`
9. **Convert Sitemap to JSON** `xml` — options: "[object Object]"
10. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "urlset.url"
11. **Filter URLs** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to read a sitemap.xml file, convert it into a JSON format, and filter the URLs to only return entries that end with ".pdf". It starts with a manual trigger, sets a sitemap URL, fetches the sitemap, converts it from XML to JSON, splits the URLs, and filters them based on the file extension.

### Demonstrate
A content management team could use this workflow to automate the process of retrieving PDF documents from a website's sitemap, ensuring they only focus on downloading relevant files for archiving or further processing.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your desired sitemap URL in the "Set sitemap URL" node.
3. Customize the filter conditions to match your requirements (e.g., different file types).
4. Test the workflow by running it manually to ensure it correctly filters the URLs.

### Practice
Create a sitemap.xml file with various URLs, including some ending in ".pdf". Run the workflow and observe how it filters out only the PDF URLs. Adjust the filter to try different file types and see how the results change.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage and extract specific content from large datasets, which can be a valuable service for businesses needing to organize and process web resources, enhancing your offerings and potentially increasing revenue in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
