# Splitout Code Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using n8n×3, stickyNote×3, splitOut×3.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "220", content: "### Change the Destination Project by changing the Project Name"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "220", content: "### Change the Source n8n Instance by changing the Credential"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "220", content: "### Change the Destination n8n Instance by changing the Credential"
6. **GET - Workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
7. **GET - Destination Workflows** `n8n` — limit: "200", filters: "[object Object]", returnAll: "false"
8. **Split Out Workflows** `splitOut` — include: "allOtherFields", options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "id"
9. **Split Out Workflows1** `splitOut` — include: "allOtherFields", options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "id"
10. **Merge Workflows** `merge` — mode: "combineBySql", query: "SELECT input1.name, input1.createdAt, input1.updatedAt, input1.active, input1.nodes, input1.settings, input1.connections, input1.pinData, input1.tags, input1.id
FROM input1
LEFT JO…[truncated]"
11. **Code** `code` — jsCode: "const data = $json;
console.log("Merged Output:", data);
return [data];
"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This workflow automates the process of cloning workflows between different n8n instances. It retrieves workflows from a source instance, checks for existing workflows in a destination instance, merges data to identify new workflows, and transfers them to the destination project. It ensures seamless replication and organization of workflows across instances.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer could use this workflow to efficiently migrate workflows from a development environment to a production environment, ensuring that all tested automations are correctly replicated without manual intervention, saving time and reducing errors.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set your source and destination n8n instance credentials.  
3. Adjust the project names as needed in the sticky notes.  
4. Test the workflow using the manual trigger.  
5. Verify that workflows have been cloned successfully.

**Practice**  
Create a test workflow in your source n8n instance. Run the cloning workflow and check the destination instance to ensure the workflow appears there. Try modifying the test workflow and re-running the clone to observe changes.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer migration and synchronization services for businesses using n8n, streamlining their operations. This capability can enhance your service portfolio, attract more clients, and generate additional revenue streams in automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
