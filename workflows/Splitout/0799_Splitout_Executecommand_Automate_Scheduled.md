# Splitout Executecommand Automate Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using set×2, manualTrigger, splitOut.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **trigger_manual**.
2. **trigger_manual** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **trigger_schedule** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **trigger_instance** `n8nTrigger` — events: "init"
5. **libraries_set** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **libraries_array** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
7. **libraries_split** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "libraries"
8. **library_install** `executeCommand` — command: "=#!/bin/bash

# Get library name from variable
LIBRARY_NAME="{{$json.library}}"

# Check if library directory exists
LIBRARY_DIR="/home/node/node_modules/$LIBRARY_NAME"

# Check if…[truncated]", executeOnce: "false"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the installation of specific JavaScript libraries. It begins with a trigger (either manual, scheduled, or instance-based) to set a list of libraries. The list is split into individual library names, and for each name, a command checks if the library is installed in the specified directory. If not, it installs the library using npm, ensuring the required libraries are available for use.

- **Demonstrate:** A developer setting up a new project might use this workflow to automate the installation of necessary libraries like Axios, Cheerio, and Node-Fetch, ensuring a consistent setup across different environments without manual intervention.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect to your environment where libraries should be installed. 3. Customize the list of libraries in the `libraries_set` node. 4. Run the workflow manually or set a schedule to automate the installation process regularly.

- **Practice:** Create a test environment and use this workflow to install a few libraries. Modify the list, run the workflow, and check if the libraries are correctly installed. Experiment with adding and removing libraries to see how the workflow adapts.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage dependencies in software projects, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can be a valuable service to offer in automation consulting, helping clients streamline their development processes and improve productivity.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
