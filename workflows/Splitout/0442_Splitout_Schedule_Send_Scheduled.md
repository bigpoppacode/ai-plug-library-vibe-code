# Splitout Schedule Send Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Every 1 hour** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "84"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "447", height: "104.61602497398542"
5. **List of RSS feeds** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "urls"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically checks RSS feeds every hour for new posts. It retrieves content from specified RSS URLs, checks if the posts were published in the last hour, and sends an email notification for each new post. This ensures users are promptly updated about new content from their favorite feeds.

### Demonstrate
A content aggregator might use this workflow to monitor various blogs and news sites, ensuring they are always up-to-date with the latest posts, which can then be shared with their audience or used in their content curation strategy.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Add your RSS feed URLs in the "List of RSS feeds" node.
3. Set your email address in the "Send email with each post" node.
4. Activate the workflow to run every hour.
5. Test by checking your email for updates on new posts.

### Practice
Create a list of three RSS feeds you frequently visit. Add these to the workflow and run it. Check how it processes each feed and sends emails only for new posts. Adjust the email template to better suit your notification style.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer real-time content monitoring and alerting services. By automating content updates, you can provide clients with timely insights, improving engagement and potentially increasing revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
