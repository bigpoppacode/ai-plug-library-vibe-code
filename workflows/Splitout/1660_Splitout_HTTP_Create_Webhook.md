## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow generates new keywords for SEO campaigns by using Google Ads API. It starts with a trigger, sets the keywords, sends them to Google Ads to generate keyword ideas with search volumes, splits out the results, edits the fields to include relevant metrics, and appends the data to a Google Sheet for further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A digital marketing agency could use this workflow to regularly update their keyword strategy, ensuring they target the most effective terms based on search volume and competition, thereby optimizing their clients' ad spend and improving campaign performance.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your trigger (manual or webhook).
3. Configure the `Set Keywords` node with your keyword list.
4. Update the Google Ads API node with your credentials and customer ID.
5. Connect Google Sheets to store the results.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it generates and stores keywords correctly.

### Practice
Create a small list of keywords relevant to a niche market. Run the workflow to generate keyword ideas using the Google Ads API. Review the output in Google Sheets and analyze the competition and search volume of each keyword to determine their potential effectiveness in a campaign.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer a dynamic keyword research service, enhancing your SEO capabilities and attracting more clients. By providing data-driven insights, you can improve campaign outcomes, leading to increased client satisfaction and potentially higher revenue in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleAdsOAuth2Api, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
