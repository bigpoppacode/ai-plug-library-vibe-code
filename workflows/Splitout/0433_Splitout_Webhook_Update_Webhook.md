# Splitout Webhook Update Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using respondToWebhook×2, webhook, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **If Webhook Trigger has URL query**.
2. **Incoming Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — path: `/eu-exchange-rate`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "431.3108108108107", height: "424.89189189189204", content: "## Note
* The HTTP request adds a randomized URL parameter to ensure getting the latest data by prevent caching.
* The provided data is XML-formatted and therefore converted to JSO…[truncated]"
4. **Get latest Euro exchange rates** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml?" + Math.floor(Math.random() * (999999999 - 100000000 + 1)) + 100000000 }}`
5. **Convert XML to JSON** `xml` — options: "[object Object]"
6. **Split Out Data** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "['gesmes:Envelope'].Cube.Cube.Cube"
7. **If Webhook Trigger has URL query** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Filter the currency symbol** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
9. **Respond All Items** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "allIncomingItems"
10. **Respond Asked Item** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain**: This n8n workflow retrieves the latest Euro exchange rates from the European Central Bank whenever triggered by a webhook. It converts the data from XML to JSON, checks for specific currency queries in the URL, filters the relevant currency rates, and responds with either all data or the requested currency rate, depending on the query.

- **Demonstrate**: A financial consultant could use this workflow to provide clients with up-to-date Euro exchange rates. By integrating this with their web app, clients can request specific currency rates on demand, ensuring they have the latest data for financial decisions.

- **Imitate**: Import the workflow into n8n, set up a webhook trigger with a specified path, and ensure the HTTP Request node retrieves data from the ECB. Customize the currency filter to match your needs and test the workflow by sending requests with different currency queries.

- **Practice**: Create a test webhook and send requests with various currency queries. Observe how the workflow processes each request and returns the relevant exchange rate. Modify currency symbols to verify that the filtering works correctly.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time currency exchange rate services, enhancing your business offerings. This can attract clients who need accurate financial data, potentially increasing your revenue and client base in the finance sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
