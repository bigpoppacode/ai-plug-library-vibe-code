# Splitout Github Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, manualTrigger, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "320", height: "420", content: "## Restore from GitHub 
This workflow will restore all instance workflows from GitHub backups.


### Setup
Open `Globals` node and update the values below 👇

- **repo.owner:** you…[truncated]"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "150", height: "80"
5. **Globals** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **Get all files in given path** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.github.com/repos/{{ $json.repo.owner }}/{{ $json.repo.name }}/contents/{{ $json.repo.path }}`
7. **Split the result** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "path"
8. **Get file content from GitHub** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **get**
9. **Convert files to JSON** `extractFromFile` — operation: **fromJson**
10. **Restore n8n Workflows** `n8n` — operation: **create**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to restore workflows from a GitHub repository backup. It begins with a manual trigger, retrieves all files from a specified GitHub repository path, splits the file paths, fetches each file's content, converts them from JSON, and finally restores the workflows in n8n. This ensures that you have a backup and recovery system for your n8n workflows, providing a way to quickly restore them if needed.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to ensure their n8n workflows are backed up on GitHub. This way, if the main system fails or needs a reset, they can quickly restore all workflows from the latest backup, minimizing downtime and data loss.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the `Globals` node with your GitHub repository details.
3. Connect your GitHub account for API access.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and restores workflows correctly.
5. Schedule regular executions to keep backups up-to-date.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository with a few sample workflows in JSON format. Run the workflow to see how it retrieves and restores these workflows in your n8n instance. Experiment by modifying a workflow, then restoring it to its original state.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can position you as an automation expert who ensures data safety and quick recovery for businesses. Offering this as a service can attract clients needing reliable backup solutions, enhancing your portfolio and generating income through backup and recovery services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi, n8nApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
