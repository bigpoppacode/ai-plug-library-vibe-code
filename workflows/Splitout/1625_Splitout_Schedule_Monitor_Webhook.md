# Splitout Schedule Monitor Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "340", height: "420", content: "## Modify the Query Parameter

**Double-click** the node to open it for editing.

Adjust the value of the "q" parameter to match the keyword you wish to monitor.



"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "340", height: "420", content: "## Add your Google Sheets API credentials

**Double-click** the node to open it for editing.

Select the document from the list. Please note to add columns "id", "date", "title", "…[truncated]"
5. **Google Sheets Trigger** `googleSheetsTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "580", height: "600", content: "## Send a message when Sheet is updated (Optional)

### Delete these nodes if you don't want to be alerted.

You can configure channels you want to connect, when Google Sheet is up…[truncated]"
7. **Get latest topics** `httpRequest` — url: `https://community.n8n.io/search`
8. **Slack** `slack` — text: "New topics are available in n8n community", otherOptions: "[object Object]"
9. **Send Email** `emailSend` — text: "New topics are available in n8n community.", options: "[object Object]", emailFormat: "text"
10. **Get topics** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "topics"
11. **Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — operation: **appendOrUpdate**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow tracks new topics in the n8n community forum that match a specified keyword. It periodically checks for new topics using a schedule trigger, retrieves the latest topics via an HTTP request, and stores these in Google Sheets. It also sends notifications via Slack and email when new topics are detected.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer might use this workflow to stay updated on discussions about a specific feature or bug in the n8n community. By automatically tracking relevant topics, they can quickly respond to or learn from community insights, enhancing their development process.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the schedule trigger to define how often the workflow should run.  
3. Modify the HTTP request node to include your desired keyword.  
4. Connect your Google Sheets, Slack, and email accounts.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates the sheet and sends notifications correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test Google Sheet and Slack channel, then run the workflow with a common keyword. Observe how new topics are added to the sheet and how notifications are sent. Adjust the keyword or notification settings to see different results.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable topic-tracking services to community managers or developers, allowing them to engage with relevant discussions promptly. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and potential revenue streams in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, googleSheetsTriggerOAuth2Api, smtp.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
