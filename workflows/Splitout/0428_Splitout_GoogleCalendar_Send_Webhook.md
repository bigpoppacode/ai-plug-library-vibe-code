## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This workflow is designed to automatically gather and send social media activity for companies you have meetings with. Every morning at 7 AM, it checks your Google Calendar for meetings, retrieves the email domains of the attendees, and uses Clearbit to enrich company information. It then fetches recent LinkedIn posts and tweets for these companies, formats this data, and sends it to specified email addresses as a report.

**Demonstrate**: A business owner can use this workflow to prepare for meetings by receiving daily updates on the social media activities of the companies they'll meet. This keeps them informed and ready to engage with relevant topics.

**Imitate**: 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google Calendar and email credentials.
3. Configure your LinkedIn and Twitter API keys in the Setup node.
4. Adjust the meeting email list.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and sends the data correctly.

**Practice**: Create a test meeting in Google Calendar with an email domain you control. Run the workflow and check your email for the formatted social media report. Modify some parameters to see how changes affect the output.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a valuable service to clients, providing them with automated insights into their business meetings. This can enhance client relationships, improve meeting preparedness, and increase the value of your automation offerings, potentially leading to more clients and higher income.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
