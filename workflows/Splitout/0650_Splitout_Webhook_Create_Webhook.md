# Splitout Webhook Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

  "response_action": "clear"
}"
15. **Idea Selector Modal** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://slack.com/api/views.open`
16. **Route Message1** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
17. **Route Action** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
18. **Create Folder** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://slack.com/api/views.push`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This workflow is designed to automate the process of uploading images from Slack to an S3 bucket. It starts by receiving a POST request from a Slack interaction via a webhook. The workflow parses the incoming data and routes messages based on specific conditions. It opens a modal in Slack for users to select or create a folder for the image upload. The workflow then splits the input files, downloads them, and uploads each file to an S3 bucket. Success or failure responses are sent back to Slack, ensuring the user is informed of the outcome.

**Demonstrate:** A marketing team could use this workflow to streamline the process of uploading promotional images shared on Slack to a central S3 storage, ensuring all team members have access to the latest assets.

**Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n. Set up a Slack app with the necessary permissions and configure the webhook in Slack to point to the workflow's URL. Connect your S3 credentials in n8n. Adjust the Slack modal configuration to match your team's folder structure preferences. Test the workflow with a sample file upload.

**Practice:** Create a test Slack workspace and channel. Use the workflow to upload a set of sample images. Verify that the images are correctly uploaded to the specified S3 bucket and that Slack notifications reflect the upload status.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer seamless integration between Slack and S3 for clients, enhancing their content management processes. This capability can be marketed as a value-added service, potentially leading to new client engagements and increased revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, s3.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
