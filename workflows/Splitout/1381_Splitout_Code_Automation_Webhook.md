# Splitout Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note4**.
2. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — content: "[redacted]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reviewing code changes in GitLab. It starts with a webhook that triggers whenever a code review is needed. The workflow fetches the code changes from GitLab, analyzes the difference between the old and new code, and uses OpenAI to generate a review report. The review decision, along with comments, is then posted back to the GitLab merge request discussion.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to automate code reviews, ensuring consistent feedback and saving time. It helps maintain code quality by leveraging AI to provide detailed analysis and recommendations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the Webhook to connect with your GitLab repository.
3. Set up your GitLab URL and token in the workflow.
4. Connect OpenAI for generating review comments.
5. Test the workflow with a sample merge request.

### Practice
Create a test GitLab repository with a few code changes. Trigger the workflow by creating a merge request. Observe how the workflow fetches changes, processes them, and posts AI-generated reviews. Adjust parameters to customize the review output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated code review services, enhancing software quality for clients. This expertise can attract tech companies seeking efficient code management solutions, potentially increasing your revenue and client base in the AI automation sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
