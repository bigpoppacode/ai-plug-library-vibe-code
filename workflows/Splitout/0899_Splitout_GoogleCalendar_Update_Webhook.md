# Splitout GoogleCalendar Update Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Calendar Trigger**.
2. **Google Calendar Trigger** `googleCalendarTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]", triggerOn: "eventCreated"
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "880", height: "700"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1120", height: "700"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1120", height: "580"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "310", height: "200", content: "## Edit Here
Edit a few variables here to get started:
- **context**: Some information about you to help the web search return the right people. 
- **email**: The email that you wa…[truncated]"
7. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Split Out Attendees** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "=attendees"
9. **Filter Out Myself** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the collection of attendee information from new Google Calendar events. When a new event is created, it triggers a process to gather details about each attendee using OpenAI's API. It checks if their email is from a company domain, researches their company, and compiles a report with all findings. Finally, the report is sent via email, offering insights on meeting participants and their affiliations.

### Demonstrate
A consultant preparing for a meeting can use this workflow to gather background information on attendees, enabling more informed conversations and tailored engagement strategies.

### Imitate
1. Set up and connect your Google Calendar, OpenAI, and Gmail accounts in n8n.
2. Import the workflow.
3. Customize the email and context fields in the "Edit Fields" node.
4. Test the workflow by creating a new event in your Google Calendar.
5. Verify the report is sent to your email with accurate attendee data.

### Practice
Create a mock event in your Google Calendar with a few test attendees. Run the workflow and examine the report email for accuracy. Adjust the context to see how it influences the research results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your client offerings by providing valuable insights for meeting preparations, leading to better client relationships and the potential for increased revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, googleCalendarOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
