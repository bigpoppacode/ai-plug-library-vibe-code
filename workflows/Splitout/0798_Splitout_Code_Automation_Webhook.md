# Splitout Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using readWriteFile×2, splitOut, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **PDF Array** `code` — jsCode: "return { data: [
  "https://www.intewa.com/fileadmin/documents/pdf-file.pdf", "https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf"
]}"
4. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "data"
5. **HTTP Request1** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.data }}`
6. **Merge PDF** `mergePdfs` — configured for its default action.
7. **Read/Write Files from Disk2** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
8. **Read/Write Files from Disk3** `readWriteFile` — options: "[object Object]", fileSelector: "test.pdf"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading, merging, and saving PDF files. It begins with a manual trigger, then retrieves a list of PDF URLs. Each URL is processed to download the PDF files, which are then merged into a single document. Finally, the merged PDF is saved to disk as "test.pdf". This process simplifies handling multiple PDFs by combining them into one file for easier access and management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to compile multiple invoices or reports into a single document for streamlined record-keeping and sharing with clients or stakeholders, thus saving time and reducing manual errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Update the PDF URLs in the "PDF Array" node with your own.
4. Run the workflow to download, merge, and save the PDFs as a single file.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by using URLs of publicly available PDFs. Run the workflow and verify that the PDFs are correctly merged and saved. Experiment with different PDF combinations to see how the workflow handles them.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer PDF management solutions to businesses, enhancing document handling efficiency. This can attract clients needing automated document processing, allowing you to expand your automation services and increase revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** customJsApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
