# Splitout Noop Send Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
2. **Gmail Trigger** `gmailTrigger` — simple: "false", filters: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "380", height: "820", content: "## Reference "Single" Binary Using Expressions
This contains examples of how to reference a single binary in each input item **regardless of its key name.**"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "260", height: "460", content: "## Split Multiple Binary Files
This uses the `$binary` name (not expression var) to make individual items for each attachment binary.
* Note: This still doesn't homogenize the name…[truncated]"
5. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "$binary"
6. **Switch** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
7. **Send " Too Big" Notification (for example)** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
8. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — name: "={{ $binary.values()[0].fileName }}", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Ignore Little Graphics / Icons (for example)** `noOp` — configured for its default action.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling email attachments received in Gmail. It starts with a Gmail trigger that detects new unread emails from a specific sender. Attachments from these emails are split into individual items. The workflow then uses a switch to categorize these attachments based on their size. Large files trigger a notification, while medium-sized files are uploaded to a specified folder in Google Drive. Smaller files are ignored.

### Demonstrate
A business owner receiving frequent large files via email can use this workflow to automatically manage file storage and notifications, ensuring that important files are saved and appropriately handled without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail and Google Drive accounts.
3. Set up the Gmail trigger to monitor a specific sender.
4. Define size conditions in the switch node.
5. Test the workflow by sending emails with attachments to see how they are categorized and processed.

### Practice
Create a test Gmail account and send emails with various attachment sizes to see how the workflow processes them. Adjust the size conditions and observe the changes in behavior, ensuring files are correctly categorized and stored.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline your email attachment management, saving time and reducing clutter. Offering this automation service to clients can enhance your business offerings, helping them efficiently manage digital assets and improve organizational workflows, potentially increasing your revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, googleDriveOAuth2Api.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
