# Splitout Snowflake Import Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "442.66083354762577", height: "155.09952210536395"
3. **[CREATE] PRODUCTBOARD_NOTES** `snowflake` — operation: **executeQuery**
4. **[CREATE] PRODUCTBOARD_COMPANIES** `snowflake` — operation: **executeQuery**
5. **[CREATE] PRODUCTBOARD_NOTES_FEATURES** `snowflake` — operation: **executeQuery**
6. **[CREATE] PRODUCTBOARD_FEATURES** `snowflake` — operation: **executeQuery**
7. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "983.4896175671602", height: "314.88047081122676"
9. **Empty Table Productboard Features** `snowflake` — operation: **executeQuery**
10. **get productboard features** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.productboard.com/features`
11. **Split features** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "data"
12. **Manual mapping feature** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", include: "none", options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This workflow automates the process of importing data from Productboard into Snowflake. It retrieves features, notes, and companies from Productboard via API calls, processes them, and updates respective tables in Snowflake. It runs weekly and sends a Slack notification summarizing new and unprocessed insights.

- **Demonstrate:** A product manager could use this workflow to keep their Snowflake database updated with the latest Productboard data for analytical purposes. This ensures that decision-making is based on the most current insights, improving strategic planning and product development.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your Productboard and Snowflake accounts. 3. Set the schedule trigger to your desired frequency. 4. Ensure the Snowflake tables are set up as per the workflow. 5. Test the workflow to confirm data is imported and processed correctly.

- **Practice:** Set up a test environment with mock Productboard data and Snowflake tables. Run the workflow and verify that data is correctly imported and processed. Adjust the Slack notification to include additional metrics or insights if needed.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data integration services to clients, enhancing their data analysis capabilities. This can lead to more informed business decisions, increased efficiency, and potential revenue growth by providing valuable insights and automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, snowflake, slackApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
