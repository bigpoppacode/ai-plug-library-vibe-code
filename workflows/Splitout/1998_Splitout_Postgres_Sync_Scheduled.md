# Splitout Postgres Sync Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "485.5994596522446", height: "350.08576009540855", content: "## Setup ##
In order to make this automation work for you, you need to make a few adjustments:

1. Add your Postgres & Google Sheets Credentials to the respective Nodes

2. Select …[truncated]"

Get the Data you want to compare and split out the relevant fields"
6. **Retrieve Sheets Data** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
7. **Select Rows in Postgres** `postgres` — operation: **select**, table: `[object Object]`
8. **Split Out Relevant Fields** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "first_name, last_name, town, age"
9. **Compare Datasets** `compareDatasets` — options: "[object Object]", resolve: "preferInput1", mergeByFields: "[object Object]"
10. **Insert Rows** `postgres` — table: `[object Object]`
11. **Update Rows** `postgres` — operation: **update**, table: `[object Object]`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow synchronizes data between Google Sheets and a Postgres database. It periodically retrieves data from both sources, compares them, and updates the Postgres database by inserting new rows or updating existing ones. The workflow ensures that the database is always in sync with the latest data from the Google Sheets.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner might use this workflow to ensure their sales data in Google Sheets is always reflected in their Postgres database, providing up-to-date information for analytics and reporting.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Postgres credentials.
3. Set the schedule trigger to your preferred interval (e.g., hourly).
4. Customize the Google Sheet and Postgres table details according to your data structure.
5. Run the workflow to test data synchronization.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Google Sheet and Postgres table with sample data. Run the workflow and observe how changes in the Google Sheet are reflected in the Postgres table. Modify some data in the Google Sheet and rerun the workflow to see the updates.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer data integration services, ensuring businesses have consistent and accurate data across platforms. This skill can help you attract clients looking to streamline their data operations, leading to new business opportunities and increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
