# Splitout Code Update Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, set×3, n8n×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "433.34242668485376", height: "205.3908222102156", content: "Check information for all workflows or a single workflow, activate corresponding node"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "228.883554909967", height: "240.99660770750089", content: "Set your instance URL here, it should not include API and version"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "192.26610453220889", height: "238.64272871402878", content: "Get n8n API key in settings > n8n API"
6. **instance base url** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
7. **get node types** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.instanceBaseUrl }}/types/nodes.json`
8. **extract name and latest version** `code` — jsCode: "// Loop over input items and add a new field called 'myNewField' to the JSON of each one
for (const item of $input.all()) {
  item.json.myNewField = 1;
}

return $input.all().map((…[truncated]"
9. **Aggregate** `aggregate` — options: "[object Object]", aggregate: "aggregateAllItemData"
10. **get all workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
11. **get single workflow** `n8n` — operation: **get**
12. **Split Out** `splitOut` — include: "selectedOtherFields", options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "nodes"
13. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **node names that needs update** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Summarize** `summarize` — options: "[object Object]", fieldsToSplitBy: "workflowName, workflowId", fieldsToSummarize: "[object Object]"
16. **prettify output** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks your n8n instance for workflows that contain nodes needing updates. It retrieves all node types and versions from your n8n instance, compares them against the nodes within each workflow, and identifies any nodes that are outdated. This ensures your workflows are using the latest node versions, which can help maintain functionality and security.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing multiple automation workflows could use this to routinely check for node updates, ensuring all workflows are up-to-date without manually inspecting each one. This can prevent potential issues due to outdated nodes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set your instance URL and obtain your n8n API key.
3. Run the workflow manually using the 'Test workflow' trigger.
4. Review the output to see which nodes require updates.
5. Update any outdated nodes within your workflows.

### Practice
Create a test workflow with an outdated node version. Run the main workflow to identify the outdated node. Observe how the workflow lists nodes that need updates, then update the node version and re-run the workflow to see the updated results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you ensure all your workflows are current, reducing the risk of errors and improving reliability. For a consultant, offering routine maintenance checks as a service can attract clients looking to keep their automation systems healthy, thereby increasing your revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
