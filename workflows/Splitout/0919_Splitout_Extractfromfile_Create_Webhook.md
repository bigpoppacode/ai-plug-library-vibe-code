## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On form submission**.
2. **On form submission** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Style Copy with Imagen 3.0", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "760", height: "640"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "720", height: "440"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "720", height: "440"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "980", height: "600"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "400", height: "1140", content: "## Try It Out!
### This n8n template allows you to use AI to generate logos or images which mimic visual styles of other logos or images. The model used to generate the images is G…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow allows users to create images that mimic the visual style of other images using Google's Imagen 3.0 AI model. Users submit a form with a source image URL and a prompt for the desired output. The workflow processes the input, generates styled images, and uploads them to Cloudinary. If an email is provided, results are sent to the user.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to quickly generate variations of a client's logo in different styles for branding projects. This saves time and provides creative options without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google and Cloudinary credentials.
3. Customize the form fields to match your needs.
4. Test by submitting a form with a source image URL and target prompt.
5. Verify the output in Cloudinary and check for email delivery if provided.

### Practice
Create a form with a few test images and prompts. Run the workflow to see how it generates styled images. Adjust the number of samples to see the effect on output and test different source images to explore style variations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated design services, enhancing creativity and efficiency. By providing unique styled image generation, you can attract clients and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googlePalmApi, httpQueryAuth, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
