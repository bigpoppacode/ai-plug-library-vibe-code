# Splitout Schedule Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Daily Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "288", height: "300", content: "Change **url** for Github Repo here"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "288", height: "300", content: "Change **to Email** here"
5. **Fetch Github Repo Releases** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.github.com/repos/n8n-io/n8n/releases/latest`
6. **If new release in the last day** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Split Out Content** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "body"
8. **Convert Markdown to HTML** `markdown` — mode: "markdownToHtml", options: "[object Object]", markdown: "={{ $json.body }}"
9. **Send Email** `emailSend` — html: "={{ $json.html }}", options: "[object Object]", subject: "New n8n release"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to check for the latest release of the n8n GitHub repository daily. It fetches the latest release data from GitHub, checks if the release was published within the last day, and if so, converts the release notes from Markdown to HTML format. Finally, it sends an email notification with the release details to a specified email address.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to stay updated on new releases of tools they rely on, like n8n. By automating release notifications, they ensure they always have the latest updates without manually checking GitHub.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Change the GitHub repo URL in the `Fetch Github Repo Releases` node.
3. Update the recipient email in the `Send Email` node.
4. Set up your SMTP credentials for sending emails.
5. Activate the workflow to run daily.

### Practice
Create a test email account and use it to receive notifications. Modify the workflow to check another GitHub repository to practice adapting the workflow to different needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated monitoring services to clients, ensuring they stay updated with the latest software releases. This enhances your service offerings and can lead to new business opportunities in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** smtp.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
