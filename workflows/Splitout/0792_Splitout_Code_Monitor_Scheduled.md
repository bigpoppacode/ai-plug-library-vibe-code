# Splitout Code Monitor Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "232", height: "346", content: "## Edit this node 👇

Get your store URL and replace in the GET url: https://{your-store}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2025-01/orders.json
"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "252", height: "346", content: "## Clone this spreadsheet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KRl6aCCU2SE3Z6vB2EbTnSwSUAre0BLf9Wu6fyPlrIE/edit?usp=sharing"
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching orders from a Shopify store and logging them into a Google Sheets document. It uses a manual trigger or schedule trigger to initiate the workflow, retrieves orders via a Shopify API call, checks for pagination, and iteratively collects all orders. The collected data is then formatted and appended to a specified Google Sheets document.
  
- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automatically log all their Shopify orders into a Google Sheets document for easy tracking and analysis, ensuring they have up-to-date sales data for inventory and financial planning.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Replace the Shopify API URL with your store's URL.
  3. Connect your Shopify and Google Sheets accounts.
  4. Configure the Google Sheets node with your document ID and sheet name.
  5. Activate the schedule trigger to automate data fetching.

- **Practice:** Create a test Google Sheet and run the workflow manually using the manual trigger. Check if the orders are correctly fetched and appended to your Google Sheet. Test with different Shopify stores by changing the API URL.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer order data automation services to e-commerce businesses, helping them streamline their operations and improve decision-making. This can attract more clients and increase your revenue in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** shopifyAccessTokenApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
