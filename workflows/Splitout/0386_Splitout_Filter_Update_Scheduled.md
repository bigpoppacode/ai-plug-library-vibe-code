# Splitout Filter Update Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using set×2, splitOut, filter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1120.1887804878038", height: "353.65439024390236"
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Edit Fields** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
5. **TronScan API** `httpRequest` — url: `https://apilist.tronscanapi.com/api/filter/trc20/transfers`
6. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "[redacted]"
7. **Filter** `filter` — conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Final Results** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", include: "none", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Aggregate** `aggregate` — options: "[object Object]", aggregate: "aggregateAllItemData", destinationFieldName: "Transactions"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow tracks USDT transactions for a specified TRC20 wallet. It periodically checks the TronScan API for recent transactions related to your wallet, filters them to find transactions received in the last 15 minutes, formats the results, and aggregates them into a list for further analysis or reporting.

### Demonstrate
A cryptocurrency investor can use this workflow to monitor incoming USDT transactions to their wallet in real-time, ensuring they are promptly informed of any new deposits without manually checking the wallet status.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Replace the placeholder in the "Edit Fields" node with your TRC20 wallet address.
3. Set the schedule trigger to your preferred interval.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly identifies and aggregates transactions.

### Practice
Create a mock TRC20 wallet transaction scenario and run the workflow. Observe how it filters and aggregates transactions, then modify the filter conditions to explore different scenarios, such as monitoring outgoing transactions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time cryptocurrency transaction monitoring services to clients, enhancing their financial tracking capabilities. This can attract more customers and generate additional income by providing tailored automation solutions in the crypto space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
