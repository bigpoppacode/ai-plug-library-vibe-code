# Splitout Code Monitor Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "232", height: "346", content: "## Edit this node 👇

Get your store URL and replace in the GET url: https://{your-store}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2025-01/customers.json
"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "272", height: "506", content: "## Clone this spreadsheet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8i98hwiFW7XG9HuxIZrOWfuLxGFaDm3EOAGQBZjhfk/edit?usp=sharing

Your spreadsheet can have up to three columns, and …[truncated]"
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of customer data from a Shopify store and populates it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. It retrieves customer information via Shopify's API, handles pagination to ensure all data is captured, and then formats and uploads the data to a designated Google Sheet. This process ensures a centralized and updated record of customer data for further analysis or integration with other business processes.

### Demonstrate
A Shopify store owner might use this workflow to automate the reporting of customer data for marketing analysis. By keeping an updated customer list in Google Sheets, they can easily track customer trends and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Replace the placeholder URL with your Shopify store URL in the HTTP Request node.
3. Connect your Google Sheets account and specify the sheet where data should be stored.
4. Set the schedule trigger to run at desired intervals.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is correctly pulled and stored.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet and use this workflow to pull and store a small sample of customer data from your Shopify store. Adjust the workflow to add additional data fields or modify the schedule as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data management solutions to e-commerce businesses, streamlining their operations and enhancing data-driven decision-making. This capability can attract clients seeking to leverage their customer data effectively, increasing your potential for generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** shopifyAccessTokenApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
