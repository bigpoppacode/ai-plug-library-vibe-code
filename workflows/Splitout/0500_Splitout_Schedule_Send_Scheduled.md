# Splitout Schedule Send Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Daily Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "288", height: "300", content: "Change **url** for Github Repo here"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "288", height: "300", content: "Change **to Email** here"
5. **Fetch Github Repo Releases** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.github.com/repos/n8n-io/n8n/releases/latest`
6. **Split Out Content** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "body"
7. **Convert Markdown to HTML** `markdown` — mode: "markdownToHtml", options: "[object Object]", markdown: "={{ $json.body }}"
8. **Send Gmail** `gmail` — sendTo: "nico@n8n.io", message: "={{ $json.html }}", options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking for the latest release of the n8n GitHub repository daily. It fetches the latest release data, extracts the content, converts it from markdown to HTML, and sends an email notification with the release details. This ensures you stay updated with the latest n8n releases without manual checking.

### Demonstrate
A developer can use this workflow to automatically receive notifications about new software releases from a GitHub repository they are interested in, saving time and ensuring they have the latest updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail account for email notifications.
3. Customize the GitHub URL to your repository of interest.
4. Set the recipient email address for notifications.
5. Activate the workflow to run daily.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that fetches the latest release from a different GitHub repository. Modify the email content to include specific release data like version number or release notes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you offer automated update notifications to clients, adding value to your service offerings. It can lead to increased efficiency, better client engagement, and potential upsells in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
