# Splitout Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

8. **Query BatchData Properties** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.batchdata.com/api/v1/properties/search`
9. **Get Previous Results** `code` — jsCode: "// Get the stored data from previous runs
const workflowStaticData = getWorkflowStaticData('global');

11. **Split Properties** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "allChanges"
12. **Filter High Potential** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **Get Property Details** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.batchdata.com/api/v1/properties/{{ $json.id }}`
14. **Format Email Content** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This workflow automates the scanning and analysis of real estate market data. It schedules regular checks for new or updated properties, filters for high-potential leads based on criteria like equity and owner status, retrieves detailed property information, and notifies the sales team via email and Slack about promising opportunities.

- **Demonstrate:** A real estate agency could use this workflow to consistently find and act on high-potential property leads, ensuring they are first to contact potential sellers and maximize their sales opportunities.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Add your BatchData API Key and configure email/Slack credentials.
  3. Set search parameters in the BatchData API Configuration node.
  4. Test with sample data to ensure property details and notifications are correct.

- **Practice:** Create a small dataset of properties and run the workflow to see how it identifies high-potential leads and sends notifications. Adjust criteria to see different results.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated lead generation services to real estate clients, enhancing their ability to quickly act on new opportunities. This can increase your service offerings and revenue potential in the real estate automation niche.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
