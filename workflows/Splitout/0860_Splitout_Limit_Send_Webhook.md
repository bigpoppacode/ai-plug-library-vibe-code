# Splitout Limit Send Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This workflow automates the process of scraping the latest essays from Paul Graham's website, extracting their content, and storing it in a Milvus vector database. It allows for the retrieval of relevant essays based on user queries using a vector store retriever and an AI model to generate answers from the stored data.

**Demonstrate:** A developer could use this workflow to build a knowledge base of essays for a company, allowing employees to quickly retrieve insights or summaries when needed, thus enhancing productivity and decision-making.

**Imitate:** 
1. Set up a Milvus server and create a collection.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Configure the HTTP Request nodes to fetch essays.
4. Connect to OpenAI and Milvus accounts.
5. Test the workflow by executing it to ensure essays are stored and retrievable.

**Practice:** Create a small test scenario by adding a few essays manually to a collection. Use the workflow to query these essays and verify the output to ensure the workflow retrieves and processes the data correctly.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can enable you to offer advanced data retrieval and AI-powered search services, attracting clients in need of building intelligent knowledge bases, thus expanding your service offerings and increasing revenue potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
