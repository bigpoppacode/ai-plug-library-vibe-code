# Error Twilio Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using errorTrigger, twilio.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Twilio**.
  2. **Twilio** `twilio` — to: "", from: "", message: "=Your workflow with ID: {{$node["Error Trigger"].json["workflow"]["id"]}} and name: {{$node["Error Trigger"].json["workflow"]["name"]}} failed to execute."
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to alert you via SMS whenever a workflow experiences a failure. It uses an "Error Trigger" node to detect when any workflow does not execute successfully. Once a failure is detected, the workflow sends an SMS through Twilio, detailing the workflow ID and name that failed.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure they are immediately informed of any automation failures, allowing them to quickly address issues in critical business processes, such as order processing or customer notifications.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Twilio with your phone number and credentials.
3. Define the "to" and "from" fields in the Twilio node.
4. Activate the workflow.
5. Test by intentionally causing a workflow error.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that intentionally fails (e.g., an API call to a non-existent endpoint) to test the error notification system. Observe how the Twilio node sends an SMS with the error details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide robust automation services by ensuring clients are promptly notified of any issues. This reliability can enhance client trust, leading to higher retention rates and potential upsells, boosting your automation business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** twilioApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
