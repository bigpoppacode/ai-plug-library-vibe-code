# Error Mondaycom Update Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using mondayCom×2, dateTime, errorTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Error Trigger**.
  2. **Error Trigger** `errorTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Monday** `mondayCom` — resource: **boardItem**
4. **Date & Time** `dateTime` — options: "[object Object]"
5. **Code** `code` — jsCode: "
console.log($('Error Trigger').last().json.execution)
str = escape ($('Error Trigger').last().json.execution.error.stack )
return { "stack": str}"
6. **UPDATE** `mondayCom` — resource: **boardItem**, operation: **changeMultipleColumnValues**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates error handling by capturing errors from other workflows and logging them into a Monday.com board. It starts with an "Error Trigger" that detects workflow errors. The error details, including the error message, stack trace, and associated workflow name, are then formatted and updated into a Monday.com board item. This ensures that all errors are documented in an organized manner for further review and action.

### Demonstrate
A developer team could use this workflow to monitor errors in their automated processes. By logging errors to a Monday.com board, they can easily track issues, assign them for resolution, and maintain a history for future reference.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Monday.com account credentials.
3. Set up other workflows with an "Error Trigger" for automatic error detection.
4. Customize the Monday.com board and columns to match your error logging needs.
5. Test the workflow by intentionally causing an error in another workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that fails, such as a webhook with incorrect URL handling. Trigger the error and observe how it gets logged into Monday.com. Modify the board item fields to include additional error details as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation services by providing robust error tracking and management. This capability can attract clients seeking reliable automation solutions, thus increasing client retention and enabling you to offer premium support services in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
