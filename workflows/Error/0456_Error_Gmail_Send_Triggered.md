# Error Gmail Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On Error**.
  2. **On Error** `errorTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "424.4907862645661", height: "154.7766688696994"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "241", height: "80", content: "### 👆🏽 Set target email here"
5. **Gmail** `gmail` — sendTo: "SET YOUR EMAIL HERE", message: "=⚠️ Workflow `{{$json["workflow"]["name"]}}` failed to run!
You can find the execution here: {{ $json.execution.url }}

error message from node {{ $json.execution.lastNodeExecuted …[truncated]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to notify a user via email whenever an error occurs in any other workflow. It uses an error trigger to detect workflow failures and then sends an email through Gmail with details about the error, including the workflow name, execution URL, and error message. This ensures that the user is immediately alerted to any issues that need attention.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to monitor critical automations, ensuring they are notified instantly if something goes wrong, allowing them to address issues promptly to minimize downtime or data loss.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n. Set up your Gmail credentials and update the "sendTo" field with your target email. Add this workflow as an error handler to other workflows by following n8n's error workflow setup instructions.

- **Practice:** Create a test workflow that deliberately fails (e.g., by using a non-existent API endpoint). Ensure the error workflow is set to trigger on failure, then observe if it sends an error notification to your email.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer reliable automation services by ensuring your clients' workflows are monitored for failures. This can improve client satisfaction, reduce troubleshooting time, and enhance your reputation for delivering robust, dependable automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
