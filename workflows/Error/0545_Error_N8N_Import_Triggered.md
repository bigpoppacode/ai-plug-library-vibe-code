# Error N8n Import Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using errorTrigger, code, n8n.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Error Trigger**.
  2. **Error Trigger** `errorTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Get execution data** `n8n` — resource: **execution**, operation: **get**
4. **Extract webhook data** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "const webhook_node_names = $json.workflowData.nodes.filter(x => x.type == 'n8n-nodes-base.webhook').map(x => x.name)

const webhook_data_array = webhook_node_names.map(n => $json.d…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle errors in other workflows. It triggers when an error occurs, retrieves the execution data of the failed workflow, and extracts relevant information about any webhook nodes involved. This helps in diagnosing and understanding the cause of the error.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to automatically log errors from their n8n automations, ensuring they can quickly identify and resolve issues, maintaining smooth operation of their automated processes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Ensure your n8n account credentials are set up.
3. Set a workflow to trigger an error.
4. Observe how this workflow captures and processes the error data.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that intentionally triggers an error, such as by using an incorrect API call. Run this workflow and watch how the error handling workflow captures and logs the error data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide reliable automation services by ensuring quick error detection and resolution, increasing client trust and allowing you to offer robust support packages, enhancing customer satisfaction and potentially increasing your revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
