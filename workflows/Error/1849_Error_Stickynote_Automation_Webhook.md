# Error Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote√ó3, errorTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Error Trigger**.
  2. **Error Trigger** `errorTrigger` ‚Äî configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "660", content: "## Error Handling

You can set this workflow as error workflow

https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/error-handling/#create-and-set-an-error-workflow"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "5", height: "300", content: "## Error Trigger

This flow will get trigger when the error occur. You can set only one error flow for all your flows.
"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "4", width: "320", height: "300"
6. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` ‚Äî method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push`
  
  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to notify you via a Line message whenever an error occurs in any of your workflows. It uses an "Error Trigger" node to detect errors, and an "HTTP Request" node to send a notification through the Line messaging API. This ensures you're immediately aware of any issues, allowing for quick troubleshooting and resolution.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing multiple n8n workflows might use this to stay informed about any failures in their automation processes, ensuring they can address issues quickly and maintain system reliability.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the Error Trigger node for your workflows.
3. Configure the HTTP Request node with your Line API credentials and replace `<UID HERE>` with your Line UID.
4. Test by intentionally causing an error in one of your workflows.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that intentionally fails (e.g., incorrect API endpoint). Ensure your error notification workflow correctly sends a Line message, confirming the setup works as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation reliability, building trust with clients by ensuring quick response to errors. This capability can be marketed as a premium service, increasing your offerings and potential income in an AI automation business.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
