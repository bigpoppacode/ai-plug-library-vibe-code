# Error Code Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Error Trigger**.
  2. **Error Trigger** `errorTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "483.4744075807993", height: "308.64949804469416", content: "## Default Error Handler

Update this to your preferred notification mechanism"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "232.91556831986873", height: "216.67545344104974", content: "get ID of self"
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "214.6984582852457", height: "219.7116384468202", content: "Runs every day at midnight to update new workflows"
7. **Gmail** `gmail` — sendTo: "=(your email address)", message: "={{ $json.execution.url }}", options: "[object Object]"
8. **get error handler** `n8n` — operation: **get**
9. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
10. **active && no error handler set && not this  handler workflow** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **set fields** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "const data = $json

data.settings.errorWorkflow = $('get error handler').item.json.id ;
delete data.settings.callerPolicy;

return {
  id: data.id,
  name: data.name,
  nodes: data…[truncated]"
12. **n8n | update** `n8n` — operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automatically assign an error handling workflow to other workflows that do not have one set up. It runs daily to check all active workflows and assigns a default error handler if they lack one. The error handler sends an email notification when a workflow fails, ensuring that issues are promptly addressed.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing multiple automated workflows might use this setup to ensure that any errors in their automation processes are caught and reported via email, allowing for quick troubleshooting and minimizing downtime.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your email credentials in the Gmail node.
3. Schedule the workflow to run daily using the Schedule Trigger.
4. Customize the email notification settings to fit your requirements.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it assigns error handlers correctly.

### Practice
Create a test workflow without an error handler. Run the main workflow and check if it assigns the default error handler to your test workflow. Verify that you receive an email notification if the test workflow fails.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow ensures your automation business maintains high reliability and customer satisfaction. By promptly addressing workflow errors, you enhance service quality, which can lead to increased client trust and potential upsell opportunities in your automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
