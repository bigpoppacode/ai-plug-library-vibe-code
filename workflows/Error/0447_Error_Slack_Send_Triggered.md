# Error Slack Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On Error**.
  2. **On Error** `errorTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "424.4907862645661", height: "154.7766688696994"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "241", height: "80", content: "### 👆🏽 Adjust error message here"
5. **Set message** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
6. **Slack** `slack` — text: "={{ $json.message }}", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to notify a Slack channel whenever an error occurs in any other workflow. It captures error details, formats them into a message, and sends this alert to a specified Slack channel. This helps maintain awareness of workflow failures, allowing for prompt troubleshooting.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure they are immediately informed of any automation failures in their business processes, allowing them to quickly address issues and minimize downtime.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure Slack credentials in the Slack node.
3. Connect this error workflow to other workflows by setting it as the error workflow.
4. Adjust the error message content to fit your needs.
5. Activate the workflow and test it by causing a deliberate error in another workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that deliberately fails (e.g., by calling a non-existent API) to trigger the error workflow. Observe the error message sent to Slack and experiment with customizing the message format or details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this error notification workflow ensures you maintain high reliability in your automation services, enhancing client trust and satisfaction. This capability can lead to increased client retention and the opportunity to offer premium monitoring services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
