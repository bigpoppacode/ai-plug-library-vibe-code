# Error Mailgun Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using errorTrigger, mailgun.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Mailgun** `mailgun` — text: "=Error: {{$node["Error Trigger"].data["execution"]["error"]["message"]}}

Stack Trace:
{{$node["Error Trigger"].data["execution"]["error"]["stack"]}}", subject: "=Workflow Error:  {{$node["Error Trigger"].data["workflow"]["name"]}}", toEmail: ""
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle errors in other workflows by sending an email notification using Mailgun. When a workflow error occurs, the Error Trigger node captures the error details, including the error message and stack trace. These details are then sent via email to a specified address, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to monitor their automation workflows. If an error occurs, they receive an immediate email notification with error details, allowing them to quickly address the issue and maintain workflow reliability.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Mailgun account and configure the email settings.
3. Set the recipient email address for error notifications.
4. Activate the workflow so it listens for errors.
5. Test by intentionally causing an error in another workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that triggers an error (e.g., a failed HTTP request). Ensure your error handling workflow sends an email notification with the error details. Adjust the settings to refine the information you receive.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow ensures you can maintain high reliability in your automation services. Quick error notifications allow for faster troubleshooting, enhancing client trust and satisfaction, and potentially increasing your value as a service provider.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mailgunApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
