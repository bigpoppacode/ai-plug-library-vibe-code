# Error Postgres Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Error Trigger**.
  2. **Error Trigger** `errorTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "820", height: "1140"
4. **Sometimes... just cleanup** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
5. **Call this Sample - Prepend to your error catcher** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]"
6. **See below to prepend this at your error handling** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "840", height: "460", content: "# Error handling sample
"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1140", height: "340", content: "# Database Cleanup: Useful in DEV, but DO NOT run in production"
9. **Truncate Log Database** `postgres` — operation: **deleteTable**, table: `[object Object]`
10. **Principal E-Mail** `emailSend` — text: "={{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.url }}

{{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.lastNodeExecuted }}

{{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.error.message }}
{{ $("E…[truncated]", options: "[object Object]", subject: "=Erro -  {{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.workflow.name }}"
11. **Push mobile notification** `pushover` — message: "={{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.workflow.name }} - {{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.url }}

{{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.lastNodeExecuted }}

{{ $("Error Tri…[truncated]", userKey: "=u4RMqXQR9EFdeSQBfaL1riBy1Qd953", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
12. **Insert Log** `postgres` — table: `[object Object]`
13. **Count for 5 minutes** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
14. **Fallback E-Mail** `emailSend` — text: "={{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.url }}

{{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.lastNodeExecuted }}

{{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.execution.error.message }}
{{ $("E…[truncated]", options: "[object Object]", subject: "=Erro -  {{ $("Error Trigger").item.json.workflow.name }}"
15. **If there is no logs in 5 minutes** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]", looseTypeValidation: "true"
16. **Insert your error handling logic after this** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
17. **CleanUp execution. See below if you will prepend this workflow** `code` — jsCode: "return [];"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle error logging and notifications efficiently. It triggers on errors, logs the error details to a database, and checks if similar errors have occurred in the last five minutes. If not, it sends an email and a mobile notification about the error. This prevents sending too many notifications for the same issue while ensuring error logs are maintained for review and troubleshooting.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to monitor their application for errors. If an error arises, the workflow logs it and alerts the team, allowing them to address issues proactively and reducing the risk of system failures.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your database and email services.
3. Set up error triggers in your applications.
4. Customize email and notification settings.
5. Test by simulating an error and verifying logs and alerts.

### Practice
Create a test environment and induce an error in your application. Run the workflow to check if it logs the error and sends notifications correctly. Adjust the workflow to fit different error types or notification preferences.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer robust error monitoring services, enhancing application reliability. By preventing notification overload and ensuring timely alerts, you can help businesses maintain system uptime and improve customer satisfaction, thus generating income through service offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres, smtp, pushoverApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
