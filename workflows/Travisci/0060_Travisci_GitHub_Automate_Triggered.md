# TravisCI Github Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using githubTrigger, if, travisCi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **NoOp**.
2. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow listens for events from a GitHub repository, specifically `push` or `pull_request` events. When one of these events occurs, it checks the event type. If the event is a `push`, it triggers a build in Travis CI. If the event is a `pull_request`, it performs no operation, as indicated by the NoOp node.

### Demonstrate
A software development team might use this workflow to automatically trigger builds in Travis CI whenever code is pushed to their GitHub repository, ensuring continuous integration and testing.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub and Travis CI accounts.
3. Configure the GitHub trigger with your repository details.
4. Adjust the conditions in the IF node if needed.
5. Test the workflow by pushing code to your GitHub repo.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository and connect it to Travis CI. Use the workflow to trigger a Travis CI build when code is pushed. Observe the workflow's behavior when a pull request is opened to ensure it does nothing.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer continuous integration services, improving software quality and delivery speed. This can attract clients seeking efficient development processes, boosting your business as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** githubOAuth2Api, travisCiApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
