  Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, noOp, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Submit form**.
  2. **Submit form** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Join my mailing list now", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "505", height: "180", content: "## Automate Email List Building with n8n and Hunter io

💡 Read the [case study here](https://rumjahn.com/create-email-capture-forms-for-free-using-n8n-and-sendgrid-and-easily-grow…[truncated]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", height: "320", content: "## Hunter io

You need to get a Hunter.io account and input the API key. There's 50 free credits per month."
5. **Verify email** `hunter` — operation: **emailVerifier**
6. **Check if the email is valid** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Add contact to list** `sendGrid` — resource: **contact**
8. **Email is not valid, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates email list management. When someone submits their email via a form, the workflow uses Hunter.io to verify if the email is valid. If valid, the email is added to a SendGrid contact list for marketing purposes. If not, no further action is taken.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their marketing emails reach only valid addresses, reducing bounce rates and improving email deliverability, ultimately enhancing marketing efforts.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect to Hunter.io and SendGrid by adding your API keys.  
3. Customize the form fields and SendGrid list ID to match your needs.  
4. Test the workflow by submitting an email through the form and check the results.

**Practice**  
Create a simple form with a few email addresses, including some invalid ones. Run the workflow and observe which emails are added to the SendGrid list. Modify the emails to see how the workflow handles different inputs.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your business by ensuring clean email lists, improving campaign effectiveness, and offering email validation as a service to clients, potentially increasing your revenue and client satisfaction.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** hunterApi, sendGridApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
