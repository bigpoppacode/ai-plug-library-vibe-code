# Mautic Slack Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Send to Slack**.
  2. **Send to Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `#mautic-alerts`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking new Mautic contact emails for validity. When a new contact is identified, it extracts the contact's email, verifies its validity using an email validation API, and checks for issues like poor deliverability, invalid domains, or disposable addresses. If any issues are found, it sends an alert to a designated Slack channel, ensuring that the team is aware of potentially problematic email addresses.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to maintain a clean email list. By identifying suspicious emails early, they can prevent sending campaigns to invalid or risky addresses, which helps maintain their sender reputation and improves marketing effectiveness.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Mautic and Slack accounts.
3. Customize the Slack channel and message content.
4. Set up a trigger to start the workflow when a new contact is identified.
5. Test with sample contacts to ensure alerts are sent for suspicious emails.

### Practice
Create a test Mautic instance and add several contacts with varying email qualities. Run the workflow and observe how it identifies and reports suspicious emails to your Slack channel. Adjust the workflow to refine which issues trigger alerts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing email validation as part of your automation solutions. This can help clients maintain high email deliverability rates, reducing costs and potentially increasing revenue from email marketing campaigns.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mauticOAuth2Api, oneSimpleApi, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
