  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of managing customer data between WooCommerce and Mautic. When a customer is created or updated in WooCommerce, the workflow checks if the customer already exists in Mautic. If the customer is new, it creates a new contact in Mautic. If the customer already exists, it updates their details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep their marketing database up-to-date with customer information from their online store, ensuring that marketing campaigns are targeted and relevant.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your WooCommerce and Mautic accounts.
3. Set up the WooCommerce trigger for customer updates.
4. Customize the Mautic nodes to match your contact fields.
5. Test the workflow by updating a customer in WooCommerce.

### Practice
Create a test customer in WooCommerce and update their information. Run the workflow to see if the customer is correctly created or updated in Mautic. Adjust the workflow as needed for different fields.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer seamless CRM integrations to clients, enhancing their marketing capabilities and customer relationship management. This can increase your service offerings and revenue potential in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
