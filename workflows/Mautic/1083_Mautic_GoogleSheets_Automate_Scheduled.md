  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data synchronization between Google Sheets and Mautic, a marketing automation platform. It runs every 5 minutes, fetching contact details like email, first name, and mobile from a Google Sheet, and updates or adds these contacts into Mautic for marketing campaigns or CRM purposes.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their latest customer data from Google Sheets is consistently updated in Mautic. This keeps marketing campaigns accurate and targeted, enhancing customer engagement and retention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Mautic accounts.
3. Set the Google Sheets range to match your data.
4. Ensure the Mautic fields align with your contact data.
5. Test the workflow to confirm data updates correctly every 5 minutes.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with dummy contact data. Run the workflow and verify that Mautic is updated with this data. Experiment by adding new contacts to see if they sync correctly on schedule.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated marketing data synchronization services to clients. This enhances their marketing efficiency, potentially increasing your income through service packages or retainers in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleApi, mauticApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
