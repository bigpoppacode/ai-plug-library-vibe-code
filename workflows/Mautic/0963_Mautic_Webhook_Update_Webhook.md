1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Mautic account using OAuth2 credentials.
3. Set up the webhook to receive user data.
4. Customize the nodes to fit your user data structure in Mautic.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates and manages user data as expected.

**Practice:** Create a test scenario where a user requests to unsubscribe from marketing emails. Run the workflow and verify that the user's status in Mautic is updated accordingly. Experiment with tagging users based on different criteria.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you efficiently manage user data and preferences, enhancing your service offerings.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
