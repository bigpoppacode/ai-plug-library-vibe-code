# Gmail Stickynote Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Gmail Trigger** `gmailTrigger` — simple: "false", filters: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
3. **JSON Parser** `outputParserStructured` — jsonSchema: "{
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "needsReply": {
 "type": "boolean"
 }
 },
 "required": ["needsReply"]
}
"
4. **OpenAI Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "304.10628068244364", height: "394.42512272977456", content: "## When I receive an Email
"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "556", height: "397", content: "## ... that Needs a Reply
"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "333.19082443588354", height: "400.08454375343996", content: "## Generate a Reply"
8. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "326", height: "395", content: "## ...as a Draft in the conversation"
9. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4-turbo`
10. **Assess if message needs a reply** `chainLlm` — prompt: "=Subject: {{ $json.subject }}
Message:
{{ $json.textAsHtml }} "
11. **If Needs Reply** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **Generate email reply** `chainLlm` — text: "=Subject: {{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.subject }}
Message: {{ $('Gmail Trigger').item.json.textAsHtml }}", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
13. **Gmail - Create Draft** `gmail` — resource: **draft**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling incoming emails. It triggers when a new email arrives in Gmail, uses AI to assess if the email requires a reply, and if it does, generates a draft response using OpenAI's language model. This draft is then saved in Gmail as a draft, ready for review or sending.

**Demonstrate**  
A consultant might use this workflow to manage their email inbox efficiently, ensuring that important emails are identified and responded to promptly, without manual oversight, thereby saving time and improving client communication.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Gmail and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set up the Gmail Trigger to monitor your inbox.
4. Customize the AI prompt to fit your email tone.
5. Test the workflow with incoming emails to ensure it drafts replies correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test Gmail account and send a few emails to it. Run the workflow to see how it assesses and drafts replies. Adjust AI prompts to better match your preferred style and test again for accuracy.

**WIIFM**  
This workflow can streamline your email management, allowing you to offer email automation services to clients. By mastering this, you can enhance client communication efficiency, potentially increasing client satisfaction and opening up new revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
