# Gmail Stickynote Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Received Emails with Sales Label** `gmailTrigger` — simple: "false", filters: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
3. **OpenAI Model** `lmOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "446.44549763033154", height: "261.8821936357484", content: "## Summarize emails and save them as notes on sales opportunity in Odoo

Set up steps:

5. **Summarize Email Content** `chainSummarization` — options: "[object Object]"
6. **Odoo - Create Opportunity** `odoo` — resource: **opportunity**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates the process of identifying and summarizing sales-related emails in Gmail and creating sales opportunities in Odoo. It starts by detecting emails labeled as "Sales," uses OpenAI to generate a concise summary of the email content, and then saves this summary in Odoo as a sales opportunity, ensuring no potential leads are missed.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this to automatically process inquiries from potential clients, ensuring that each inquiry is efficiently recorded and followed up on, thereby improving sales efficiency and reducing the risk of losing leads.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n setup.  
2. Connect your Gmail and Odoo accounts.  
3. Set up a Gmail label for sales emails.  
4. Configure OpenAI credentials.  
5. Test the workflow by sending a sales inquiry email to your Gmail.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Gmail account and label some emails as "Sales." Run the workflow to see how it processes these emails into Odoo opportunities. Adjust the OpenAI prompts to better extract relevant information.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated lead management solutions to businesses, enhancing their sales processes. This can increase your value as a consultant, allowing you to attract more clients and generate income by offering automated solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, odooApi, openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
