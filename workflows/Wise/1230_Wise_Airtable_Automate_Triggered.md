# Wise Airtable Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Airtable**.
2. **Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **append**, table: `Table 1`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of tracking money transfers using Wise. It starts with a Wise Trigger that detects changes in transfer status, retrieves the transfer details, formats the data, and appends it to an Airtable database. This ensures that every transfer is logged with key details like Transfer ID, Date, Reference, and Amount.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically log all financial transactions in Airtable. This helps keep an organized record of all transfers, simplifying financial tracking and reporting without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Wise and Airtable credentials.
3. Configure the Wise Trigger for your profile ID.
4. Map the transfer details in the Set node.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is correctly logged in Airtable.

### Practice
Create a test transfer in Wise and run the workflow. Check Airtable to see if the transfer details are logged accurately. Modify the data fields in the Set node to experiment with logging additional details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated financial tracking services to clients, improving their financial management. This adds value to your automation business, leading to potential upsells and increased client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** wiseApi, airtableApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
