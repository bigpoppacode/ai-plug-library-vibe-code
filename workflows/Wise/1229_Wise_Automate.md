# Wise Automate
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using wise×4.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Wise3**.
2. **Wise3** `wise` — resource: **transfer**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of transferring money using the Wise API. It first creates a quote for a currency transfer, then initiates and executes the transfer based on this quote. The workflow is designed to handle currency transfers seamlessly, ensuring that funds are moved accurately between accounts.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate regular payments to international suppliers, ensuring timely and consistent transfers without manual intervention, thus saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Wise API credentials.
3. Modify the amount, currencies, and account details as needed.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it properly creates, initiates, and executes transfers.

### Practice
Create a test Wise account and use small test amounts to run the workflow. Monitor the steps to see how each node processes information and ensure the transfer is executed correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated financial transaction services to clients, enhancing efficiency and reliability in their payment processes. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and open up new revenue streams in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** wiseApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
