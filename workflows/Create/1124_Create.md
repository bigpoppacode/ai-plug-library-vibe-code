# Create
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Create JSON-items**.
  2. **Create JSON-items** `function` — functionCode: "return items[0].json.map(item => { 
  return {
    json: item,
  }
})
"

  ### Explain
This n8n workflow takes a list of mock data items and processes each item to create individual JSON objects. It starts with a node generating mock data, which consists of a list of objects with ID and name attributes. The workflow then maps each object to a new JSON structure, allowing further processing or integration with other systems or services.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to transform a batch of user data into a format suitable for integration with an external API, ensuring each user record is processed individually and can be sent to the API in the correct format.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Add a "Mock Data" node to generate sample data.
3. Connect a "Create JSON-items" node to transform each data entry.
4. Test the workflow to ensure each data item is converted into a separate JSON object.
5. Customize the mock data or JSON transformation logic as needed.

### Practice
Create a simple mock data set with different fields, such as email or address, and run the workflow. Observe how each entry is processed into a JSON object. Modify the transformation logic to include additional fields or customize the output format.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you efficiently manage and transform data, a crucial skill in automation. It enables you to offer tailored data processing solutions to clients, enhancing your service offerings and potentially increasing your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
