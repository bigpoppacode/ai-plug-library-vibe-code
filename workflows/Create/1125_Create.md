# Create
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Create an array of objects**.
  2. **Create an array of objects** `function` — functionCode: "return [
  {
    json: {
      data_object: items.map(item => item.json),
    },
  }
];
"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow takes a set of mock data and transforms it into a structured array of objects. Initially, it creates mock data with several entries, each having an ID and a name. The workflow then processes this data to combine it into a single object containing an array of these entries, making it easier to manage and utilize in subsequent steps or integrations.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to prepare data for further processing, such as sending it to an API or storing it in a database. It's particularly useful when needing to consolidate individual pieces of data into a single, structured format.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Review the mock data in the first function node to understand its structure.
3. Adjust the mock data as needed to match your use case.
4. Execute the workflow to see how the data is transformed into an array of objects.

### Practice
Create your own mock data with different fields (e.g., email, age) and modify the function to include these fields in the array of objects. Run the workflow to ensure it correctly outputs the new structure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to efficiently manipulate and prepare data for various applications, enhancing your ability to create robust automation solutions for clients. This skill can increase your service offerings, attract more clients, and boost your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
