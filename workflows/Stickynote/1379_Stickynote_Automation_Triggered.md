# Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, chatTrigger, lmChatOllama.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Ollama Chat Model** `lmChatOllama` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "485", height: "473", content: "## Chat with local LLMs using n8n and Ollama
This n8n workflow allows you to seamlessly interact with your self-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) through a user-friendly chat int…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "368", height: "258"
6. **Chat LLM Chain** `chainLlm` — configured for its default action.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow allows users to interact with self-hosted Large Language Models (LLMs) via n8n and Ollama. When a chat message is received, the workflow triggers the sending of this message to the Ollama server. Ollama processes the input using its LLMs and returns an AI-generated response, which is then sent back to the chat interface. Essentially, it creates a seamless chat experience with local LLMs using n8n.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to set up a local customer support chatbot that utilizes LLMs for generating responses, ensuring data privacy and control by keeping interactions within their local network.

### Imitate
1. Set up Ollama on your local machine.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Connect to your local Ollama instance (ensure network access if using Docker).
4. Customize the chat trigger to fit your application.
5. Test by sending a chat message to see the LLM-generated response.

### Practice
Create a test environment with a local setup of Ollama. Send various types of chat messages to the workflow and observe the responses. Adjust the LLM configurations to see how it affects the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer secure, customizable AI chat solutions to clients, enhancing their customer interactions while maintaining data privacy. This capability can expand your service offerings and potentially increase revenue in your automation business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
