# Stickynote Send Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **Basic SSH commands** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/linux-commands`
5. **Execute SSH** `toolWorkflow` — name: "SSH", source: "parameter", description: "Call this tool to execute the bash command on external VPS.
To pass a command to execute, you should only pass the command itself.
"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "260", content: "[redacted]"
7. **AI SysAdmin** `agent` — text: "=You are an AI Linux System Administrator Agent expert designed to help manage Linux VPS systems.
The user will communicate with you as a fellow colleague. You must understand thei…[truncated]", agent: "reActAgent", options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing Linux VPS systems through an AI-powered system administrator. When a chat message is received, the AI interprets the user's request, retrieves basic SSH commands, and then executes these commands on an external VPS using SSH. The AI ensures the user intent is understood and that only safe, non-destructive commands are executed, providing a seamless automation for VPS management.

### Demonstrate
A systems administrator could use this workflow to automate routine server management tasks, like checking server status or updating software, without manual SSH logins. This saves time, reduces errors, and enhances security.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI and SSH credentials.
3. Set up a chat trigger to receive messages.
4. Customize the AI SysAdmin agent text for specific server tasks.
5. Test with simple commands like "check disk space."

### Practice
Create a test VPS and use the workflow to execute non-destructive commands like listing directory contents. Modify commands to see how the AI interprets and executes them, ensuring safe operations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer VPS management services with AI automation, reducing manual workload and increasing efficiency. This can expand your service offerings and attract clients seeking innovative solutions in server management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, sshPassword.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
