# Stickynote GoogleDrive Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, vectorStorePinecone×2, embeddingsGoogleGemini×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Drive File Updated**.
2. **Embeddings Google Gemini** `embeddingsGoogleGemini` — modelName: "models/text-embedding-004"
3. **Default Data Loader** `documentDefaultDataLoader` — options: "[object Object]", dataType: "binary"
4. **Recursive Character Text Splitter** `textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` — options: "[object Object]", chunkOverlap: "100"
5. **Vector Store Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "company_documents_tool", description: "Retrieve information from any company documents"
6. **Pinecone Vector Store (Retrieval)** `vectorStorePinecone` — options: "[object Object]", pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
7. **Embeddings Google Gemini (retrieval)** `embeddingsGoogleGemini` — modelName: "models/text-embedding-004"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — content: "## Chat with company documents"
9. **Google Drive File Updated** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileUpdated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
10. **Google Drive File Created** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
11. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
13. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "320", content: "## Add docuemnts to vector store when updating or creating new documents in Google Drive"
14. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
15. **Google Gemini Chat Model (retrieval)** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
16. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "420", height: "720", content: "## Set up steps

1. Google Cloud Project and Vertex AI API:
* Create a Google Cloud project.
* Enable the Vertex AI API for your project.
2. Google AI API Key:
* Obtain a Google AI…[truncated]"
17. **Download File From Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
18. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
19. **Pinecone Vector Store** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the management of company documents stored in Google Drive. It monitors specific folders for newly created or updated files, downloads them, and processes these documents to create text embeddings using Google Gemini. The embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database. This setup allows users to query company documents efficiently by using a chat interface, which retrieves and presents relevant information based on the document embeddings.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to enhance their internal knowledge management system. Employees can quickly retrieve precise information from company documents, such as policies or project details, using a chat interface, improving efficiency and reducing time spent searching through files.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up Google Drive, Google Gemini, and Pinecone accounts.
3. Configure the Google Drive triggers to monitor specific folders.
4. Connect the nodes to process and store document embeddings in Pinecone.
5. Test the chat interface to ensure it retrieves information accurately.

### Practice
Create a test folder in Google Drive and add sample documents. Run the workflow to ensure documents are processed and stored in Pinecone. Use the chat interface to query specific topics within the documents and verify the accuracy of the information retrieved.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can significantly enhance your ability to offer document management and retrieval solutions to clients. It provides a scalable way to interact with large volumes of data, creating opportunities for consulting or developing AI-powered knowledge systems, thereby increasing your service offerings and potential income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** pineconeApi, googlePalmApi, googleDriveOAuth2Api.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
