# Stickynote Send Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, memoryBufferWindow, openAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "398", height: "217"
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — height: "300.48941882630095", content: "## Try me out
1. In the OpenAI Assistant node, make sure your OpenAI credentials are set and choose an assistant to use (you'll need to create one if you don't have one already)
2.…[truncated]"
4. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $('When chat message received').first().json.sessionId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey", contextWindowLength: "20"
5. **Calculator1** `toolCalculator` — configured for its default action.
6. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]"
7. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **assistant**, prompt: "define"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow facilitates a chat interaction where a user inputs messages that are sent to an OpenAI assistant for processing. The workflow remembers the session's context using a memory node, which allows the AI to provide coherent responses based on past interactions. The Calculator node is set up for default actions but is not directly connected to the main workflow path.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to set up a virtual assistant on their website, allowing customers to ask questions and receive instant responses, enhancing customer service without needing a live agent.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up OpenAI credentials in the OpenAI node.
3. Connect a chat interface to the "When chat message received" node.
4. Test the workflow by sending chat messages and observing the AI responses.
5. Adjust the memory settings to optimize context retention.

### Practice
Create a simple chat interface on a webpage that connects to this workflow. Experiment with different prompts and observe how the AI's responses change based on the session context maintained by the memory node.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer intelligent chat solutions to clients, enhancing their customer interaction capabilities. This can open up new revenue streams in customer support automation and AI-driven engagement strategies.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
