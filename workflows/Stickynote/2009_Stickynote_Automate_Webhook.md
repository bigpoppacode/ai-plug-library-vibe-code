# Stickynote Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note14** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "680", height: "700"
4. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
5. **gpt-4o-mini** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "400", height: "320", content: "## Jina.ai Web Scraper Tool
### No API Key Required
https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "460", height: "760"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "280", height: "320"
9. **Jina.ai Web Scraper Tool** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `=https://r.jina.ai/{url}`
10. **Jina.ai Web Scraping Agent** `agent` — text: "=You have access to a powerful scrape_website tool that can retrieve real-time web content. Use this tool to extract any needed information from the website, analyze the data, and …[truncated]", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow acts as an AI-powered chatbot that utilizes Jina.ai's web scraping tool to fetch real-time web content. When a chat message is received, the workflow triggers the Jina.ai Web Scraping Agent, which processes the user's query, scrapes the specified website for relevant data, and formulates a response using the gpt-4o-mini language model. The workflow also employs memory management to maintain context throughout interactions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support queries, providing users with up-to-date information directly from the company's website or documentation, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing manual support efforts.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Jina.ai and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set up a chat interface that triggers the workflow with user queries.
4. Ensure the Jina.ai Web Scraper Tool is configured to extract the URL from user prompts.
5. Test with sample queries to verify accurate data retrieval and response formulation.

### Practice
Create a test scenario where users inquire about specific product details. Use the workflow to scrape your product webpage and provide detailed responses. Adjust the workflow to handle different types of queries and observe how it maintains context and accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer advanced AI-driven customer support solutions, increasing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. This capability can attract more clients seeking innovative automation solutions, potentially boosting your income in the AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
