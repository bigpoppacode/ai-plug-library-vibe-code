# Stickynote Notion Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Drive Trigger**.
2. **Google Drive Trigger** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "459.0695038476583", height: "425.9351190986499", content: "## Trigger and Download of audio file

In this example I'm using Google Drive. 
As soon as a audio file is uploaded the trigger will start and download the audio file. "
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "516.8340993895782", height: "420.4856289531857"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "231.28081576725737", height: "411.7664447204431", content: "## Sending to Notion

We now send the summary to a new Notion page."
6. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
7. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **audio**, operation: **transcribe**
8. **OpenAI1** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
9. **Notion** `notion` — title: "={{ JSON.parse($json.message.content).audioContentSummary.title }} ", pageId: "[object Object]", blockUi: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This workflow automates the process of transcribing and summarizing audio files uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder. When a new audio file is added, it triggers a download of the file. The audio is then transcribed using OpenAI's transcription service. The transcription is further processed by OpenAI to generate a structured summary, which includes key points and sentiment analysis. Finally, this summary is sent to a new page in Notion for easy access and review.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automatically transcribe and summarize meeting recordings, ensuring that key points are documented and easily accessible in Notion for team members who couldn't attend.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n. Connect your Google Drive and Notion accounts. Set up the Google Drive Trigger to monitor a specific folder for new audio files. Ensure that OpenAI credentials are configured. Test the workflow by uploading an audio file to the designated folder and verify that the summary appears in Notion.

- **Practice:** Create a test folder in Google Drive, upload an audio recording, and run the workflow. Observe how the transcription and summary are generated and sent to Notion. Experiment by modifying the audio file to see how changes affect the summary.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer transcription and summarization services, enhancing productivity for clients by automating meeting documentation. This can lead to new business opportunities, higher efficiency, and increased revenue in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, notionApi, openAiApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
