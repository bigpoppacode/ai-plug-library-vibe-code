# Stickynote ExecuteWorkflow Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Workflow Input Trigger**.
2. **Marketplace Agent Brain** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **Marketplace Agent Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
4. **Workflow Input Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
5. **OpenSea Get All Listings by Collection** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/listings/collection/{collection_slug}/all`
6. **OpenSea Get All Offers by Collection** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/offers/collection/{collection_slug}/all`
7. **OpenSea Get Best Listing by NFT** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/listings/collection/{collection_slug}/nfts/{identifier}/best`
8. **OpenSea Get Best Listings by Collection** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/listings/collection/{collection_slug}/best`
9. **OpenSea Get Best Offer by NFT** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/offers/collection/{collection_slug}/nfts/{identifier}/best`
10. **OpenSea Get Collection Offers** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/offers/collection/{collection_slug}`
11. **OpenSea Get Item Offers** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/orders/{chain}/{protocol}/offers`
12. **OpenSea Get Listings** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/orders/{chain}/{protocol}/listings`
13. **OpenSea Get Trait Offers** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/offers/collection/{collection_slug}/traits`
14. **OpenSea Get Order** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/orders/chain/{chain}/protocol/0x0000000000000068f116a894984e2db1123eb395/{order_hash}`
15. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "1380", height: "1860"
16. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1500", height: "1080"
17. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "1060", height: "520"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to interact with the OpenSea API to gather and analyze data about NFTs. It retrieves various types of information from the OpenSea marketplace, such as all listings and offers for a specific collection, the best listings, and offers for individual NFTs, and order details using specific identifiers. This setup helps NFT traders and collectors make informed decisions by providing them with real-time data insights.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the process of tracking the best offers and listings for a collection of NFTs they're interested in, enabling them to make timely investment decisions and optimize their trading strategy.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your OpenSea API credentials.
3. Configure the workflow trigger based on your data needs (e.g., schedule or event-driven).
4. Customize the collection slugs and identifiers to match your interests.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it fetches and processes data correctly.

### Practice
Create a test scenario where you simulate fetching data for a specific NFT collection using the workflow. Observe how the workflow retrieves and processes the data, and experiment with different collection slugs and NFT identifiers to see the variations in output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to provide valuable NFT market insights to clients, positioning you as a knowledgeable consultant in the NFT space. This can lead to increased demand for your services and the potential to generate income by offering specialized NFT data analytics solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
