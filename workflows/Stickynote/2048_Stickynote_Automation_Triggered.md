# Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×8, set×3, chatTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Ollama Model** `lmOllama` — model: `llama3.2:latest`
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "520", height: "860"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "560", height: "200", content: "## Model Node
- Name: Ollama Model
- Type: LangChain Ollama Integration
- Model: llama3.2:latest
- Purpose: Provides the language model capabilities"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "280", height: "400"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "500", height: "620"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "420", height: "200"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "420", height: "520"
10. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "460", height: "420"
11. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "540", height: "560"
12. **Basic LLM Chain** `chainLlm` — text: "=Provide the users prompt and response as a JSON object with two fields:
- Prompt
- Response

Avoid any preample or further explanation.

This is the question: {{ $json.chatInput }…[truncated]", promptType: "define"
13. **JSON to Object** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Error Response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Structured Response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates chat message processing by receiving a message, analyzing it with a language model (Llama 3.2 via Ollama), and then returning a structured JSON response. If the processing fails, an error response is generated to ensure robust handling.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to automate customer support, where incoming chat messages are processed and responded to based on predefined criteria, saving time and ensuring consistent communication.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Ollama account with API credentials.
3. Set up a chat trigger for incoming messages.
4. Customize the processing logic in the LLM Chain node as needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it returns correct responses.

### Practice
Set up a simple chat interface and use the workflow to process different queries. Adjust the LLM Chain node to handle various types of messages and observe how the responses change based on your configurations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated chat solutions to businesses, enhancing customer service efficiency. This skill can attract clients seeking AI-driven communication tools, boosting your income and service portfolio in the AI automation industry.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
