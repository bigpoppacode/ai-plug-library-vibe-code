# Stickynote Notion Send Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **Search notion database** `toolHttpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/{{ $json.notionID }}/query`
4. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — contextWindowLength: "4"
5. **Search inside database record** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{page_id}/children`
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "462.3561535890252", height: "95.12709218477178"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "462.3561535890252", height: "172.4760209818479"
8. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "=Happy {{ $today.weekdayLong }}!
Knowledge source assistant at your service. How can I help you?"
9. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "463.90418399676537", height: "318.2958135288425"
10. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "461.5634274842711", height: "332.14098134070576"
11. **Get database details** `notion` — resource: **database**
12. **Format schema** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.chatInput }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow acts as a conversational assistant using OpenAI and Notion. It receives chat messages, retrieves relevant data from a Notion database, and uses AI to provide concise, accurate responses. The workflow ensures efficient information retrieval and user interaction by leveraging AI and structured data.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create a customer support chatbot that answers frequently asked questions by querying a Notion knowledge base, saving time and providing instant support.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Notion and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set up a chat trigger to receive messages.
4. Configure Notion database details and queries.
5. Test the workflow to ensure accurate responses.

### Practice
Create a Notion database with sample FAQs, then run the workflow. Ask the chat assistant questions and observe how it retrieves and responds with relevant data. Modify database entries to test response accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer AI-powered chat solutions to clients, enhancing customer service and engagement. This can generate income by providing scalable, efficient support systems for businesses, increasing client satisfaction and retention.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, notionApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
