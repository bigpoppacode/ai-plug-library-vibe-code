# Stickynote ExecuteWorkflow Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×7, executeWorkflowTrigger, chainLlm.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When Executed by Another Workflow**.
2. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "jsonExample", jsonExample: "{
  "name" : "Atlassian",
  "audience" : "api.atlassian.com"
}"
3. **Structured Output Parser** `outputParserStructured` — schemaType: "manual", inputSchema: "{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Generated schema for Root",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "action": {
      "type": "string"
    }…[truncated]"
4. **OpenRouter Chat Model** `lmChatOpenRouter` — model: `latitudegames/wayfarer-large-70b-llama-3.3`
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1100", height: "360"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "280", height: "560", content: "## Start
**Trigger** input from the calling process."
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "560", content: "## AI Agent
**Prompt** input to find data."
8. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "560", content: "## Output
**Parser** to grab the AI results into a JSON structure, according to the specified schema."
9. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280", height: "560"
10. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1500", height: "940"
11. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "2620", content: "## Adaptability
**Customize** this template:
* Update the AI model prompt with details specific to your API or OAuth2 setup.
* Adjust the JSON schema in the Structured Output node …[truncated]"
12. **LLM Bus** `chainLlm` — text: "[redacted]", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
13. **Conform JSON** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving and verifying OAuth2 settings for a service. When triggered by another workflow, it uses an AI model to generate OAuth2 configuration details such as service name, audience, authorization URI, and token URI. The AI also assigns a confidence score to indicate the reliability of the information. The results are structured into a JSON format for easy integration with other processes.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer building an app that integrates with multiple third-party APIs could use this workflow to automatically fetch and verify OAuth2 settings, saving time and ensuring accuracy in the configuration process.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect the workflow to trigger from another process.  
3. Configure the AI model prompt to match your API's details.  
4. Adjust the JSON schema for the output to fit your needs.  
5. Test with an example API service to ensure it retrieves the correct OAuth2 settings.

**Practice:**  
Create a test scenario by using a mock API service name. Run the workflow to see how it generates OAuth2 settings and assigns a confidence score. Adjust the AI prompt or JSON schema to see how changes affect the output.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated OAuth2 configuration services, enhancing your value proposition as a consultant or developer. It streamlines integration tasks, reduces errors, and can be a unique selling point in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openRouterApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
