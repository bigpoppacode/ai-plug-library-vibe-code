# Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, agent, chatTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Discord MCP Client** `mcpClientTool` — sseEndpoint: "http://localhost:5678/mcp/404f083e-f3f4-4358-83ef-9804099ee253/sse"
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "280", height: "360", content: "## Natural Language Input
You can call from another workflow, hit the chat endpoint, or even hit from another Discord bot if you wanted to! Any natural language command should work…[truncated]"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "540", content: "## Tool enabled agent
If you are going to swap the model out, just make sure that it's one that can handle tools. No special system prompt should be needed for the large cloud mode…[truncated]"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — height: "540", content: "## Discord MCP Client/Server
This is totally customizable (you can connect it to any MCP server by changing the URL), but if you need a starting point, you can check out my "Manage…[truncated]"
8. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle chat messages received on a platform like Discord. When a chat message is received, it triggers the workflow, which uses the OpenAI Chat Model to process the message and generate a response. The AI Agent node manages the interaction, and the Discord MCP Client node ensures communication with the Discord platform. This setup allows for natural language processing and automated responses within a Discord server.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support in a Discord community. It provides instant responses to common questions, improving customer service efficiency and freeing up human resources for more complex inquiries.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Discord and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set up the chat message trigger to listen for messages on your Discord server.
4. Customize the OpenAI model settings to suit your needs.
5. Test the workflow by sending messages to your Discord server and observing the AI-generated responses.

### Practice
Create a test Discord server and invite a few friends. Implement the workflow and test various natural language commands. Observe how the AI responds and adjust the model settings to improve accuracy and relevance.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer automated customer support services, reducing operational costs and increasing customer satisfaction. It positions you as a provider of advanced AI solutions, attracting clients seeking efficient communication automation in their businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
