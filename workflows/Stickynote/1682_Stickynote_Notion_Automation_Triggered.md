# Stickynote Notion Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Drive Trigger**.
2. **Google Drive Trigger** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "459.0695038476583", height: "425.9351190986499", content: "## Trigger and Download of audio file

In this example I'm using Google Drive. 
As soon as a audio file is uploaded the trigger will start and download the audio file. "
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "516.8340993895782", height: "420.4856289531857"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "231.28081576725737", height: "411.7664447204431", content: "## Sending to Notion

We now send the summary to a new Notion page."
6. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
7. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **audio**, operation: **transcribe**
8. **OpenAI1** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
9. **Notion** `notion` — title: "={{ JSON.parse($json.message.content).audioContentSummary.title }} ", pageId: "[object Object]", blockUi: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of transcribing and summarizing audio files. When a new audio file is uploaded to a specified Google Drive folder, the workflow triggers, downloads the file, and sends it to OpenAI for transcription. The transcribed text is then processed to generate a summary, which is subsequently sent to Notion as a new page entry.

**Demonstrate**  
A consultant could use this workflow to automatically transcribe and summarize meeting recordings stored in Google Drive, making it easier to document and share key points with team members via Notion.

**Imitate**  
1. Set up a Google Drive folder and connect it to n8n.  
2. Configure the trigger to detect new files in this folder.  
3. Use the OpenAI node to transcribe audio files.  
4. Set up a Notion account and connect it to n8n.  
5. Configure the Notion node to create a new page with the transcription summary.

**Practice**  
Create a test Google Drive folder and upload an audio file. Run the workflow to see how it transcribes and summarizes the content into Notion. Adjust the summary format in Notion to better suit your needs.

**WIIFM (What's In It For Me)**  
Mastering this workflow helps you offer transcription and summarization services, saving clients time and enhancing productivity. It positions you as a valuable resource in AI automation, potentially leading to increased income and customer retention in your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, notionApi, openAiApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
