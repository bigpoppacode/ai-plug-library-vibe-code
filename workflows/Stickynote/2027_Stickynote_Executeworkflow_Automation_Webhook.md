# Stickynote ExecuteWorkflow Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Workflow Input Trigger**.
2. **Analytics Agent Brain** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **Analytics Agent Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
4. **OpenSea Get Collection Stats** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/collections/{collection_slug}/stats`
5. **Workflow Input Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
6. **OpenSea Get Events** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/events`
7. **OpenSea Get Events by Account** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/events/accounts/{address}`
8. **OpenSea Get Events by Collection** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/events/collection/{collection_slug}`
9. **OpenSea Get Events by NFT** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/events/chain/{chain}/contract/{address}/nfts/{identifier}`
10. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "980", height: "1320"
11. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "920", height: "940"
12. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "820", height: "460"
13. **OpenSea Analytics Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.message }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain**: This n8n workflow is designed to analyze NFT market data using OpenSea's API. It retrieves and processes statistics on NFT collections, transaction histories, and specific events related to wallets, collections, and NFTs. The AI agent interprets this data to provide insights on market trends and price movements.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner or NFT investor might use this workflow to monitor market trends and make informed investment decisions. By analyzing collection statistics and transaction histories, they can identify promising opportunities and stay ahead of the market.

- **Imitate**: To apply this workflow, import it into your n8n instance. Connect your OpenSea API credentials and configure the input parameters like collection slug or wallet address. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves the desired analytics data and processes it correctly.

- **Practice**: Create a test workflow using a sample NFT collection slug. Run the workflow to gather statistics and events, then analyze the output to understand the data structure and insights provided by the AI agent.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can position you as an NFT analytics expert, helping you offer valuable insights to clients and investors. By providing data-driven analysis, you can enhance decision-making, attract customers, and generate income in the NFT space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
