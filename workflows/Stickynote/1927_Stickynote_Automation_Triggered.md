# Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — contextWindowLength: "20"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "340", content: "## SearchApi AI Agent
Whenever you ask a question that should be searched on the web, the AI Agent will use SearchAPI to do it. To run this workflow, you need to have the credentia…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "260", height: "120", content: "## Tip
You can change the node to use any of the engines available on [SearchAPI.io](https://www.searchapi.io/)"
6. **SearchApi** `searchApiTool` — parameters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
7. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
8. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates web searches using a chat interface. When a chat message is received, it triggers an AI agent that uses the SearchAPI to find information on the web. The workflow includes a memory buffer to maintain context and uses an AI model to process responses, making it suitable for answering questions that require web searches.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create a virtual assistant that answers customer inquiries by searching the web for up-to-date information, enhancing customer service without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your SearchAPI and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set up a chat trigger to start the workflow.
4. Customize the workflow to fit your use case, like customer support or research.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and processes information correctly.

### Practice
Create a test chat environment and send queries that require web searches. Observe how the workflow retrieves and processes information. Try modifying search parameters and AI responses to see how it affects results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer advanced virtual assistant services, automating customer interactions and information retrieval. This can save time, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams in AI-driven automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
