# Stickynote Create Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, chatTrigger, lmChatGoogleGemini.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: ""
3. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "260", height: "220", content: "👇 **Prompt Engineering**
   - Define agent personality and conversation structure in the `Construct & Execute LLM Prompt` node's template variable  
   - ⚠️ Template must preserve…[truncated]"
5. **Store conversation history** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "420", height: "240"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — height: "100", content: "👆 **Interface Settings**
Configure chat UI elements (e.g., title) in the `When Chat Message Received` node  "
8. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "200", height: "140", content: "👆 **Model Selection**
Swap language models through the `language model` input field in `Construct & Execute LLM Prompt`  "
9. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "200", height: "140", content: "👆 **Memory Control**
Adjust conversation history length in the `Store Conversation History` node  "
10. **Construct & Execute LLM Prompt** `code` — code: "[object Object]", inputs: "[object Object]", outputs: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to create a custom AI chat agent using the Google Gemini language model. It begins with a chat message trigger, processes the message using the Gemini model, and constructs a response based on a predefined persona. The workflow stores conversation history to maintain context, allowing the AI to provide coherent and contextually aware responses over multiple interactions.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to build a virtual assistant that interacts with users in a specific tone and style, such as a customer service agent that offers consistent support while adhering to company guidelines.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Set up your Google Gemini API credentials.
3. Customize the agent's personality and response style in the "Construct & Execute LLM Prompt" node.
4. Test the chat interface by sending messages to see how the AI responds.
5. Adjust model settings and conversation memory as needed.

### Practice
Create a simple chat interface using this workflow. Experiment by changing the agent's persona and test how the AI's responses change. Try adding different conversation scenarios to see how well the AI maintains context.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer custom AI-driven chat solutions to businesses, enhancing customer engagement and support. This can lead to new revenue streams by providing tailored AI services that improve customer interaction and satisfaction.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
