## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling incoming emails. It begins with a Gmail trigger that detects new emails, followed by filtering emails from existing contacts. It then classifies the emails using a text classifier to determine if they are related to guest posts, YouTube inquiries, or Udemy courses. Based on the classification, it sends an appropriate email response. After responding, it marks the email as read, applies a label, and creates a contact in Brevo for future communication.

**Demonstrate:**  
A consultant could use this workflow to manage client inquiries efficiently, ensuring each type of inquiry receives a tailored response, enhancing client satisfaction and reducing manual email sorting.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail and Brevo accounts.
3. Set up the Gmail trigger and text classifier categories.
4. Customize email responses for each category.
5. Activate the workflow and test with sample emails.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Gmail account and send different types of emails (guest post, YouTube inquiry, etc.) to it. Run the workflow and observe how it automatically classifies and responds to each email, updating records in Brevo.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email management services, saving businesses time and improving response efficiency. This skill can attract clients seeking to streamline their communication processes, leading to potential business growth and increased revenue.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, googlePalmApi, smtp, sendInBlueApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
