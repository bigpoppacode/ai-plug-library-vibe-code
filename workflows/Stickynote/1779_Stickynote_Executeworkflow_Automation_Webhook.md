# Stickynote ExecuteWorkflow Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Workflow Input Trigger**.
2. **NFT Agent Brain** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **NFT Agent Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
4. **Workflow Input Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
5. **OpenSea Get Account** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/accounts/{address_or_username}`
6. **OpenSea Get Collection** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/collections/{collection_slug}`
7. **OpenSea Get Collections** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/collections`
8. **OpenSea Get Contract** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/chain/{chain}/contract/{address}`
9. **OpenSea Get NFT** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/chain/{chain}/contract/{address}/nfts/{identifier}`
10. **OpenSea Get NFTs by Account** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/chain/{chain}/account/{address}/nfts`
11. **OpenSea Get NFTs by Collection** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/collection/{collection_slug}/nfts`
12. **OpenSea Get NFTs by Contract** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/chain/{chain}/contract/{address}/nfts`
13. **OpenSea Get Payment Token** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`
14. **OpenSea Get Traits** `toolHttpRequest` — url: `https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/traits/{collection_slug}`
15. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "920", height: "1880"
16. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1000", height: "1060"
17. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "840", height: "480"
18. **OpenSea NFT Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.message }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to interact with OpenSea's API to retrieve and analyze NFT-related data. It uses AI to process requests for information about user profiles, NFT collections, contracts, individual NFTs, and payment tokens. The workflow can fetch data by accounts, collections, and contracts, providing structured insights for NFT collectors, investors, or analysts.

### Demonstrate
A business owner dealing in NFTs could use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze data on NFT collections, helping them make informed investment decisions based on real-time market insights.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenSea account for API access.
3. Modify the workflow to include your specific NFT collection slugs or account addresses.
4. Set up triggers to run the workflow automatically at desired intervals.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and processes the correct data.

### Practice
Create a sample collection on OpenSea and use this workflow to retrieve its details. Experiment with fetching data by account and contract to see how the workflow adapts to different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer NFT data analysis services, providing clients with valuable insights into the NFT market. This can differentiate your automation business, attract more customers, and generate additional income through specialized NFT analytics.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
