# MQTT Topic Monitor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## MQTT Topic Monitor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/mqtt_topic_monitor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "mqtt_topic_monitor"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "mqtt_topic_monitor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors MQTT topics by receiving data through a webhook, processing it with AI and Redis, and storing it in Google Sheets. It begins by receiving data via a webhook, splits and processes the data with AI embeddings, stores it in a Redis vector store, queries the data for insights, and finally logs the results in a Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to monitor and log IoT sensor data. By processing and analyzing the data in real-time, they can gain insights into device performance or environmental conditions, improving decision-making and operational efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a POST webhook to receive MQTT data.
3. Connect your Redis and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Customize the AI processing to fit your data analysis needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it logs data correctly.

### Practice
Create a test MQTT topic and simulate data being sent to the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the data and logs it in Google Sheets. Adjust the AI processing steps to improve data insights.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time data monitoring and analysis services, enhancing IoT solutions for clients. This capability can attract new customers and create recurring revenue streams in the AI automation space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, redisApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
