# Sensor Fault Detector
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Sensor Fault Detector", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/sensor_fault_detector`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "sensor_fault_detector"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "sensor_fault_detector"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to detect faults in sensor data. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, splits the data into chunks, and generates embeddings using OpenAI. The embeddings are stored in a Supabase vector store. The workflow then queries this data for analysis, utilizes a language model for chat, and stores the results and memory in Google Sheets, keeping a log of detected sensor faults.

### Demonstrate
A manufacturing company could use this workflow to automatically monitor sensor data for faults, ensuring timely maintenance and reducing downtime. This proactive approach helps maintain efficiency and prevent costly disruptions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive sensor data.
3. Connect your Supabase and OpenAI accounts.
4. Customize the Google Sheets setup for logging.
5. Test the workflow with sample sensor data to ensure it logs faults accurately.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by simulating faulty sensor data and running it through the workflow. Observe how the workflow processes the data, stores embeddings, and logs results in Google Sheets. Adjust parameters to refine fault detection.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated monitoring solutions to businesses, enhancing their operational efficiency. This capability can attract clients looking for innovative ways to maintain system health, providing an opportunity to generate income through automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
