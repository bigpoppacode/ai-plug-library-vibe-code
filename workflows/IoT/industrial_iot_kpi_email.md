# Industrial Iot Kpi Email
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Industrial IoT KPI Email", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/industrial_iot_kpi_email`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "industrial_iot_kpi_email"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "industrial_iot_kpi_email"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing Industrial IoT KPI data. It starts with a webhook that receives data, splits the information for processing, and uses AI to generate insights or responses. The data is then stored in a Redis vector store for retrieval, and the final insights are appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate:**  
A manufacturer could use this workflow to automatically process and analyze IoT data from factory equipment, generating timely insights that are logged in a Google Sheet for operational efficiency and decision-making.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the webhook to receive IoT data.
3. Connect your Redis and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Adjust the AI settings to process your specific KPI needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is processed and logged correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a sample dataset of IoT KPIs and use the workflow to process and log the data. Check the Google Sheet for accuracy and modify the workflow to handle additional data points or generate more detailed insights.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer IoT data management solutions, enhancing operational efficiency for clients. This can lead to increased service offerings and revenue in your automation business, positioning you as an expert in industrial automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, redisApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
