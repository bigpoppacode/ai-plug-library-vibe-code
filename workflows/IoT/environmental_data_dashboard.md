# Environmental Data Dashboard
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Environmental Data Dashboard", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/environmental_data_dashboard`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "environmental_data_dashboard"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "environmental_data_dashboard"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to manage and process environmental data. It begins by receiving data through a webhook. The data is split into manageable chunks and converted into vector embeddings using OpenAI's model. These embeddings are then inserted into a Weaviate vector store for efficient querying and retrieval. The workflow also includes an AI agent that can interact with the data and a Google Sheet node to log the interactions or results for further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A consultancy firm could use this workflow to process and analyze large volumes of environmental data, facilitating real-time insights and decision-making for sustainability projects. This automation enhances data accessibility and usability.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the webhook to receive data.
3. Configure Weaviate and OpenAI credentials.
4. Adjust the Google Sheet node to log results.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it processes and logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a small dataset of environmental statistics. Run the workflow to see how it processes and logs the data. Experiment by querying the vector store to retrieve specific information and observe how the AI agent interacts with the data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer advanced data processing and analysis services. By efficiently managing large datasets, you can help clients make informed decisions, enhancing your service portfolio and potentially increasing income through value-added services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
