# Predictive Maintenance Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Predictive Maintenance Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/predictive_maintenance_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "predictive_maintenance_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "predictive_maintenance_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow automates the process of handling predictive maintenance alerts. It receives alerts via a webhook, processes the data to create embeddings, and stores it in a Weaviate vector database. The workflow retrieves relevant data, uses AI to process it, and logs results in a Google Sheet. This ensures efficient data handling and alert management.

**Demonstrate**  
A manufacturing company could use this workflow to automate the monitoring of machinery. By processing maintenance alerts, they can predict failures, schedule timely interventions, and minimize downtime, thus saving costs and improving operational efficiency.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the webhook to receive alerts.  
3. Connect Weaviate and OpenAI for processing.  
4. Customize the Google Sheet for logging data.  
5. Test the workflow with sample alerts to ensure it logs and processes data correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test scenario where you simulate sending maintenance alerts to the webhook. Observe how the data flows through the workflow, gets processed, and logs into the Google Sheet. Adjust parameters to see the different outcomes.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow empowers you to provide predictive maintenance solutions, enhancing client operations by reducing downtime and maintenance costs. This capability can increase your service offerings, attract new clients, and generate additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
