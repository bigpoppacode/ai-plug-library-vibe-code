# Smart Home Energy Saver
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Smart Home Energy Saver", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/smart_home_energy_saver`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "smart_home_energy_saver"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "smart_home_energy_saver"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to process and analyze data related to smart home energy usage. It begins with a webhook that receives data and splits it into smaller chunks for processing. The data is then transformed into embeddings using Cohere's model and stored in a Supabase vector database. The workflow queries this database to retrieve relevant information, which is then processed by an AI agent. Finally, the results are appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping and further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A smart home technology company could use this workflow to analyze energy usage data from its devices. By processing this data, the company can provide users with insights into their energy consumption patterns, helping them optimize usage and reduce costs.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a POST webhook to receive smart home data.
3. Configure your Supabase and Cohere accounts.
4. Ensure the Google Sheet is ready to log data.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to verify it logs insights correctly.

### Practice
Create a small dataset representing energy usage and upload it through the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes it, storing embeddings and appending insights to the Google Sheet. Adjust parameters and run tests to see different outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer advanced data analytics services to smart home companies. By providing insights into energy consumption, you can help clients optimize their products, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction, thus expanding your service portfolio and increasing revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
