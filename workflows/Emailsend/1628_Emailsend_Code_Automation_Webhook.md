  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of identifying potential real estate leads. It searches for properties based on specified criteria, retrieves owner contact information, and compiles the data into an Excel file and a CRM system. It can be triggered manually or scheduled to run daily, ensuring consistent lead generation.

- **Demonstrate:** A real estate agency uses this workflow to automate the search for distressed properties with high equity. This helps them quickly target and contact potential sellers, improving the efficiency of their lead generation efforts.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into your n8n instance. Configure the search parameters in the "Set" node to match your target property criteria. Connect your CRM and email accounts. Schedule the workflow to run daily. Test the workflow to ensure it outputs the expected results.

- **Practice:** Create a test scenario by setting up a mock property database. Run the workflow to see how it identifies leads and processes the data. Adjust the filtering criteria and observe the changes in lead selection.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated lead generation services to real estate professionals. It enhances your service offerings, increases customer satisfaction by providing timely leads, and can serve as a foundation for building a scalable AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
