# HTTP Schedule Send Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, scheduleTrigger, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Get Elastic Alert (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Send Email Notification (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Response is not empty (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: No Operation, do nothing (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Loop Over Each Alert Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: No Operation, end of loop (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking alerts from an Elastic API, sending email notifications for relevant alerts, and doing nothing if there are no alerts. It runs on a schedule, ensuring timely responses to potential issues.

### Demonstrate
A tech company could use this workflow to receive real-time alerts about system performance. When an alert is triggered, the workflow sends an email notification to the IT team, allowing them to respond quickly and minimize downtime.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** to check for alerts at regular intervals.
2. Add an **HTTP Request** node to get alerts from your Elastic API.
3. Use an **If Node** to check if the response is not empty.
4. If alerts exist, loop through them with **SplitInBatches** and send an email for each alert.
5. Test and adjust email content as needed.

### Practice
Create a simple version of the workflow to check for new emails in your inbox. Set it to send a notification if new emails are found. Experiment with different triggers and conditions to see how they affect the outcome.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate alert management, improving response times and reducing manual checks. This skill can be monetized by offering automation services to businesses needing efficient monitoring and alert systems, leading to potential income growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get Elastic Alert" and "No Operation, end of loop" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
