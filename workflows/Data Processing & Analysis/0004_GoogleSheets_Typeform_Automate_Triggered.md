## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the collection of course feedback via Typeform. When a feedback form is submitted, it checks if the feedback is positive. If it is, it logs the feedback in a Google Sheet for positive responses; otherwise, it logs negative feedback in a different sheet.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline feedback collection for a course. Instead of manually sorting through responses, they can automatically categorize feedback into positive and negative sheets, saving time and improving response analysis.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform to collect feedback.
2. Add a Typeform Trigger node in n8n.
3. Create an IF node to filter feedback based on usefulness.
4. Use two Google Sheets nodes: one for positive feedback and one for negative.
5. Test the workflow by submitting sample feedback.

### Practice
Create your own feedback form using Typeform, link it to n8n, and set up logging to Google Sheets. Experiment by submitting both positive and negative feedback to see how it sorts the data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate feedback collection, saving you time and increasing accuracy in data handling, which can enhance customer satisfaction and retention, making it a valuable service for businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Typeform Trigger" and "Google Sheets1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
