## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering and summarizing financial news. It extracts content from a financial website, processes it, and sends a structured email summary daily at 7 AM.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically receive daily financial news summaries via email, allowing them to stay informed without dedicating time to read multiple sources, thus enhancing decision-making efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily.
2. Use **HTTP Request** to fetch news from a financial site.
3. **Extract HTML Content** using CSS selectors for headlines.
4. Combine the extracted content with a **Set Node**.
5. Use an **AI Agent** to summarize the news.
6. Send the summary via **Microsoft Outlook**.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that fetches and emails news from a different website. Experiment with different extraction methods and CSS selectors to see how it affects the summary content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services, helping clients save time and stay informed, ultimately leading to more efficient operations and potential income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Extract specific content" and "Send the summary by e-mail" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
