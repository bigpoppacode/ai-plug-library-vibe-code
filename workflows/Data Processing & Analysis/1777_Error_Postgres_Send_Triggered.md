# Error Postgres Send Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving errorTrigger, postgres, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Error Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Error Trigger (errorTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Insert Log (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Count for 5 minutes (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Principal E-Mail (emailSend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Fallback E-Mail (emailSend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Push mobile notification (pushover)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Truncate Log Database (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sometimes... just cleanup (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Call this Sample - Prepend to your error catcher (executeWorkflow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: See below to prepend this at your error handling (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: If there is no logs in 5 minutes (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: CleanUp execution. See below if you will prepend this workflow (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Insert your error handling logic after this (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow logs errors that occur during execution, limits email notifications to avoid spamming, and cleans up logs after a set period. It captures error details, counts occurrences, and triggers alerts only after a defined time, ensuring efficient error handling.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to manage application errors without overwhelming their team with notifications. For instance, if a web application crashes, this workflow logs the error, sends a notification every five minutes if needed, and keeps the team informed without spamming them.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a trigger for error events.
3. Configure logging in your PostgreSQL database.
4. Adjust email and notification settings for your team.
5. Test it by forcing an error in your application to see how the workflow responds.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only logs errors to a database. Simulate an error by using a manual trigger and ensure it captures the error details correctly. Review the logs to confirm the workflow's functionality.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you provide value to clients by improving their error management processes. It minimizes downtime, enhances communication, and can be packaged as a service, allowing you to charge for ongoing support and maintenance as part of an automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Error Trigger" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
