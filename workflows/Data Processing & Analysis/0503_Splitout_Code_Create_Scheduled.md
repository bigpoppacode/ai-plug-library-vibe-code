## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the management of a Spotify "Downloads" playlist. It checks for new liked tracks, adds them to the playlist, and removes older tracks to maintain a defined limit, ensuring users always have an up-to-date selection of their favorite songs.

### Demonstrate
A music enthusiast could use this workflow to automatically maintain a Spotify playlist of their favorite songs, ensuring they only keep the latest 50 liked tracks. This saves time spent manually updating playlists and frees up space on their devices.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Schedule Trigger to run daily.
3. Use Spotify nodes to check for liked tracks and create a "Downloads" playlist if it doesn't exist.
4. Use code nodes to filter new tracks and remove older ones.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates the playlist correctly.

### Practice
Experiment by adjusting the `download_limit` in the Globals node to see how it affects the number of tracks kept in the "Downloads" playlist. Try adding new liked tracks and observe how the workflow manages the playlist.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automation services to music lovers, enhancing their Spotify experience. It demonstrates your ability to create practical solutions, helping you attract clients who value time-saving automations in their daily lives.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "If no playlist" and "Globals" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
