# Code Webhook Automate Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving webhook, code, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook. It acts as a live API endpoint.
2. **Step 1: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Code (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: user info (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: send back login page (respondToWebhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: IF token is present (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Welcome page (html)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: send back welcome page (respondToWebhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: IF user info ok (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: login form (html)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Set variables : auth, token, userinfo, client id, scope (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: IF we have code in URI and not in PKCE mode (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: get access_token from /token endpoint with code (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of user authentication using OpenID Connect (OIDC). It starts with a webhook to receive requests, processes user info, and responds with either a login form or a welcome page, depending on whether the user is authenticated.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline user logins for a web application. Instead of manually managing user sessions, this automated workflow handles authentication, improving user experience and security.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive login requests.
2. Use a Code node to process cookies and extract user info.
3. Implement HTTP requests to validate user credentials via an OIDC provider.
4. Use IF nodes to determine whether to show a login form or welcome page.
5. Respond with appropriate HTML content based on authentication status.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only handles user login without OIDC. Use a manual trigger to simulate user input, and respond with a welcome message if a predefined username and password are correct.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables students to offer automated authentication solutions, enhancing security and user experience for clients. This skill can lead to valuable service offerings in web development and system integration, ultimately generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "get access_token from /token endpoint with code" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
