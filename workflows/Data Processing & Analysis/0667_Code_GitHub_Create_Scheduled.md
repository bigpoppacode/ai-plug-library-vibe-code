# Code Github Create Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, n8n.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works

2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: n8n (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Return (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get File (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: If file too large (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Merge Items (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: isDiffOrNew (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Check Status (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Same file - Do nothing (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: File is different (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: File is new (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Create new file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Edit existing file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Get file data (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Globals (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
22. **Step 21: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

24. **Step 23: Execute Workflow (executeWorkflow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up workflows to GitHub. It checks for new or modified workflows, retrieves their data, and either updates existing files or creates new ones in a specified GitHub repository.

### Demonstrate
A consultant can use this workflow to ensure that their client's automation configurations are backed up regularly on GitHub, providing peace of mind and an easy recovery option in case of accidental deletions or errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n and add a **Manual Trigger**.
2. Set up GitHub credentials in n8n.
3. Add nodes to **retrieve** workflows and **check** if they are new or modified.
4. Use an **If Node** to decide whether to create or edit files based on the workflow status.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly backs up to GitHub.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to back up to a different repository or add an email notification step when a backup is successful. This will help you understand how to customize workflows further.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer clients reliable backup solutions, enhancing their data security and increasing your value as a consultant, which can lead to more contracts and higher fees.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Execute Workflow" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
