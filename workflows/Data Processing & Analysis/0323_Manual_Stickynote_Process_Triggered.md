# Manual Stickynote Process Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, chainLlm.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Basic LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Prompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Auto-fixing Output Parser (outputParserAutofixing)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process starting with a manual trigger. It collects input through a prompt, processes it with AI, and utilizes OpenAI's models to generate structured outputs, ensuring data is formatted correctly before saving it to a database or sending it elsewhere.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate answering customer queries. For instance, when a customer submits a request, the workflow can analyze the input, generate a response using AI, and log the interaction for future reference, saving time and enhancing customer service.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow and add a **Manual Trigger**.
2. Add a **Set Node** to define your prompt.
3. Connect to the **OpenAI Chat Model** to process the prompt.
4. Use an **Output Parser** to format the AI response.
5. Save the output to a **Google Sheets** or similar database.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the prompt or output format. For example, ask the AI to summarize a recent blog post instead of generating a list. Execute the workflow to see how the changes affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps streamline repetitive tasks, enhances productivity, and allows you to offer valuable automation services. This can attract clients seeking efficiency, paving the way for new business opportunities and potential income streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Structured Output Parser" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
