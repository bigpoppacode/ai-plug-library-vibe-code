## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching trending "Show HN" items from Hacker News, checks if they meet certain criteria, and sends an email summarizing the results. It uses various nodes for tasks like HTTP requests, HTML extraction, and conditional logic.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically monitor Hacker News for trending products or startups, sending daily email updates to their team. This saves time on manual checks and keeps everyone informed on industry trends.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Cron node to trigger daily.
3. Configure the HTTP Request to fetch Hacker News data.
4. Use HTML Extract nodes to pull relevant data (title, rank).
5. Implement the IF node to filter results.
6. Set up the Send Email node to notify your team.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch data from a different source (like Reddit) and adjust the email content to include additional details. This will help you understand how to adapt existing workflows for new applications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data monitoring tasks, providing value to clients by saving them time and keeping them updated. This skill can help you attract customers looking for efficient automation solutions, potentially increasing your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "IF" and "HTML Extract Data" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
