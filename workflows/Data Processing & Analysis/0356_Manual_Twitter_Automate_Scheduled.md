## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring Twitter mentions of "n8n.io" by fetching new tweets and sending notifications to a RocketChat channel. It triggers every minute, filters out previously seen tweets, and sends relevant data as alerts.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to monitor brand mentions on Twitter. For example, a marketing manager could get immediate alerts in RocketChat when customers tweet about their brand, allowing for swift engagement and improved customer relations.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron** node to trigger every minute.
3. Use the **Twitter** node to search for mentions of your brand.
4. Add a **Set** node to filter tweet data (e.g., tweet text, ID, URL).
5. Implement a **Function** node to check for new tweets.
6. Connect to the **RocketChat** node to send notifications with the tweet details.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to monitor a different hashtag or keyword on Twitter. Change the search term in the Twitter node and observe how the workflow behaves with the new input. Experiment with different notification messages in RocketChat.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer social media monitoring as a service, enhancing client engagement strategies. By automating brand mention alerts, you can help businesses respond faster to customer feedback, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
