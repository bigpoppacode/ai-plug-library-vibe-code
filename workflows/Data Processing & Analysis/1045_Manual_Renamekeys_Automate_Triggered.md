# Manual Renamekeys Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, renameKeys.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Rename Keys (renameKeys)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user manually triggers a workflow, sets a value, and then renames a key before proceeding to the next steps. It's useful for transforming data formats or preparing data for further processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the renaming of data fields in a customer feedback form submission. This ensures that the data is consistent and correctly labeled before being stored in a database, improving data integrity.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n and add a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add a **Set** node to define a key-value pair (e.g., key: "customerFeedback", value: "Great service!").
3. Add a **Rename Keys** node to change "customerFeedback" to "feedback".
4. Execute the workflow to see the output.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding another **Set** node before the **Rename Keys** node to include an additional field (e.g., "customerName"). Then, run the workflow and check the renamed output to reinforce understanding.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data processing tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient data management solutions, enhancing your value as an automation consultant and increasing potential income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Rename Keys" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
