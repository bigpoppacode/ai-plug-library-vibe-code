## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking cryptocurrency price changes every few minutes. It retrieves data from the Binance API, filters for significant price changes (over 10%), and sends a summary of these changes as a message via Telegram.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to monitor cryptocurrency prices, receiving instant alerts for significant fluctuations. This enables timely trading decisions or client notifications, enhancing investment strategies and customer engagement.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to set the frequency (e.g., every 5 minutes).
3. Use the **HTTP Request** node to fetch Binance price data.
4. Implement a **Function** node to filter results for 10% price changes.
5. Add a **Telegram node** to send alerts with the filtered data.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it operates correctly.

### Practice
Create a modified version of this workflow that tracks a different cryptocurrency or uses a different messaging platform (like Slack). Experiment with changing the percentage threshold for price changes to see how it affects the alerts you receive.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients in the finance and investment sectors. By providing real-time updates and insights, you can help businesses make informed decisions, thereby increasing your value as an automation consultant and boosting your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
