# HTTP Typeform Monitor Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving typeformTrigger, httpRequest, mindee.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get Receipt** node.
2. **Step 1: Get Receipt (typeformTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Extract Information (mindee)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set Information (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Store Information (airtable)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of tracking expenses by collecting receipt images via Typeform, extracting data from the images using AI (Mindee), and storing the information in Airtable for easy management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline expense tracking by automatically capturing receipt info. This saves time compared to manual entry, allowing them to focus on strategic tasks instead of tedious paperwork.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform to collect receipt images.
2. Add a webhook trigger in n8n to start the workflow when a new form is submitted.
3. Use an HTTP request node to fetch the receipt image.
4. Implement the Mindee node to extract data from the image.
5. Use a Set node to organize the extracted data.
6. Store the data in Airtable for tracking.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow: use a Typeform to collect a single receipt image, extract the amount using a basic function node (mocking the AI), and log it into a Google Sheet instead of Airtable.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services, increase client efficiency, and generate income by positioning yourself as a specialist in automating expense management processes for businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get Receipt" and "Store Information" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
