## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting the title tag and meta description from URLs stored in an Airtable database. When triggered, it retrieves URLs, fetches their content, extracts the required data, and updates the Airtable records accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A digital marketing consultant could use this workflow to automatically gather SEO data from multiple web pages. By running this automation, they can efficiently enhance their clients' websites without manually checking each page, saving time and improving SEO strategies.

### Imitate
1. Set up an Airtable base with a table containing columns for `url`, `title tag`, and `meta desc`.
2. Create a new n8n workflow and add a **Manual Trigger**.
3. Add a **Get records** node to fetch URLs from Airtable.
4. Use an **HTTP Request** node to get the webpage content for each URL.
5. Add an **HTML Extract** node to pull the title and meta description.
6. Finally, add an **Update record** node to write the extracted data back to Airtable.

### Practice
Try adding new URLs to your Airtable and run the workflow. Check if the title tags and meta descriptions are accurately filled in. Experiment with different URLs to see how the workflow handles various webpage structures.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable SEO services, helping clients improve their online visibility. This skill can attract customers looking for automation and SEO solutions, potentially generating significant income as part of your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
