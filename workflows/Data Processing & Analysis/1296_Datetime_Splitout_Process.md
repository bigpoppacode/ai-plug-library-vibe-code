# Datetime Splitout Process

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving emailReadImap, dateTime, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Email Trigger (IMAP)** node.
2. **Step 1: Email Trigger (IMAP) (emailReadImap)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: End date format (dateTime)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: If multiple records to parse (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Map fields for DB input and parse (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Begin format date (dateTime)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Input into database (mySql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: If issue with DKIM or SPF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Rename Keys (renameKeys)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Rename column for consistency (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Unzip File (compression)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Extract XML data (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Parse XML data to JSON (xml)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Split Out For Separate Entries (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Slack Post Message On Channel (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Send Error Notification Email (emailSend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the parsing of DMARC reports received via email. It extracts relevant data from the reports, formats it, and saves it into a MySQL database. It also sends notifications if there are issues with email authentication (DKIM or SPF).

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the handling of DMARC reports, ensuring they receive timely alerts about email deliverability issues. This helps improve email security and maintain a good sender reputation without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Set up an IMAP email trigger to read incoming DMARC reports.
2. Add nodes to unzip attachments and extract XML data.
3. Use a function to parse the XML to JSON format.
4. Map the fields for database input.
5. Insert the parsed data into a MySQL database.
6. Add conditions to check for DKIM/SPF issues and send notifications.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new notification method, such as sending a message via Slack when a DMARC report indicates an issue. This will help you understand how to integrate different services within n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate email handling and data processing, creating value for clients by improving their email security and operational efficiency. This expertise can help you attract new customers and generate income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Email Trigger (IMAP)" and "Send Error Notification Email" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
