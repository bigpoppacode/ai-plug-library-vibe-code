## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow generates an image based on specified properties like size, background color, text color, and font. It starts with a manual trigger, fetches an image from an API, and sets the defined properties before producing the final output.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to create branded images for social media posts automatically. For instance, generating promotional graphics with specific colors and messages based on daily sales campaigns helps maintain consistent branding without manual design work.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch an image, setting the URL with dynamic parameters.
4. Use a **Set** node to define image properties like size, colors, and text.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to generate the image.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the text and colors in the **Set Image Properties** node. Execute it to see how different inputs affect the generated image. Experiment with various sizes and formats (like PNG or JPEG).

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content creation for clients, saving time and enhancing their marketing efforts. By offering image generation as a service, you can attract more clients, increase your value proposition, and potentially boost your income through automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Set Image Properties" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
