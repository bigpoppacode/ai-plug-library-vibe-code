## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving company information based on a company name. It starts with a manual trigger, creates a company item, retrieves data from an external service, and finally checks if the company was found.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly access information about potential partners or clients by simply entering a company name. This saves time and improves decision-making in outreach efforts.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Use a Function Item node to create a company object with a name and country.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch company details using the name.
4. Use an IF node to check if the company was found and proceed accordingly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to retrieve information for multiple companies by looping through an array of names. This will reinforce how to handle data in n8n and expand your workflow capabilities.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide automated solutions to clients, saving them time and enhancing their data retrieval processes. This skill can lead to more clients and increased revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Company Found?" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
