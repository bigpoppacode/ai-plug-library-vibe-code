## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates meal planning by retrieving recipes from an API, generating a random meal plan for upcoming days, and saving it. It triggers weekly on Fridays at 8 PM or can be tested manually.

### Demonstrate
A restaurant owner could use this workflow to automate weekly meal planning, saving time on menu creation and ensuring a variety of dishes are offered. This efficiency can lead to better customer satisfaction and streamlined operations.

### Imitate
1. In n8n, create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** for Fridays at 8 PM.
3. Use an **HTTP Request** to fetch recipes from your chosen API.
4. Set up a **Function Node** to randomly select recipes.
5. Add another **HTTP Request** to create a meal plan with selected recipes.
6. Test the workflow and adjust parameters as needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the trigger to a manual one and test it by adding new recipe categories. Observe how the outputs change based on different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate meal planning, which can be a valuable service for restaurants or meal prep businesses, enabling you to save time, reduce costs, and potentially increase your income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Friday 8pm" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
