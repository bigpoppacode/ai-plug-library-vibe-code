## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring G2 reviews for specific competitors. It scrapes new reviews daily, checks if they are new, and sends notifications to Slack and logs them in Google Sheets, ensuring that users stay updated without manual checks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to track competitor reviews in real-time. For instance, a SaaS company might want to know what users are saying about competitors like Zendesk or Intercom to adjust their marketing strategy or improve their own product offerings.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a schedule trigger to run daily.
3. Add competitors in the "Add your competitors here" node.
4. Configure ScrapingBee API key in the HTTP Request node.
5. Connect Google Sheets and Slack to log reviews and send notifications.

### Practice
Try modifying the competitor names in the workflow to include your own competitors. Run the workflow and check if the new reviews are logged in Google Sheets and if notifications are sent to Slack.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate competitor analysis, saving time while providing valuable insights. This can attract clients looking for competitive intelligence solutions, helping you build a profitable automation service or consultancy.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Add your competitors here" and "Add new review to Google Sheets" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
