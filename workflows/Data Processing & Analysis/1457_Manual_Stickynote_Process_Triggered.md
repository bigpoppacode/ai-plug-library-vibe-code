# Manual Stickynote Process Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, chainLlm.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Prompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Auto-fixing Output Parser (outputParserAutofixing)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of querying data from an AI model based on a user prompt, parsing the output, and organizing it into a structured format for easy use or further processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically generate insights from customer feedback, such as identifying the five largest U.S. states and their cities, helping them analyze geographic trends in their customer base.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Create a prompt node with a specific query.
3. Add an AI model node to process the prompt.
4. Use structured and autofixing output parsers to format the response.
5. Store or display the results using a sticky note or another output node.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the workflow to ask for different data, like the largest tech companies, and observe how the output changes. This will help reinforce understanding of input/output dynamics.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline data analysis, enhance decision-making, and offer automated insights to clients, creating value that can lead to customer retention and increased income in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "OpenAI Chat Model1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
