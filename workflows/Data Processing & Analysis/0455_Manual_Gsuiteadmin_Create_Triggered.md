### Explain
This n8n workflow automates user management in G Suite by creating, updating, and retrieving user information. It starts with a manual trigger, adds a user with specified details, updates their last name, and finally retrieves the updated user data.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline employee onboarding. Instead of manually creating and updating user accounts in G Suite, they can automate the process, saving time and reducing errors, especially when hiring multiple employees.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **G Suite Admin** node to create a user with parameters (first name, last name, username, password).
4. Add a **G Suite Admin (update)** node to modify the user's last name.
5. Finally, include a **G Suite Admin (get)** node to retrieve and display the user's info.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that adds a user to a different platform (like Microsoft 365) using their API. Experiment with updating and retrieving user data to see how it differs from the G Suite process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automation services for user management, appealing to businesses looking to improve efficiency and reduce manual tasks. This can help you attract clients, generate income, and position yourself as a go-to automation expert.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "G Suite Admin2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
