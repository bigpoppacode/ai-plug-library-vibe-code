### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger and reads an RSS feed from a specified URL. It automates the process of fetching and potentially processing the latest content from that feed, making it easier to stay updated.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically pull in the latest blog posts or news articles from their industry’s RSS feed. This allows them to curate content for their website or newsletter without manual effort, saving time and ensuring fresh content.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **RSS Feed Read** node.
4. Set the URL parameter to your desired RSS feed link.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to fetch the latest feed content.

### Practice
Modify the RSS Feed Read node to use a different RSS feed URL. Execute the workflow and check the output to see the latest articles or posts fetched from the new feed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content curation for businesses, saving them time and enhancing their marketing efforts. This skill can help you attract clients looking to streamline their information gathering and keep their content fresh, potentially leading to increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
