## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the creation of a contact in Drift when triggered manually. It starts with a manual execution and then sends data to Drift to create a new contact, streamlining the process of adding leads.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to quickly add leads from a webinar signup to Drift, enhancing their customer engagement by ensuring all new contacts are promptly added to their communication platform.

2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Drift node** to create a contact.
4. Map the required fields (like email) in the Drift node.
5. Execute the workflow to test adding a contact.

**Practice:** Experiment by modifying the email field in the Drift node to add different test contacts. Run the workflow multiple times to see how it behaves with different inputs.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
