### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of receiving notifications when a new customer is created in HelpScout. It uses a webhook trigger to initiate actions whenever a new customer is registered, streamlining customer management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically notify their sales or support team whenever a new customer signs up, ensuring timely follow-ups and enhancing customer engagement without manual tracking.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **HelpScout Trigger** node and connect it to your HelpScout account.
3. Configure the trigger for the "customer.created" event.
4. Add an action node (e.g., send an email) to notify your team.
5. Save and activate the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send a Slack message instead of an email. This will help you understand how to customize notifications based on your team's communication preferences.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate customer notifications, saving time and improving response rates. This skill can attract clients looking for efficiency in customer management, increasing your income potential as an automation consultant.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
