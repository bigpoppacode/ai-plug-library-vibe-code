### Explain
This n8n workflow automates daily birthday reminders by fetching contacts from Google, filtering for today's birthdays, and sending notifications to a Slack channel. It ensures you never miss a birthday reminder, streamlining personal or team celebrations.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate birthday reminders for employees or clients, enhancing team morale and personal connections without manual tracking, saving time and effort each day.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily.
3. Use the **Google Contacts** node to fetch contacts with birthdays.
4. Add an **If** node to filter contacts with today's birthdays.
5. Set up a **Slack** node to send the birthday reminder.
6. Optionally, add **Sticky Notes** for workflow documentation.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the workflow to send reminders via email instead of Slack. Test it with a few dummy contacts added to your Google Contacts to see how it operates and adjust the notification method.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you create valuable automation services for clients, enhancing their customer engagement and operational efficiency, potentially generating income through consulting or service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
