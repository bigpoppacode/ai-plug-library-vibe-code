### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Add a "Bannerbear" node and configure it with your template ID.
4. Set the modifications for the text, color, and background.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to generate an image.

### Practice
Try modifying the text and colors in the "Bannerbear" node to see how different inputs affect the output. Execute the workflow multiple times to generate various designs and learn about the customization options.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
