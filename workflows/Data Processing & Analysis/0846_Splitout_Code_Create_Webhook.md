## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of term dates from an Excel file, processes the data using AI for event extraction, creates an ICS calendar file, and sends it via email. It transforms manual data handling into an efficient automated process.

### Demonstrate
A university administrator could use this workflow to automate the collection of academic term dates from a website, generate a calendar file, and email it to students, saving time and ensuring everyone has the correct dates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the "Get Term Dates Excel" node with the correct URL for your Excel file.
3. Set up the email node with your email address.
4. Test the workflow and adjust as needed to ensure it extracts the correct dates and sends the email successfully.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to pull term dates from a different Excel file or change the email recipient. Execute the workflow to see if it functions correctly with your adjustments.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, saving them time and errors in data handling. This skill can differentiate you in the market, leading to increased demand for your automation expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
