## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting product prices from specified web pages, checks for price changes, and notifies users of better deals or errors in price retrieval.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor competitor product prices. If a competitor drops their price, the owner gets notified instantly, allowing them to adjust their pricing strategy or run promotions effectively.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Customize the `initItem` node with product links, CSS selectors, and currency.
3. Set the Cron node for how often to check prices (e.g., every 15 minutes).
4. Test by running the workflow and reviewing email notifications for price changes.

### Practice
Create a new workflow that checks the price of a different product from a site of your choice. Adjust the CSS selector and observe how the workflow processes the new data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable price monitoring services to businesses, enabling them to stay competitive and responsive in their pricing strategies, ultimately increasing sales and customer satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTML Extract" and "NotifyIncorrectPrice" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
