### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management between Asana and Notion. It checks if a task needs to be created or updated in Notion based on changes in Asana, ensuring both platforms are synchronized without manual input.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically update their project management tools. For example, when a team member updates a task in Asana, this workflow can ensure that the corresponding task in Notion reflects that change, keeping everyone informed.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and connect to your Asana and Notion accounts.
2. Create a new workflow and add a Webhook trigger for Asana task updates.
3. Use an If node to check if a task should be created or updated.
4. Add Notion nodes to create or update tasks based on the Asana trigger.
5. Test the workflow by updating a task in Asana and observing changes in Notion.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include an additional step that sends a Slack notification whenever a task is created or updated. This will help reinforce how data flows through the workflow and how to add custom notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide valuable automation services, enhancing productivity for clients. By integrating Asana and Notion, you can attract customers seeking efficient project management solutions, leading to potential income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Determine create/update" and "On update" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
