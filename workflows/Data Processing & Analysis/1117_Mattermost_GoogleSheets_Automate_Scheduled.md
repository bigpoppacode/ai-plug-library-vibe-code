## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically collects data from Google Sheets and sends a notification via Mattermost at a scheduled time. It helps streamline communication by informing team members about specific sessions and gathering feedback.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to remind team members about upcoming sessions and collect feedback. For example, after a training session, it can send a message to the team asking for their thoughts, enhancing engagement and improving future sessions.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to schedule when messages should be sent.
2. Add a Google Sheets node to pull session data (like session name and feedback form link).
3. Connect a Mattermost node to send a message containing session details and a feedback prompt to a specific channel.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send messages at different times or to different Mattermost channels. Experiment with changing the data in Google Sheets to see how it alters the notifications sent.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate communication tasks, saving time and enhancing team collaboration. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, ultimately creating income opportunities in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Mattermost" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
