# Manual OpenWeatherMap Import Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, openWeatherMap.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenWeatherMap (openWeatherMap)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves current weather data for a specified city (e.g., Berlin) when triggered manually. It uses OpenWeatherMap's API to fetch and process weather information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate daily weather updates for their team, ensuring everyone knows the forecast before heading to work, improving planning and productivity.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Add the OpenWeatherMap node and configure it with your API key and desired city.
4. Connect the nodes and save the workflow.
5. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Modify the workflow to fetch weather data for a different city. Experiment with adding a notification node (like Slack) to send the weather report automatically after fetching it.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate information retrieval, saving time and increasing efficiency. This skill can attract clients needing custom automations, leading to potential income through service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "OpenWeatherMap" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
