# Manual Filter Automate Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8n, filter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Auto Resume Workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Find Deactivated Workflows (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Activate Workflow (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of finding and reactivating deactivated workflows in n8n. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves workflows tagged for auto-resumption, filters out deactivated ones, and finally activates them, ensuring efficient workflow management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically reactivate workflows that were paused due to errors or updates, ensuring that critical processes remain operational without manual oversight, saving time and reducing downtime.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Insert a **Get Auto Resume Workflows** node to retrieve workflows with the specific tag.
4. Use a **Filter** node to identify deactivated workflows.
5. Add an **Activate Workflow** node to reactivate the filtered workflows.
6. Save and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the existing workflow to include a notification step (like sending a Slack message) after a workflow has been reactivated. This way, you can confirm which workflows were successfully activated.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services, helping clients maintain operational efficiency. By ensuring their workflows are always active, you can enhance their productivity and potentially increase your service fees, creating a steady income stream.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Activate Workflow" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
