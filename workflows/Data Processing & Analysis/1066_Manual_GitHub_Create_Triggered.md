3. **Step 2: Github (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving a GitHub profile when manually triggered. It connects to GitHub, fetches user data, and can be expanded for further actions like notifications or data storage.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly access team member profiles from GitHub for onboarding or project management, saving time by automating data retrieval whenever needed.

### Imitate
1. **Create a New Workflow**: Start in n8n with a new manual trigger node.
2. **Add GitHub Node**: Configure it to access your GitHub profile or repository.
3. **Set Parameters**: Input your GitHub username and select the operation (e.g., `getProfile`).
4. **Connect Nodes**: Link the manual trigger to the GitHub node.
5. **Execute**: Run the workflow to see the output.

### Practice
Try modifying the GitHub node to fetch a different operation, like `getRepo`, to see how it changes the output. Experiment with different parameters and observe the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline data retrieval from GitHub, enhancing efficiency in team management and project tracking. This skill can be marketed to potential clients as a valuable automation service, generating income through consulting or workflow creation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Github" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
