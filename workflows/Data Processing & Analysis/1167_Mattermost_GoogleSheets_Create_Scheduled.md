# Mattermost GoogleSheets Create Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving mattermost, function, googleSheets.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Send message** node.
2. **Step 1: Send message (mattermost)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Check if new data (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Read data (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Execute every 45 mins (interval)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks a Google Sheet every 45 minutes for new entries. If new data is found, it sends a message via Mattermost with the details of the new entry (ID, Name, Email).

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to get instant notifications when new customer leads are added to their Google Sheet, allowing for timely follow-ups and improved customer engagement.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to execute every 45 minutes.
3. Use the **Google Sheets** node to read data from your sheet.
4. Add a **Function Node** to check for new entries and prepare the message.
5. Connect a **Mattermost** node to send the message with new entry details.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to check for new entries every 30 minutes and change the message format to include additional fields like "Phone Number" or "Address" if available in your Google Sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate lead notifications, enhancing your responsiveness to potential customers, which can lead to higher conversion rates and more business opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Send message" and "Execute every 45 mins" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
