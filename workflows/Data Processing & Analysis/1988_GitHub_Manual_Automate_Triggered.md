# Github Manual Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Globals (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Workflow name already exists (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: If workflow already exists (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set n8n existing workflows names (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: GitHub - get all files (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: n8n - get all workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: GitHub - get each file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Set name and content (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: n8n - create workflow (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Merge globals and files (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Merge Github and n8n workflows - Keep only non existing workflows based on the name (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the restoration of workflows from GitHub to n8n. When executed, it checks for existing workflows, retrieves files from a specified GitHub repository, and creates new workflows in n8n, avoiding duplicates.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly restore their automated processes after migrating to a new n8n instance, ensuring minimal downtime and continuity in operations by pulling all workflows from a backup repository.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** to start the process.
3. Use a **Set Node** to define GitHub repository details (owner, name, path).
4. Add the **GitHub Node** to fetch all files in the specified path.
5. Use an **If Node** to check for existing workflows in n8n.
6. If a workflow doesn’t exist, add a **Create Workflow Node** to restore it.
7. Execute the workflow and monitor the output for success.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the repository path or adding a new workflow to see how it behaves. Test it with a GitHub repository that contains simple workflows to understand how the restoration process works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline workflow management, offering a valuable service to clients needing to maintain or restore their automation processes. This expertise can lead to increased customer trust, retention, and potentially higher income as a service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
