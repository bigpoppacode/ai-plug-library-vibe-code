# Manual Crypto Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, crypto.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Crypto (crypto)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a simple process: when a manual trigger is activated, it performs a crypto operation (like hashing a message). It simplifies repetitive tasks and saves time by automating data handling without requiring coding skills.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to securely hash sensitive customer data (like passwords) whenever a new user registers. This ensures data security while saving time on manual hashing processes.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Crypto** node and set it to hash a sample message (e.g., "Hello World").
4. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the hashed output.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to hash different messages or switch to a different crypto operation (like HMAC). See how the output changes with various inputs to reinforce your understanding of the Crypto node.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate secure data processing tasks, enhancing your value as a consultant or developer. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient, secure solutions, ultimately leading to increased income opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Crypto" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
