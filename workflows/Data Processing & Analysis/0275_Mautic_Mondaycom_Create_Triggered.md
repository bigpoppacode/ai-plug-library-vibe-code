## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a new item in Monday.com when a new contact is added in Mautic. It captures the contact's first and last name, as well as their email, and adds this information to a specified board.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline lead management. When a new lead fills out a form on their website, this workflow automatically creates a corresponding entry in their project management tool (Monday.com), ensuring no leads are missed.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Mautic Trigger** to listen for new contacts.
3. Add a **Create Item** node for Monday.com to create an item with the contact's name and email.
4. Connect the nodes and configure parameters (e.g., board ID, column values).
5. Test the workflow by adding a new contact in Mautic.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional fields (like phone number or address) when creating an item in Monday.com. Experiment with different data inputs to see how it affects the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate lead management, saving time and reducing manual entry errors. This skill can help you attract clients needing automation solutions, offering significant value to their operations and increasing your income potential as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Create item" and "Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
