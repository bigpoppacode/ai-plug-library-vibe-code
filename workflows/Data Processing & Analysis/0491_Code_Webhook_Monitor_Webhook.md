## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow allows users to dynamically replace images in Google Slides presentations by sending a POST request to a webhook. It checks for necessary parameters, retrieves existing slide elements, and updates the specified images based on their unique identifiers.

### Demonstrate
A marketing agency could use this workflow to automatically update client presentation decks with the latest logos or images. This saves time and ensures presentations are always up-to-date without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a Webhook node to receive POST requests.
3. Use an IF node to check for required parameters (presentation_id, image_key, image_url).
4. Add HTTP Request nodes to retrieve slide elements and replace images based on the provided identifiers.
5. Configure response nodes to confirm updates.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only updates one image in a Google Slides presentation. Test it by sending a POST request with the required parameters using an API testing tool like Postman.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate client deliverables, allowing you to provide high-value services efficiently. This can attract more clients and increase your income by offering automation solutions that save time and improve accuracy.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Replace Images" and "Check if all params are provided" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
