# Splitout Code Automate Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, convertToFile, splitOut.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Convert to File (convertToFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: If (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Code (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the redesign of T-shirts using AI. It starts with a mockup image, sends it to an AI for analysis, generates a new design prompt, and returns an enhanced design, streamlining the creative process.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to quickly generate improved T-shirt designs based on client mockups. Instead of manually redesigning, they can automate the process, saving time and enhancing creativity.

### Imitate
1. Set up an HTTP Request node to receive a mockup image.
2. Use a Convert to File node to process the image.
3. Split Out the image data for analysis.
4. Integrate an AI Agent node to generate a redesign prompt.
5. Connect to OpenAI to analyze and refine the design.
6. Use a chat trigger to receive feedback on the generated design.
7. Implement an If node to handle conditional responses.
8. Code any necessary transformations.
9. Output the final design to a Sticky Note or another node for review.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the image source or the AI model used for analysis. Test with different mockup images to see how variations affect the redesign outcome.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer T-shirt design services enhanced by AI, increasing your value proposition to clients. It can lead to higher profits, attract more customers, and position you as a leader in creative automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTTP Request" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
