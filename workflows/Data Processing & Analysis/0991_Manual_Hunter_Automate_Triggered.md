### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the email verification process. When triggered, it takes an email address, checks its validity using Hunter's API, and updates the record in Airtable. This helps maintain clean email lists for businesses.

### Demonstrate
A marketing consultant could use this workflow to regularly verify leads’ email addresses in their Airtable CRM, ensuring high deliverability rates for email campaigns and reducing bounce rates, ultimately increasing customer engagement.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a **Manual Trigger** to start the process.
3. Add a **Hunter Node** to verify emails (connect your Hunter API).
4. Add a **Set Node** to format the response as needed.
5. Finally, connect an **Airtable Node** to update the email status.

### Practice
Try importing the workflow and testing it with a few email addresses. Modify the email address in the Airtable record to see how the workflow updates the status after verification with Hunter.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable email verification services to clients, enhancing their marketing efforts and improving deliverability rates. This skill can lead to higher client satisfaction and potential income as part of an automation consultancy.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
