# Code Postgres Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving postgresTrigger, filter, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Postgres Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Postgres Trigger (postgresTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Filter (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: On clicking "Execute Node" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Code (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Google Sheets (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of syncing data from a PostgreSQL database to Google Sheets. It triggers when user data is updated, filters out specific email addresses, and saves qualified leads into the spreadsheet.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically update their sales leads in Google Sheets whenever a user’s information changes in their PostgreSQL database. This saves time and ensures data accuracy.

### Imitate
1. Set up a PostgreSQL database with user data.
2. Create a n8n workflow with a PostgreSQL Trigger.
3. Add a Filter node to exclude unwanted emails.
4. Use Google Sheets node to append qualified leads.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it functions as expected.

### Practice
Experiment by adding a new user in your PostgreSQL database and updating their information. Check if the workflow correctly triggers and updates the Google Sheets with the new data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data management tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy. This skill can attract customers looking for automation solutions, helping you generate income in the AI automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Postgres Trigger" and "Google Sheets" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
