### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending weather updates via SMS. It uses a scheduled trigger to check the weather in Berlin daily, then sends a text message with the current temperature using Plivo.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to send daily weather updates to employees or customers. For instance, a local delivery service could inform drivers about the weather conditions to prepare them for their routes.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron node** to trigger daily at a chosen time.
3. Connect an **OpenWeatherMap node** to fetch weather data for your city.
4. Add a **Plivo node** to send an SMS with the temperature.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends the message correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch weather data for a different city. Change the city name in the OpenWeatherMap node and observe how the SMS content updates accordingly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate essential communications, improving efficiency and customer engagement. It positions you to offer valuable automation services, potentially generating income as you help businesses streamline their processes.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Plivo" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
