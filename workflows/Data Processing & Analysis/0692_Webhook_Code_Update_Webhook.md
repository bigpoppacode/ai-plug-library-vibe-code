## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the applicant review process. It collects applications via a webhook, checks if resumes are attached, evaluates applicants using AI, and updates their status in ERPNext based on the evaluation outcome.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline hiring. Instead of manually reviewing resumes, it quickly processes applications, evaluates candidates, and updates their status, saving time and ensuring consistency in hiring decisions.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow with a webhook to collect application data.
2. Add a node to check if a resume is attached.
3. Use an AI node to evaluate the application against job criteria.
4. Update the applicant's status in your chosen system (e.g., ERPNext).

### Practice
Set up a simplified version of this workflow. Use a mock application form to submit data, then simulate the AI evaluation with static responses, updating a Google Sheet instead of ERPNext to visualize outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you provide valuable automation services to clients, enhancing their recruitment efficiency. As a consultant, you can offer this as a high-demand service, generating income while saving clients time and resources.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note4" and "WhatsApp Business Cloud" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
