# Code Readpdf Send Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving readPDF, stickyNote, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On email received** node.
2. **Step 1: Read PDF (readPDF)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Configure (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Is PDF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Not a PDF (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Is matched (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: This is a matched PDF (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: This is not a matched PDF (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Iterate over email attachments (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: OpenAI matches PDF textual content (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Upload file to folder (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of receiving email attachments, specifically PDFs, analyzing their content with OpenAI, and then organizing the relevant files into a Google Drive folder based on predefined criteria.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically sort and store invoices received via email. Instead of manually checking attachments, the workflow saves time and ensures important documents are organized for easy access.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Gmail Trigger to detect incoming emails.
3. Use a code node to iterate over attachments.
4. Add a readPDF node to extract text from PDFs.
5. Configure an OpenAI node to analyze the content.
6. Use conditional nodes to check if the content matches your criteria.
7. Upload matched PDFs to a specified Google Drive folder.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to match a different keyword, like "receipt" instead of "invoice." Test it by sending yourself an email with PDF attachments that contain the new keyword and verify that they are correctly uploaded to Google Drive.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate tedious tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy in document management. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, creating opportunities for income in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Read PDF" and "There are no attachments" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
