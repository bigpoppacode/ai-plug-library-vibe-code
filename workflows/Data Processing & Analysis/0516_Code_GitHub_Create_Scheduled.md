10. **Step 9: Same file - Do nothing (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: File is different (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: File is new (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Create new file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Edit existing file (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Get file data (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Globals (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Execute Command (executeCommand)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
22. **Step 21: JSON formatting (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
23. **Step 22: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up instance credentials to GitHub. It triggers manually, retrieves files, checks for changes, and updates or creates new files as necessary, ensuring efficient data management and storage.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically back up critical configuration files to GitHub. This ensures data security and version control, providing peace of mind and easy recovery in case of data loss.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use **HTTP Request** to get your file from a source.
4. Implement an **If** node to check if the file is large.
5. Use a **Merge** node to combine data.
6. Add a **Code** node to determine if the file is different or new.
7. Set **Switch** nodes to handle different outcomes (same, different, new).
8. Use **GitHub** nodes to create or edit files based on the checks.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to back up a different type of data, such as customer information or project files. Test it by changing the source file and observing how the workflow reacts to the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services that ensure data security and efficiency for clients, making your business more attractive and potentially increasing your revenue through repeat contracts and higher-value projects.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Execute Workflow Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
