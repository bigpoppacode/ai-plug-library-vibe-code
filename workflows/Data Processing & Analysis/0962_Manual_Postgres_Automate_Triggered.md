# Manual Postgres Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, postgres.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Postgres (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger that executes a query on a PostgreSQL database, retrieving data from a specified table. It's useful for automating data retrieval tasks without needing coding skills.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly fetch customer records from a database upon request, enabling them to analyze or present data without manual querying, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Drag in a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Postgres** node and configure it with your database credentials.
4. Set the operation to "executeQuery" and input your SQL query (e.g., `SELECT * from your_table;`).
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see results.

### Practice
Try modifying the SQL query in the Postgres node to filter results (e.g., `SELECT * from your_table WHERE condition;`) and execute the workflow to see how it changes the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate data retrieval tasks, enhancing your efficiency and allowing you to offer valuable automation services to clients, potentially generating income through consulting or service packages.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Postgres" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
