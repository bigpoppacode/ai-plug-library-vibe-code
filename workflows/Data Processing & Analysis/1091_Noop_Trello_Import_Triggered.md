## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting product feedback through Typeform, storing it in Airtable, evaluating the score, and sending the feedback to Trello for further action. It ensures efficient data handling and improves response time.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to gather customer feedback after a product launch. Instead of manually collecting and analyzing feedback, the workflow automates data entry and prioritization, allowing them to focus on product improvements.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform for customer feedback.
2. Create an n8n workflow with a Typeform Trigger.
3. Add a Set node to structure the data.
4. Connect to Airtable to log the feedback.
5. Use an IF node to filter scores before sending to Trello.
6. Test the workflow by submitting feedback via Typeform.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that collects feedback from a different source (like Google Forms). Modify the nodes to adapt to the new source and see how the workflow changes with different data structures.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline customer feedback processes, saving time and improving data accuracy. This skill can attract clients needing automation solutions, ultimately generating income and enhancing your service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Typeform Trigger" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
