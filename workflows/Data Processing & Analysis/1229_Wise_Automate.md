## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a currency transfer using the Wise API. It first generates a quote, then creates and executes a transfer based on that quote, ensuring funds are moved efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate international payments for suppliers, eliminating manual steps, reducing errors, and saving time in financial operations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure your Wise API credentials.
3. Adjust the parameters (amount, currencies, account IDs).
4. Test by executing the workflow to see the automated transfer in action.

### Practice
Try modifying the amount or currency parameters in the workflow. Run it with different values to see how it affects the quote and transfer process, ensuring you understand each step's output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you streamline financial operations, attract clients seeking automation in international payments, and potentially increase your income by offering these services to businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Wise" and "Wise3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
