## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the monitoring of Amazon product prices. It fetches product data from Google Sheets, scrapes the current prices from Amazon, compares them with previous prices, logs changes, and alerts users via email if significant price fluctuations occur.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to track prices of products they sell on Amazon, ensuring they adjust their prices competitively. If a product price drops significantly, they get an email alert, allowing them to act quickly and potentially increase sales.

### Imitate
1. Create a Google Sheet with product ASINs and alert thresholds.
2. Set up the n8n workflow using a Schedule Trigger to run hourly.
3. Configure the HTTP Request node to fetch product data from Amazon.
4. Add logic to compare prices and set alerts.
5. Test the workflow by changing product prices in the Google Sheet.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional products or different alert thresholds. Experiment with the frequency of checks (e.g., daily instead of hourly) and see how it affects the alerts you receive.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide valuable automation services to businesses, making their price monitoring more efficient. This can lead to recurring income streams by offering tailored solutions that save time and increase profitability.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Products to Monitor" and "Schedule Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
