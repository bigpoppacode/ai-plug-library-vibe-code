## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering your team's tickets daily at 06:00, fetching data from a GraphQL API, processing the tickets, and writing them to Google Sheets for easy tracking and management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically compile and analyze team tickets every morning, helping identify issues, prioritize tasks, and improve team productivity without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** for your desired time.
2. Use a **GraphQL Node** to fetch tickets, adjusting the query as needed.
3. Add **Set Nodes** to process ticket data.
4. Use **Google Sheets Node** to write data into a specified sheet.
5. Test and activate your workflow.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that collects daily sales data from a different API and logs it into Google Sheets. Adjust the data fields to match your specific needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to save time and reduce manual errors in ticket management, making your business operations more efficient. This skill can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, enhancing your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Every day at 06:00" and "Flatten object to have simple fields to filter by" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
