### Explain
This n8n workflow sends daily weather updates to a specified audience via push notifications. It starts with a scheduled trigger at 9 AM, retrieves the weather data for Berlin, and then sends a notification with the temperature.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to keep their team informed about daily weather conditions, helping them plan activities or events better—especially useful for outdoor or logistics-related businesses.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron Trigger** to fire at 9 AM.
3. Insert an **OpenWeatherMap Node** to fetch weather for your city.
4. Add a **Spontit Node** to send a notification with the weather data.
5. Customize the notification content and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the city in the OpenWeatherMap node to see how the workflow adapts. Change the notification message format to include more details like humidity or wind speed to understand data manipulation.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
