## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching Google search results (SERPs) for specified keywords, filtering out empty titles, and organizing the results for SEO analysis.

### Demonstrate
A digital marketing agency could use this workflow to track keyword rankings for clients, helping them optimize their SEO strategies by analyzing SERP data without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Start a new n8n workflow with a Manual Trigger node.
2. Set Keywords to get SERPs for (use an array of keywords).
3. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch SERP results from Scraping Robot.
4. Use the Set node to structure the results.
5. Filter out any empty titles and assign rankings.
6. Store results in a database or send via email.

### Practice
Try modifying the keywords in the "Set Keywords to get SERPs for" node and execute the workflow. Observe how the results change based on different keywords.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable SEO analysis services, attracting clients who need to improve their online visibility and allowing you to generate income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note18" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
