### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving a company's logo, icon, and information from Brandfetch and storing it in Airtable. It starts when you manually execute it and flows through steps to gather data and save it.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically collect and store brand assets for multiple clients. For example, an agency could run it to quickly gather logos and icons for a marketing presentation, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Include a **Brandfetch** node to fetch company data (set the domain).
4. Add another **Brandfetch** node to get specific company info.
5. Use a **Set** node to format the data for Airtable.
6. Add an **Airtable** node to store the data.
7. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to fetch and store details of another company or a different type of asset (like social media links) using the same Brandfetch and Airtable nodes. Experiment with modifying the fields that are saved.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer valuable automation services, helping businesses streamline their branding processes. This can lead to cost savings, increased efficiency, and a potential source of income through service offerings or consultations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Airtable" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
