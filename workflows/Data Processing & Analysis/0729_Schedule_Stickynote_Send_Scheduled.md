## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors system resources (CPU, RAM, Disk) every 15 minutes. If any resource usage exceeds 80%, it sends an email alert with the resource status.

### Demonstrate
A web hosting company can use this workflow to ensure server health. If resource usage spikes, they get notified immediately, allowing them to take action before performance issues arise.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Schedule Trigger to run every 15 minutes.
3. Use SSH nodes to check CPU, RAM, and Disk usage.
4. Merge results and check if any exceed 80%.
5. Set up an Email node to alert you if thresholds are exceeded.

### Practice
Set up the workflow and adjust the threshold from 80% to 70%. Simulate high resource usage on your server to see if you receive the email notification correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to proactively manage server health, reducing downtime and improving client satisfaction, which can lead to more business opportunities and higher retention rates.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Send Email" and "Schedule Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
