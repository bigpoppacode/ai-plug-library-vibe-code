## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking an RSS feed for new releases, filtering them by the current day, and sending notifications via Telegram and email if there are any new updates. It allows users to stay informed without manual checks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically notify their team on Telegram and by email whenever a new product release is posted on a competitor's RSS feed, ensuring they stay competitive without constant monitoring.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your RSS feed URL in the "RSS Feed Read" node.
3. Modify the filter conditions in the "Filter by current day" function to suit your needs.
4. Update the Telegram and AWS SES nodes with your credentials.
5. Execute the workflow manually or set a Cron trigger to run it periodically.

### Practice
Create a new RSS feed workflow to monitor a blog of your choice. Set it up to send you a daily summary of new posts via email. Experiment with changing the filter criteria to see how it affects the notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate routine updates, saving time and improving responsiveness. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions, helping you grow your AI automation business and generate income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
