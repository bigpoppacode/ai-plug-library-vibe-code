14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: OpenAI Chat Model Classifier (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Text Classifier - Chart required? (textClassifier)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: User question + Agent initial response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Information Extractor - User question (informationExtractor)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of responding to user queries about data, integrating an AI agent for SQL database querying and generating visual charts when needed. It streamlines data analysis and visualization, making it easier for users to understand insights.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically respond to customer inquiries about sales data. When a customer asks about trends, the workflow fetches data from the database and generates a chart, providing a quick and visual answer.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "When chat message received" node to trigger on user input.
3. Connect an "AI Agent" node to interpret the user’s question.
4. Use a "Text Classifier" to determine if a chart is needed.
5. If yes, add the "OpenAI - Generate Chart" node to create a chart based on SQL data.
6. Finally, use a "Set response" node to send the answer (and chart) back to the user.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to use a different dataset or chart type. Change the SQL query in the "AI Agent" node and see how the chart output changes in response to different user questions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable data insights to clients, enhancing their decision-making and presentation capabilities. This skill can attract more customers, leading to increased income as part of your AI automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "OpenAI Chat Model" and "Information Extractor - User question" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
