## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the retrieval of Scaleway server information based on user-defined search criteria. It collects data from the Scaleway API, processes it, and allows filtering by tags, names, public IPs, or zones before returning the results via a webhook.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly fetch and filter server information for cloud resource management. For example, a tech consultant might need to identify all servers with specific tags to optimize resource allocation for a client.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install and open n8n.
2. **Add Webhook Node**: Create a Webhook node to trigger the workflow.
3. **Configure Scaleway API Calls**: Add HTTP Request nodes to fetch server details.
4. **Implement Filtering Logic**: Use a Switch node to filter results based on user input.
5. **Respond to Webhook**: Add Respond nodes to return the filtered server data.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that retrieves data from a public API (like a weather API) and filters results based on user input. Experiment with different filtering criteria to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate cloud management tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract clients who need efficient resource management solutions, ultimately generating income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Code" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
