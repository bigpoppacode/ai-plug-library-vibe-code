## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates code reviews by integrating GitHub and OpenAI. When a pull request (PR) is made, it retrieves code diffs, generates a review prompt for OpenAI, and posts feedback as a comment on the PR, enhancing collaboration and efficiency.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to automate code reviews. Instead of manually reviewing each PR, the workflow leverages AI to provide instant feedback, saving time and ensuring consistent quality in code assessments.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a GitHub trigger for PR events.
3. Configure the HTTP request to fetch file diffs.
4. Create a JavaScript function to format the diffs into a prompt for OpenAI.
5. Post the AI-generated feedback back to the PR and label it as "ReviewedByAI."

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send AI feedback to a Slack channel instead of posting it on GitHub. This will help you understand how to adapt workflows for different communication tools.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated code review services, increasing your value as a developer or consultant. You can save clients time and improve code quality, creating opportunities for high-ticket automation services in software development.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "OpenAI Chat Model" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
