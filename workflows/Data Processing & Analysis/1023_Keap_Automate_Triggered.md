## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving keapTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Keap Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Keap Trigger (keapTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow uses a Keap trigger to automate actions when a new contact is added. It listens for new contacts in Keap and can connect with other nodes to perform tasks automatically, such as sending emails or updating records.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically send a welcome email to new clients in their CRM (Keap). This saves time and ensures consistent communication, enhancing customer experience.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Keap Trigger** node to listen for new contacts.
3. Connect an **Email** node to send a welcome message.
4. Test the workflow by adding a new contact in Keap.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to add a follow-up action after sending the welcome email, such as adding the contact to a mailing list or sending a thank-you message a week later.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate repetitive tasks, improve client communication, and streamline operations, ultimately increasing your value as a consultant or developer in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Keap Trigger" and "Keap Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
