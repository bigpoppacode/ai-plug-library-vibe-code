## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates daily task management by fetching today's calendar events, filtering out recurring tasks, and creating Trello cards for each event, ensuring tasks are organized and actionable.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline their daily operations. For example, instead of manually checking their Google Calendar and creating Trello cards for each meeting, this automation saves time and ensures nothing is overlooked.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up**: Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. **Add Trigger**: Use the Cron node to trigger daily at 8 AM.
3. **Get Events**: Connect Google Calendar to fetch today's events.
4. **Filter Tasks**: Add an If node to remove recurring tasks.
5. **Create Trello Cards**: Set up Trello nodes to create cards for each event.
6. **Test**: Run the workflow to ensure it captures and organizes tasks correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only fetches events from Google Calendar and logs them to a Google Sheet instead of creating Trello cards. This will help you understand data flow and filtering.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you save time, enhance productivity, and offer automation services to clients, potentially leading to new business opportunities and increased income as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get Start & End of day" and "Trigger Every Day at 8am" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
