## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the handling of payment webhooks from Ko-fi, checking verification tokens and categorizing payments (donations, subscriptions, or shop orders) for further processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner using Ko-fi for donations can use this workflow to automatically handle incoming payments, ensuring they capture donor details and categorize payments without manual intervention, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Webhook node to receive Ko-fi payments.
3. Set up a Stop and Error node for invalid tokens.
4. Use Set nodes to assign payment details (donations, subscriptions, shop orders).
5. Implement If and Switch nodes to categorize payments.
6. Add Sticky Note nodes for notes and instructions.
7. Test and deploy the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the webhook URL and verification token in the Prepare node, then simulate a Ko-fi payment to see how the workflow processes it. Check the logs for errors and ensure it categorizes the payment correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline payment processing for clients using Ko-fi, leading to increased efficiency, reduced manual workload, and the potential to offer premium automation services, enhancing your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
