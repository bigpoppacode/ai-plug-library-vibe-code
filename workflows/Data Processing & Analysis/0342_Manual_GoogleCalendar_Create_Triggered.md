# Manual GoogleCalendar Create Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, googleCalendar.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Google Calendar (googleCalendar)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates adding an event to Google Calendar. When the user clicks 'execute', it triggers the workflow, which then inputs a specified event start and end time into a designated Google Calendar.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically schedule events like meetings or deadlines. For example, when a client submits a form, the workflow can add a follow-up meeting to the calendar without manual entry, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Google Calendar** node.
4. Configure the Google Calendar node with your calendar ID and event details (start/end times).
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to test.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow to add events with different details. Change the start and end times and add a description. Execute the workflow to see the updates in your Google Calendar.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to save time on scheduling, enhance productivity, and provide automated calendar management services for clients, creating value and potential income streams in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Google Calendar" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
