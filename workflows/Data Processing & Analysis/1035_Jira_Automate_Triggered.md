# Jira Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving jiraTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Jira Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Jira Trigger (jiraTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting customer feedback through a form, analyzing the sentiment using OpenAI's AI, and then storing both the feedback and sentiment in Google Sheets. It eliminates manual data handling, saving time and improving accuracy.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline customer feedback collection. For example, a restaurant could gather reviews via a form, automatically analyze sentiment (positive, neutral, negative), and log the results in a Google Sheet for tracking customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Create a form for customer feedback.
2. Set up a Webhook Trigger in n8n to capture form submissions.
3. Use the OpenAI node to analyze the sentiment of the feedback.
4. Connect a Google Sheets node to log the feedback and sentiment.
5. Test the workflow by submitting feedback and checking Google Sheets for results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding another field to the feedback form, such as "Urgency" or "Suggestions." Then, update the Google Sheets mapping to include this new data. Test it by submitting a new form entry and verifying that the data logs correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, saving them time and improving their customer insights. This can lead to new clients, recurring revenue, and enhanced service offerings, positioning you as a solution architect in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Jira Trigger" and "Jira Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
