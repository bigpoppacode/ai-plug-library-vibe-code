# Code Schedule Send Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving ftp, scheduleTrigger, mqtt.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: SFTP zip file content (ftp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: CRON Monday 2:45 am (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Send Zigbee2MQTT backup request (mqtt)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: MQTT Trigger - Backup Response (mqttTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Parse JSON Object from Message Text (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Convert to File - base64 to binary (convertToFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up Zigbee2MQTT data. It runs every Monday at 2:45 AM, requests a backup, processes the received data, converts it into a file, and uploads it to an SFTP server for storage.

### Demonstrate
A tech company could use this workflow to ensure regular backups of their IoT device configurations. Automating this process saves time and prevents data loss, ensuring the company can restore settings quickly if needed.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance.
2. Create a new workflow and add a Schedule Trigger node for your desired time.
3. Add an MQTT node to send a backup request.
4. Use an MQTT Trigger node to capture the backup response.
5. Add a Code node to parse the JSON response.
6. Use a Convert to File node to transform the data to binary.
7. Add an SFTP node to upload the file.

### Practice
Create a test version of this workflow. Use a mock MQTT broker to simulate sending and receiving messages. Test the workflow by sending a backup request and ensuring it processes the response correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate critical data management tasks, enhancing your service offerings. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, the ability to take on more projects, and potential income through automation consulting services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "SFTP zip file content" and "Convert to File - base64 to binary" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
