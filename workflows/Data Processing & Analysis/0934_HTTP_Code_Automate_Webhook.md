## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the conversion of newly uploaded PDF files in Google Drive to HTML format. It triggers when a PDF is added, checks the file type, sends a request to an API for conversion, saves the HTML file back to Google Drive, and manages data flow seamlessly.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to streamline the process of converting client PDFs into HTML for a website. Instead of manually converting files, the workflow automatically handles uploads, saving time and improving efficiency for digital asset management.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Drive Trigger to watch a specific folder.
2. Add an If node to check if the new file is a PDF.
3. Use an HTTP Request node to send the PDF to a conversion API.
4. Add a Google Drive node to save the converted HTML file.
5. Optionally, implement code to convert the output to a binary file if necessary.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that converts images to a different format (e.g., PNG to JPG). Set it to trigger when a new image is uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder, following the same steps as the PDF conversion workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors. As a consultant, you can offer such automation services, making your business more efficient and appealing to clients looking for innovative solutions to document handling.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Google Drive Trigger" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
