## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Window Buffer Memory** node.
2. **Step 1: Window Buffer Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Line: Get Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Message Type (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Message Classification (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Text Message Processing (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Image Message Processing (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Line: Response to User (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Line: Text Response to User (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Text from Slip Result (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Line: Messaging API (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Google Gemini for Text (lmChatGoogleGemini)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Google Gemini for Image (lmChatGoogleGemini)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of key information from pay slips sent as images or text messages. It uses AI to analyze the content, classifies the message type, and saves the results in Google Sheets for easy tracking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline payroll inquiries. Employees send their pay slips via a messaging app, and the automation extracts relevant data (like amount and date) and logs it in a spreadsheet, saving HR time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook trigger in n8n to receive messages.
2. Use the HTTP request node to fetch images.
3. Implement AI processing nodes to analyze text and images.
4. Use conditional nodes to classify messages (text or image).
5. Save results to Google Sheets for record-keeping.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow where you manually input a pay slip image and log the extracted information into a Google Sheet. Experiment with different formats and see how the AI responds to various inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, streamline their operations, and reduce manual data entry, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency in their businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Window Buffer Memory" and "Google Gemini for Image" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
