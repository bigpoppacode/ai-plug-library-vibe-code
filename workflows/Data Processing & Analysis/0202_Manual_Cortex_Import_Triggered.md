# Manual Cortex Import Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, cortex.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cortex (cortex)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Cortex1 (cortex)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the analysis of a URL by utilizing the Cortex node to check for potential abuse. It starts with a manual trigger, analyzes the URL, and retrieves job details from the Cortex API, streamlining the process of URL vetting.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to quickly assess the safety of URLs shared by clients or partners. For example, a marketing agency could automatically check links from their clients to ensure they don’t lead to malicious sites, protecting their reputation and users.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Cortex** node to analyze a specific URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).
4. Link a second **Cortex** node to retrieve job details using the job ID from the first Cortex node.
5. Test the workflow by executing it and checking the output.

### Practice
Try modifying the URL in the Cortex node to analyze different links. After running the workflow, document the results for at least three different URLs to see how the analysis varies and understand the output structure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer URL safety checks as a service, which is highly valuable for businesses concerned about cybersecurity. This skill can attract clients looking for automated solutions to enhance their online safety and reputation, potentially generating significant income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Cortex1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
