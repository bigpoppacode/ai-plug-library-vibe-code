# Manual Import Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow captures today's date and day of the week when manually triggered. It uses a Function node to generate the current date in ISO format and determines the corresponding weekday, storing both values for further use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate daily reports. For example, it can log the date and day in a Google Sheet every morning to track project milestones or deadlines, ensuring timely updates without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Function** node with the provided code to get the current date and day.
4. Connect the nodes.
5. Execute the workflow and check the output.

### Practice
Try modifying the Function node to also include the current time. Execute the workflow again and observe how the output changes to include time alongside the date and day.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate routine tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions, creating value and generating income for your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Function" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
