## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow verifies mailing addresses for new contacts in Keap. When a new contact is added, it checks if the address is valid, updates the contact's status in Keap, and uses a webhook to trigger the process.

### Demonstrate
A marketing consultant can use this workflow to ensure all new leads have accurate addresses, reducing bounce rates for mail campaigns and improving customer outreach efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook Trigger to capture new contacts.
3. Use the Set node to define address fields.
4. Add an HTTP Request node to verify addresses via a service like Lob.
5. Use a Switch node to update Keap based on deliverability.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send a notification via Slack or email if an address is found to be undeliverable, reinforcing your understanding of conditional logic in workflows.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services, improve client data accuracy, and create systems that save time and reduce costs, ultimately increasing your income potential as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Switch" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
