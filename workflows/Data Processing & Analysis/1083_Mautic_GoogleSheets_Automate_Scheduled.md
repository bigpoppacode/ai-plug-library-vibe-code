### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading data from Google Sheets every five minutes and sending that data to Mautic for email marketing. It helps streamline the data collection and communication process without manual input.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically add new leads from a Google Sheets document to their Mautic email marketing platform. This ensures timely communication with potential customers, enhancing lead engagement without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a "Cron" node to trigger every 5 minutes.
3. Add a "GS Read Data2" node to read data from your Google Sheets.
4. Add a "Mautic" node to send the data (e.g., email, first name) to your Mautic account.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data flows correctly.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that reads data from another source, like a CSV file or a different Google Sheet, and sends it to a different service (like Mailchimp). Experiment with different intervals and data fields to see how it impacts your workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate tedious tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract clients seeking efficiency, ultimately increasing your service offerings and income as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "GS Read Data2" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
