## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.

3. **Step 2: AWS SES (awsSes)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the sending of emails using AWS SES. When you click 'execute,' it triggers the AWS SES node to send a predefined email to specified recipients. It's a simple way to send emails automatically without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to send out weekly newsletters or promotional emails to customers. Instead of sending each email manually, they can execute this workflow to reach multiple recipients instantly, saving time and ensuring consistent communication.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **AWS SES** node.
4. Configure the AWS SES node with email details (subject, body, from, and to addresses).
5. Connect the Manual Trigger to the AWS SES node.
6. Save and execute the workflow to send the email.

### Practice
Try modifying the email content in the AWS SES node to personalize it. Change the subject and body to see how it affects the email you receive. Experiment with sending to different email addresses to test the workflow's flexibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate email communication, which can save significant time and reduce errors. This skill is valuable for building automation services for clients, enhancing your offerings, and increasing your income potential in the growing field of automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "AWS SES" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
