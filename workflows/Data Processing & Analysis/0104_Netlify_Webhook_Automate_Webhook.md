### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of receiving data via a webhook and creating a new site on Netlify based on that data. It allows users to trigger a site creation event simply by sending a POST request.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the creation of landing pages for marketing campaigns. When a new product is launched, they can send the product details through a webhook, which automatically generates a corresponding webpage on Netlify.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook trigger in n8n.
2. Configure the Netlify node with your site ID and desired page parameters.
3. Test the workflow by sending a POST request to the webhook URL with data for a new page.

### Practice
Try creating a simple form that sends data to your webhook. Use this data to create a test page on Netlify, experimenting with different titles or content to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer scalable web solutions to clients, streamline their marketing efforts, and potentially charge for each site created, enhancing your service offerings and income potential.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
