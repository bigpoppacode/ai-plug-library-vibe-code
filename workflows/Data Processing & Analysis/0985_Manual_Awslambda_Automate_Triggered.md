# Manual AWSLambda Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, awsLambda.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: AWS Lambda (awsLambda)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger, allowing users to execute it on demand. It then calls an AWS Lambda function, which can perform various tasks, such as processing data or integrating with other services.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to trigger a report generation via AWS Lambda when they need insights from their data, enabling quick decision-making without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Add an "AWS Lambda" node, configuring it to call your specific Lambda function.
4. Connect the nodes.
5. Test the workflow by executing it.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the AWS Lambda function to perform a simple task (e.g., returning a greeting). Trigger the workflow and observe the output to see how changes affect results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks and integrate with cloud services, enhancing your value proposition as a consultant or business owner, ultimately leading to increased efficiency and potential revenue growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "AWS Lambda" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
