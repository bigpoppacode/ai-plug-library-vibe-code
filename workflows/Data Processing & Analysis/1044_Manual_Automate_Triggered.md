# Manual Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Set1 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process that starts with a manual trigger, executes a function to generate IDs, evaluates conditions, and sets specific values based on those conditions. It helps streamline repetitive tasks by automating decision-making steps.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate customer segmentation. When a new customer is added, the workflow checks their ID and assigns them to either a "new" or "returning" customer category, allowing tailored marketing strategies to be implemented automatically.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node as the starting point.
3. Insert a **Function** node, writing code to return IDs.
4. Add an **IF** node to check conditions based on the ID.
5. Use **Set** nodes to define actions based on the conditions met.
6. Execute the workflow to see it in action.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that triggers with a manual click, generates two random numbers, checks if the first is greater than the second, and sets a message to display the result. Test it multiple times to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate routine tasks, enhance operational efficiency, and provide tailored customer experiences. As a result, you can attract more clients and generate income by offering automation solutions that save time and reduce errors.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
