## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of verifying and enriching email addresses from form submissions. It extracts the domain from the email, checks if it's from a free provider, enriches the account data, and sends the results back to the original source.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate lead qualification. When a potential customer submits their email through a web form, the system verifies the email, checks if it's from a professional source, enriches their data, and routes them to the appropriate sales team.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook to receive form submissions.
2. Use a "Get domain from email" node to extract the domain.
3. Implement a "Verify professional email" node to check if the email is from a free provider.
4. Add a "Qualify Account" node to classify leads based on company size or other criteria.
5. Use an "Enrich with Datagma" node to gather additional data about the lead.
6. Send the results back via the "Respond to Webhook" node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a step that sends a notification to your team whenever a lead is classified as high-value. This could involve adding a Slack or email node after the qualification step.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients, enhancing their lead qualification processes. By providing efficient, data-driven insights, you can help businesses save time and increase conversion rates, positioning yourself as a sought-after automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get domain from email" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
