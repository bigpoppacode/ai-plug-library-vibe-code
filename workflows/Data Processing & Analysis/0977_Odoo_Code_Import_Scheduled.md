## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of importing product images from Google Drive into an Odoo system. It filters image files, decorates them with relevant data, moves them to a designated folder, and updates product information in Odoo, ultimately notifying a team via Google Chat.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate product image updates for an online store. By streamlining image management, they save time and ensure that all product listings are visually consistent and up-to-date, enhancing customer experience.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Drive and Odoo accounts.
3. Adjust folder IDs and file conditions in the Filter Images step.
4. Set image decoration logic in the Decorate Images step.
5. Test the workflow to ensure images are moved and updated correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only filters and moves images from one Google Drive folder to another. Test it with a few sample images, then gradually add steps to integrate with Odoo.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate tedious image management tasks, freeing up your time for higher-value activities. This skill can help you attract clients looking for efficiency in their operations, leading to new business opportunities and income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Filter Images" and "Click Manual" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
