This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Note9 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Ingredients in stock from recipe (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Super Band (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: A. Ingredients Needed (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: B. Ingredients in stock (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Merge recipe (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: A. Ingredients (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: B. Recipe quantities (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging ingredient data from recipes and stock, enhancing efficiency in inventory management. It uses various nodes to trigger actions, process data, and merge relevant information for better decision-making.

### Demonstrate
A restaurant owner could use this workflow to manage kitchen inventory. When a new dish is added, it checks stock levels for required ingredients, ensuring they have everything on hand, reducing waste, and preventing last-minute shortages.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n:** Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. **Modify Ingredients:** Adjust the ingredient lists in the code nodes to fit your recipes.
3. **Test Execution:** Run the workflow to see how it merges stock information with recipes.
4. **Adjust Notes:** Update sticky notes to reflect your specific inventory management needs.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that only checks if key ingredients are in stock before allowing a new recipe to be added. Test it with different ingredient lists to see how it behaves.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline inventory management for businesses, saving time and reducing waste. This skill can attract clients looking for efficiency improvements, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "B. Led Zeppelin" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
