## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow collects customer feedback from a SurveyMonkey form and automatically analyzes the sentiment using OpenAI. The results, including the original feedback and sentiment analysis, are stored in a Google Sheet for easy review.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a SurveyMonkey account and create a feedback form.
3. Configure the SurveyMonkey Trigger with your form's ID.
4. Connect your OpenAI account for sentiment analysis.
5. Set up Google Sheets integration to log results.

### Practice
Create a simple feedback form using SurveyMonkey and test the workflow by submitting responses. Check if the feedback is logged correctly in the Google Sheet with sentiment analysis.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate customer feedback analysis, saving time and enhancing decision-making. This skill can attract clients who need efficient data processing, helping you build a profitable automation service.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "SurveyMonkey Trigger" and "SurveyMonkey Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
