# Postgres Filter Import Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving postgres, set, filter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: Set Default Error Workflow (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set Vars (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Exclude default_error:false Tagged Workflows (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get All Workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates error handling by updating workflows in a Postgres database, filtering out workflows tagged as "default_error:false," and running on a schedule or manual trigger. It ensures that only relevant workflows are processed, improving system reliability.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to manage automated error handling in their systems. For instance, if a software application encounters errors frequently, this workflow can update the error handling processes, ensuring smooth operation and minimal downtime.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n** on your server or use the cloud version.
2. **Create a New Workflow** and add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. **Add a Postgres Node** to update error workflows.
4. **Include a Filter Node** to exclude specific tagged workflows.
5. **Connect a Schedule Trigger** for regular checks.
6. **Test the workflow** to ensure proper functioning.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log errors into a Google Sheets document instead of Postgres. This will help you understand how to adapt workflows to different databases and data outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer businesses reliable error management solutions, reducing downtime and enhancing service reliability. This skill can attract clients looking for automation experts, helping you create value and grow your income in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Set Default Error Workflow" and "Get All Workflows" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
