# GoogleSheets Stickynote Monitor Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving agent, chatTrigger, executeWorkflowTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Workflow Input Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Window Buffer Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Expense text to JSON parser (informationExtractor)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Save expense into Google Sheets (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Parse msg and save to Sheets (toolWorkflow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates expense tracking. When a user sends a chat message about an expense, it uses AI to parse the message, convert it to JSON, and save it in Google Sheets, making expense management easier and more organized.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline expense reporting. Instead of manually entering expenses, employees can simply send a message in a chat (like “car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024”), and the workflow will log it in Google Sheets automatically.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Chat Trigger** node to receive messages.
3. Include an **OpenAI Chat Model** node to process the input.
4. Use an **Information Extractor** to parse the expense details.
5. Connect a **Google Sheets** node to save the parsed data.
6. Test by sending a sample expense message in chat.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a feature that sends a confirmation message back to the user after logging the expense. For example, respond with “Your expense has been recorded” along with the details saved.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you create automated solutions for clients, saving them time and reducing errors in expense management. This skill can attract more customers, enhance your service offerings, and generate income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "AI Agent" and "Parse msg and save to Sheets" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
