# Splitout Github Automate Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Globals (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get all files in given path (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Split the result (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Get file content from GitHub (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Convert files to JSON (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Restore n8n Workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of restoring workflows from GitHub backups. It starts when triggered manually, sets global variables for the GitHub repository, retrieves files, processes the contents, and restores the workflows into n8n.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly recover lost n8n workflows after a system failure. Instead of manually recreating each workflow, they can restore everything from their GitHub backup in minutes, ensuring business continuity.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the workflow.
3. Set up a Globals node to define your GitHub repo details.
4. Use the HTTP Request node to get all files from the specified GitHub path.
5. Split the results and fetch each file's content.
6. Convert the file contents to JSON format.
7. Use the n8n node to restore the workflows.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new GitHub repository or different folder path. Test the restoration process to see how it handles various types of workflows, ensuring you understand each step.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage and restore automated processes, reducing downtime and improving reliability. This skill can help attract clients needing robust backup solutions, generating potential income through your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Restore n8n Workflows" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
