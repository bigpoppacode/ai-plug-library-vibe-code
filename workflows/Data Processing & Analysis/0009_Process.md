## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving function, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Data 1** node.
2. **Step 1: Data 1 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Data 2 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Convert Data 1 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Convert Data 2 (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling and transforming data from two sources. It collects information about interviewers and their respective details, converts them into a usable format, and merges them for streamlined processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically gather and organize interviewer data for recruitment. Instead of manually collecting and sorting data, they can save time and reduce errors, allowing for more efficient hiring processes.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Function Node** for Data 1 and input the interviewers' data.
3. Add a second **Function Node** for Data 2 with additional details.
4. Use two **Convert Nodes** to format the data.
5. Add a **Merge Node** to combine the results using appropriate keys. 

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the sample data in Data 1 and Data 2. Observe how the merged output changes based on different inputs, reinforcing your understanding of data transformation and merging in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data handling tasks, making you more efficient. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, potentially generating significant income by offering these services as part of your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Data 1" and "Merge" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
