# Splitout Code Automate Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8n, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: GET - Workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: CREATE - Workflow (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: n8n - GET - Projects (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: SET Project ID (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: PUT - Workflow in Project (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: GET - Destination Workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Code (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Split Out Workflows (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Split Out Workflows1 (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Merge Workflows (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Split Out Projects (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Filter Project (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the cloning of workflows between different n8n instances using the n8n API. It retrieves workflows from one instance, creates them in another, and organizes them into specified projects, streamlining the process of managing multiple automation environments.

### Demonstrate
A business owner may need to duplicate workflows across different n8n instances for testing or scaling. For example, a marketing agency could replicate successful lead generation workflows to multiple client accounts, ensuring consistency and efficiency without manual setup.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** to start the workflow.
3. Use the **GET - Workflows** node to fetch workflows from the source instance.
4. Implement a **CREATE - Workflow** node to replicate each workflow in the target instance.
5. Use the **GET - Projects** node to organize the cloned workflows into specific projects.
6. Test the workflow by executing it and confirming the workflows are replicated correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to clone only specific workflows based on certain criteria, such as tags or names. This will help you understand how to filter and manage data within n8n effectively.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage multiple n8n instances, saving time and ensuring consistency. This skill can be a competitive advantage in your automation business, helping you attract clients who need scalable solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Filter Project" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
