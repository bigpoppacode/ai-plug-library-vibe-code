## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing keywords from a Google Sheet using AI. It fetches keywords, processes them in batches to prevent API rate limiting, and updates the sheet with the analysis results, determining if each keyword is related to known IT software.

### Demonstrate
A marketing consultant can use this workflow to analyze keywords for SEO. By automatically checking if keywords relate to specific software, they save time and ensure their content strategy is aligned with industry terms, leading to more effective marketing efforts.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Add a Google Sheets node to fetch keywords from your sheet.
3. Use an AI agent to analyze each keyword.
4. Process keywords in batches to avoid rate limits.
5. Update the Google Sheet with the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to analyze a different set of keywords or phrases. Change the AI's prompt to classify them by intent (e.g., informational, transactional) and see how the output varies.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate time-consuming keyword analysis, providing valuable insights for clients. This can enhance your service offerings, attract new customers, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Update Sheet with Analysis Results" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
