### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating events in Google Calendar based on data from a Google Sheet. When a new event is added to the sheet, the workflow retrieves the latest event details, formats the date, and creates a corresponding event in Google Calendar.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline scheduling. Instead of manually entering events from a spreadsheet into Google Calendar, it automatically creates calendar events based on new entries, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with columns for event name, description, start date, and location.
2. Import this workflow into n8n.
3. Connect your Google Sheets and Google Calendar accounts.
4. Test by adding a new event in the Google Sheet.
5. Execute the workflow to see the event created in Google Calendar.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include an event end date or invite guests by adding columns in your Google Sheet. Test the changes by adding a new entry and observing how it reflects in Google Calendar.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide value to clients by automating event management. This skill can attract new customers, increase your service offerings, and potentially generate income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Google Calendar Event Creator" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
