### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of verifying email addresses stored in Airtable using Mailcheck, ensuring that only valid emails are kept, which helps improve email deliverability and reduce bounce rates.

### Demonstrate
A marketing team can use this workflow to regularly clean their email list in Airtable. By verifying emails automatically, they reduce the risk of sending campaigns to invalid addresses, improving engagement and saving on costs associated with email bounces.

### Imitate
1. Set up an Airtable base with a table containing email addresses.
2. Create an n8n workflow with a Manual Trigger node.
3. Add a Mailcheck node to verify the email format.
4. Use a Set node to define valid/invalid status.
5. Add an Airtable node to update records based on verification results.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with a small sample of email addresses in Airtable. Modify the email list to include both valid and invalid addresses, and observe how the workflow updates the records accordingly.

### WIIFM

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
