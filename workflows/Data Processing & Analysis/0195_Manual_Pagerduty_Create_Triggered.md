## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates incident management in PagerDuty. It triggers an incident when executed, updates incident details, and retrieves the incident information, streamlining incident response for teams.

### Demonstrate
A developer or IT manager could use this workflow to automate the creation and management of incidents in PagerDuty. For instance, if a server goes down, the workflow can quickly log the incident, update its status, and retrieve details for reporting.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Insert a **PagerDuty node** to create an incident with details like title and service ID.
4. Add another **PagerDuty node** to update the incident, referencing the created incident ID.
5. Finally, add a **PagerDuty node** to retrieve the incident details using the updated incident ID.

### Practice
Experiment with the workflow by changing the incident title or adding additional fields in the PagerDuty node. Execute the workflow and observe how updates affect the incident in PagerDuty, reinforcing your understanding of data flow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate critical incident management tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients in IT and operations, helping you build a service around automated incident response, thus generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "PagerDuty1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
