# Manual uProc Import Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, functionItem, uproc.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Create Domain Item (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get DNS records (uproc)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves DNS records for a specified domain. It starts with a manual trigger, creates a domain item, and then fetches the DNS records based on that domain item.

### Demonstrate
A web development agency might use this workflow to quickly check DNS settings for client websites. By automating this process, they save time and ensure accurate configurations without manual checks.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Function Item** node to set your domain (e.g., `item.domain = "example.com"; return item;`).
4. Add a **Get DNS records** node to fetch DNS info using the domain from the previous step.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the domain in the **Function Item** node to see how the workflow reacts to different domains. Check if the DNS records change accordingly upon execution.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate DNS checks for clients, adding value to web management services. This can help you attract more clients while saving time and reducing errors, ultimately increasing your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Get DNS records" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
