# Manual Coda Create Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, coda, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Coda (coda)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of inserting data into a new row in a Coda table. It starts with a manual trigger, sets specific data values, and then sends this data to Coda, creating a new entry in the specified table.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline data entry. For example, when a customer fills out a form, the workflow can automatically log their details into a Coda table, saving time and reducing errors in manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n and add a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add a **Set** node to define the data for the columns.
3. Connect the **Set** node to a **Coda** node, configuring it with the appropriate document and table IDs.
4. Execute the workflow to test data insertion into Coda.

### Practice
Try modifying the values in the Set node to insert different data into Coda. Execute the workflow and check the Coda table to confirm that the new data appears correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you time and effort in data management tasks, making you more efficient. It also positions you as a valuable resource for businesses looking to automate their processes, potentially leading to new clients and increased income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
