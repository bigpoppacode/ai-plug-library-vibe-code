### Explain
This n8n workflow checks RSS feeds every hour for new posts. If a post is published within the last hour, it sends an email notification with the post's details to a specified email address. It automates content monitoring and updates.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor their industry blogs or news sites. If a new article relevant to their business is posted, they receive an email update, allowing them to stay informed without manual checks.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** to run every hour.
3. Add your desired **RSS feed URLs**.
4. Configure the **Gmail node** with your email credentials.
5. Customize the email content to include relevant post details.

### Practice
Create a personal RSS feed list and set the workflow to notify you of new posts. Test it by adding a new post to one of your feeds and see if you receive the email alert as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate content monitoring for clients, enhancing their engagement with relevant updates. This can lead to increased value in your services and potential income as a consultant offering automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Every 1 hour" and "List of RSS feeds" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
