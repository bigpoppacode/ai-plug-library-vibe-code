# Manual HTTP Create Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, readWriteFile.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Create Transcript1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Read/Write Files from Disk (readWriteFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a transcript from an audio file. It starts when the user manually triggers it, then sends an audio file to an API for transcription, and finally saves the transcripted text to a file on disk.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to transform recorded meetings into text transcripts. This saves time and improves accessibility, allowing for easy reference and note-taking after discussions.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to send the audio file to a transcription API.
4. Add a Read/Write File node to save the transcript locally.
5. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the audio file path in the Read/Write File node to point to a different audio file. Run the workflow to see if it successfully transcribes the new audio file.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer transcription services as part of your automation offerings, creating value for clients who need to process audio content efficiently. It can lead to new revenue streams in content creation or customer service.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Read/Write Files from Disk" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
