### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of adding or updating a contact in Mautic when a new event is created in Calendly. It triggers on new event data, processes the information, and logs it accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to automatically manage client scheduling. When a client books a meeting through Calendly, their contact details are updated in Mautic, ensuring seamless follow-up and tracking without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a "Calendly Trigger" node to listen for new events.
3. Connect a "Create/Update Contact" node for Mautic to handle the incoming data.
4. Use the output from the trigger to populate the contact fields.
5. Add a note or log entry for future reference.

### Practice
Create a test Calendly event and ensure it triggers the workflow. Check if the contact is correctly created or updated in Mautic, and verify that the information is logged as intended.

### WIIFM

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
