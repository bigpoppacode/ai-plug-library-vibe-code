### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving slides from a Google Slides presentation and generating thumbnails for each slide, triggered manually by the user. It streamlines the collection of visual content for easy access or sharing.

### Demonstrate

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node** to start the workflow.
3. Connect a **Google Slides Node** to fetch slides using a specific presentation ID.
4. Add another **Google Slides Node** to retrieve thumbnails for each slide.
5. Execute the workflow to see the slides and their thumbnails retrieved automatically.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the presentation ID to a different Google Slides document. Execute it to confirm that the thumbnails for the new presentation are generated correctly, reinforcing your understanding of the workflow’s functionality.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
