## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow syncs new Shopify customers to Odoo contacts. When a new customer is created in Shopify, it checks if they already exist in Odoo, and if not, it creates a new contact in Odoo with the customer's details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner using Shopify wants to keep their customer database updated in Odoo automatically. This workflow ensures that every new customer in Shopify is added to Odoo, saving time on manual entry and maintaining accurate records.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Shopify Trigger node to listen for new customer creations.
2. Add a Search Odoo Contact node to check if the customer already exists.
3. Use a Code node to determine if the customer is new.
4. If new, use a Create Contact node to add them to Odoo.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it runs as expected.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that syncs new orders from Shopify to a Google Sheet. Use a Shopify Trigger for new orders, and add a Google Sheets node to log the order details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate customer management, reducing manual tasks and errors. This skill can attract clients looking for efficiency, allowing you to offer valuable automation services and increase your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Filter" and "Code" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
