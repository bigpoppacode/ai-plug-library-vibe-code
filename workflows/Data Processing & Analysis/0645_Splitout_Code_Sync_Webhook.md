14. **Step 13: Merge2 (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Your Linear Project 2 (linearTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Your Linear Project 1 (linearTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow syncs project statuses and timelines between Linear and Productboard. It triggers on updates, fetches relevant data, transforms it, and updates both platforms accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A project manager might use this workflow to ensure that the status of a feature in Linear automatically updates in Productboard, keeping all stakeholders informed without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up triggers for Linear updates.
3. Configure HTTP requests to fetch and update Productboard data.
4. Map statuses and timeframes between the two systems.
5. Test to ensure data sync works correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple version of the workflow that only updates the status between Linear and Productboard. Experiment with different statuses and observe the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate project management tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This can attract clients looking for efficient solutions, ultimately boosting your income in automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "linear project id" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
