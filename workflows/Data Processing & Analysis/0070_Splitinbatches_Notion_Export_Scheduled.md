## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of archiving empty pages in a Notion database. It checks daily for pages without content and moves them to an archive, helping to keep the database clean and organized.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to maintain a Notion database for project management. By automatically archiving empty pages, they save time and ensure that only relevant, active pages are visible, improving team productivity.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Notion account and create a database.
2. Import this n8n workflow.
3. Configure the Notion nodes with your database credentials.
4. Adjust the conditions in the workflow to fit your specific criteria for archiving.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it archives empty pages correctly.

### Practice
Try adding a new page to your Notion database, leaving it empty. Run the workflow to see if it archives that page. Then, fill in the page with content and check if the workflow skips archiving it.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to clean up databases efficiently, enhancing your value as a consultant or developer. It helps clients maintain organized systems, leading to improved workflows and increased satisfaction, which can generate recurring income opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
