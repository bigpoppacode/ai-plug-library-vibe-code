# Send Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving chatTrigger, memoryBufferWindow, lmChatOpenAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Simple Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: SerpAPI (toolSerpApi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of responding to chat messages. It receives a message, stores memory, uses OpenAI for processing, queries SerpAPI for information, and sends the response back through an AI agent.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to create a customer support chatbot. Instead of manually answering FAQs, the chatbot can provide instant responses using AI, improving customer satisfaction and reducing staff workload.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Chat Trigger** to start the workflow when a message is received.
2. Add a **Memory Node** to store context from previous interactions.
3. Integrate an **OpenAI Node** to analyze the message and generate a response.
4. Use a **SerpAPI Node** to fetch additional information if needed.
5. Connect to an **AI Agent Node** to send the final response back to the user.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow that only responds to a specific keyword in a chat. Test it by sending messages and check if the bot replies correctly. 

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you streamline customer interactions, allowing for faster support and increased satisfaction. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions, creating potential revenue streams in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "AI Agent" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
