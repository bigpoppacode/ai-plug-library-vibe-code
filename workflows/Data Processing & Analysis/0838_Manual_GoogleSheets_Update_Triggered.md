## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scoring LinkedIn profiles by extracting key information (like name, job title, connections) and calculating an ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) score. It updates a Google Sheet with the results after processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently evaluate potential leads by scoring their LinkedIn profiles, helping prioritize outreach efforts based on their ICP score, thus focusing on high-value prospects.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure Google Sheets and Airtop nodes with your credentials.
3. Set up a manual trigger to start the workflow.
4. Define the LinkedIn URL for scoring.
5. Execute the workflow to see results populate in Google Sheets.

### Practice
Create a test LinkedIn profile with varying data. Run the workflow and observe how different inputs affect the ICP score. Modify the scoring criteria in the workflow to see how it impacts results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide valuable lead scoring services, helping businesses focus on high-potential customers. This can differentiate your automation offerings, attract clients, and potentially generate significant income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Get person" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
