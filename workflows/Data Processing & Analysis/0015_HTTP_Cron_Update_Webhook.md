# HTTP Cron Update Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: AMQP Sender (amqp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically retrieves the position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute and sends this data to an ActiveMQ topic. It consists of a cron trigger, an HTTP request to get the ISS position, data transformation, and sending to a messaging queue.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor satellite positions for a space-related application. For example, a company that tracks satellites for research could automate data collection and alert systems to improve response times for satellite monitoring.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Cron** node to trigger every minute.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch the ISS position from the provided API.
4. Use a **Set** node to format the data (latitude, longitude, timestamp).
5. Connect an **AMQP Sender** node to send the formatted data to your ActiveMQ topic.

### Practice
Create a simple version of the workflow that retrieves weather data from an API every minute instead of the ISS position. Send the weather data to a different messaging service, like Slack, to reinforce your understanding of the workflow steps.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate real-time data collection, enhancing your service offerings. You can provide clients with valuable insights, improve operations, and reduce manual work, ultimately increasing your revenue through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "AMQP Sender" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
