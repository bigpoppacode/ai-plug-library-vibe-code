## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management by fetching tasks from a Todoist project, filtering them based on today's date, and creating new tasks in the Inbox while applying due dates based on task descriptions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to daily automate task creation based on a template. For instance, if they have recurring tasks each week, this setup saves time by automatically generating today's tasks, ensuring nothing is missed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure Todoist API credentials.
3. Set up a template project in Todoist with tasks labeled for specific days.
4. Adjust schedule triggers for when to run the workflow.
5. Test by checking the Inbox for newly created tasks.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only fetches and displays tasks for today in a sticky note instead of creating new tasks. This allows you to understand filtering and data manipulation without affecting your actual task list.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate your task management, saving time and reducing manual errors. For consultants, it provides a repeatable service to offer clients, enhancing productivity and scaling operations effectively.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note3" and "Create new task in Inbox" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
