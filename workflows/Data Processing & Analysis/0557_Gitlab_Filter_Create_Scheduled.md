# GitLab Filter Create Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8n, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Backup Now - Manual Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Backup Now - Manual Trigger (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: n8n (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Globals (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Create New File(s) (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Edit Existing File(s) (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Derive Filename From Workflow Name (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Fetch Existing File Content (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Skip Unchanged Files (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Fetch List of Existing Files (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Combine Gitlab Existing Files as Single List Item (aggregate)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: File Exists in Gitlab? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup of workflow definitions to GitLab. It allows users to manually trigger a backup, create or edit files based on the workflow name, and handle existing files intelligently, ensuring only changed files are updated.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to regularly back up automated processes to GitLab. This ensures that if a change is needed or a failure occurs, they can restore previous versions without losing any important configurations or data.

### Imitate
1. Start n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to initiate the backup.
3. Use a **Set** node to define variables like GitLab project and owner.
4. Add nodes to create or edit files on GitLab based on the workflow name.
5. Connect nodes to manage existing files and filter unchanged ones.
6. Test the workflow by executing it and checking GitLab for backups.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to back up to a different service (e.g., Dropbox). Change the file creation/editing nodes to connect with Dropbox and adjust the file paths accordingly. Execute the workflow and verify the backup.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow lets you offer valuable automation services, like regular backups for businesses. It enhances data security and reliability, making your offerings more attractive to potential clients, ultimately increasing your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Backup Now - Manual Trigger" and "File Exists in Gitlab?" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
