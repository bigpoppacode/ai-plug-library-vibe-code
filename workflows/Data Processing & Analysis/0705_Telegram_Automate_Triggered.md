### Explain
This n8n workflow automates interactions on Telegram. It listens for messages, checks if they contain stickers, and responds accordingly. If a sticker is present, it sends back details about it; if not, it informs the user that no sticker was found.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to engage users on Telegram, enhancing customer service. For example, a brand can automatically reply with sticker information, keeping users entertained and informed, and improving user interaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Telegram bot and connect it to n8n.
2. Add a **Telegram Trigger** to listen for incoming messages.
3. Create an **If Node** to check if the message contains a sticker.
4. Add two **Telegram nodes**: one to respond with sticker details and another to inform if no sticker is present.
5. Test the workflow by sending messages with and without stickers.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to respond with a different message or action based on the sticker type (e.g., send a unique reply for each sticker). Test the changes by sending various sticker messages.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
