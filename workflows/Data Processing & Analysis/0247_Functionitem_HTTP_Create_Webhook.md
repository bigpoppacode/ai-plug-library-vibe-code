## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating products and their pricing in Stripe whenever a new product is added in Pipedrive, ensuring seamless integration between sales and payment systems.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to automatically sync new products from their sales CRM (Pipedrive) to their payment processor (Stripe), saving time and reducing errors when launching new products.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Pipedrive Trigger for new products.
2. Use a Function Item to filter current product data.
3. Create the product in Stripe with an HTTP Request node.
4. Merge the created product ID back into the data.
5. Set to keep only the product ID.
6. Create price records in Stripe.
7. Split prices to separate items for processing.

### Practice
Try adding a new product in Pipedrive and observe if it creates the corresponding product and pricing in Stripe automatically. Modify product details and see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline product management and payment processing, making you more efficient and valuable to clients. This skill can lead to higher demand for your automation services, increasing your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On product created" and "Split prices to seperate items" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
