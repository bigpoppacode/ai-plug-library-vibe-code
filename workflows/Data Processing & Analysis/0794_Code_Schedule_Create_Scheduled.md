## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of inviting new users to a system by comparing existing users with a list from Google Sheets. When triggered, it fetches user data, identifies non-users, and sends out invitation emails.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate onboarding for new customers. For example, when a new sign-up occurs, the system checks against existing users and sends invites to those who aren't already registered, ensuring no one is missed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Connect to Google Sheets to get user data.
4. Use an HTTP Request node to fetch current users.
5. Merge data to find non-users.
6. Configure an HTTP Request to send invites.
7. Test the workflow to ensure it works as expected.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with sample user data and test the workflow by manually triggering it. Observe the flow of data from fetching existing users to sending out invites, making adjustments as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline user onboarding, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, enhancing your value as an AI automation consultant and potentially increasing your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Combine all paginated results" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
