### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a discount coupon in Paddle when triggered manually. It starts with a manual execution trigger and then uses Paddle's API to create a coupon with a specified discount and coupon code.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically generate discount coupons for promotions. For example, during a holiday sale, they can quickly create discount codes without manual input, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Paddle** node and configure it with your Paddle API credentials.
4. Set parameters like `discountAmount` and `couponCode`.
5. Connect the Manual Trigger to the Paddle node and save the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the `discountAmount` and `couponCode` parameters in the Paddle node. Execute the workflow to see how different values affect the coupon creation process. 

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow means you can help businesses automate their promotional efforts, increasing efficiency and accuracy. This skill can attract clients looking for streamlined marketing solutions, enhancing your value as an automation expert.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Paddle" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
