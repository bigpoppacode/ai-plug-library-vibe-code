# Splitout Filter Monitor Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, splitInBatches, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Edit Fields-set_model_data (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Google Sheets-Clear Sheet Data (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: n8n-get all workflow (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Filter-get workflow contain modelid (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Split Out-nodes (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Filter-node contain modelId (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Google Sheets-Save node and workflow data (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking which AI model is being used in various workflows. It starts with manual triggering, loops through workflows, gathers data about them, and saves relevant information into Google Sheets for easy tracking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor and analyze AI models used in their automated systems, ensuring the right models are deployed and optimizing performance. This helps in maintaining efficiency and making informed decisions about AI usage.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use **Split In Batches** to loop over workflows.
4. Add **Set** nodes to format data for Google Sheets.
5. Connect **Google Sheets** nodes to clear and save data.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it captures necessary model information.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the Google Sheets document ID or adding additional filters to the model data. Run the workflow and check if it successfully updates your Google Sheet with the correct information.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline AI usage tracking, enhance operational efficiency, and provide valuable insights to clients. This skill can help you attract more customers by offering tailored automation solutions that improve their AI management processes.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
