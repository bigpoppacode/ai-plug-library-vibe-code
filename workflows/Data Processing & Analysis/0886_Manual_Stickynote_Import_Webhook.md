## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of uploading a photo to a SharePoint site using Microsoft Graph API. It starts when triggered manually, retrieves a test image, sets configuration values (like authentication), and finally uploads the photo to a specified destination folder.

### Demonstrate
A marketing consultant could use this workflow to automate the uploading of promotional images to SharePoint after a campaign ends. Instead of manually uploading images, they can streamline the process, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow and add a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add an **HTTP Request** node to retrieve a test image.
3. Use a **Set** node to define the authentication details (e.g., Tenant ID, Client ID).
4. Add another **Set** node to configure the target upload folder and file name.
5. Add an **HTTP Request** node to upload the retrieved image to SharePoint.
6. Test the workflow by executing it from the manual trigger.

### Practice
Try creating a simple version of this workflow that uploads a different file type (like a PDF) to a local folder instead of SharePoint. Adjust the nodes accordingly to understand how the upload process works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, making you more efficient. It positions you as a valuable resource for businesses looking to streamline operations, potentially leading to more clients and increased income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Authentication" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
