# Manual Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Mock data (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Summing function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of summing a set of mock financial data. It starts with a manual trigger, generates mock data amounts, and then sums these amounts to provide a total value.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly aggregate sales figures or expenses from various sources, saving time on manual calculations and improving accuracy in financial reporting.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Function** node for generating mock data (use provided code).
4. Add another **Function** node to sum the mock data.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the total.

### Practice
Modify the mock data function to include different amounts or categories (e.g., expenses, income) and re-run the workflow to see how the total changes. This will help reinforce understanding of data manipulation in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive calculations, enhance reporting accuracy, and free up time for strategic tasks, making your services more valuable to clients and boosting your income potential in automation consultancy.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Summing function" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
