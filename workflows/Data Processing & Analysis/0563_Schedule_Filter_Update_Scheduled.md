## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management by updating task priorities in Todoist based on a scheduled trigger. It retrieves inbox tasks, classifies them using OpenAI, and updates their priority, ensuring tasks are organized efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline project management. For instance, if they receive many incoming tasks daily, this automation helps prioritize and categorize tasks, ensuring the team focuses on high-priority items without manual sorting.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the Schedule Trigger to run at your desired frequency.
3. Set up your Todoist API credentials.
4. Adjust the project names and priorities in the "Your Projects" node.
5. Test the workflow to ensure tasks update as intended.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow. Set it to categorize one type of task in Todoist based on a specific keyword. Run it manually to see how tasks update, reinforcing your understanding of node connections and data flow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients, helping them improve productivity and task management. This expertise can lead to higher-paying projects and recurring revenue opportunities as businesses look to optimize their operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Update priority in todoist" and "If other or ai hallucinates" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
