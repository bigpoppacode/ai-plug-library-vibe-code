# Manual Splitinbatches Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a manual trigger initiates a function that generates a series of items, processes them in batches, checks a condition, and optionally sets a message based on that condition.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate daily reporting. For example, when they click a button, the workflow generates a report, processes it in segments, checks if the report is complete, and sends a notification if it is.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Function** node to generate items (e.g., numbers 1-10).
4. Connect to a **Split In Batches** node to process each item.
5. Add an **IF** node to check if the batch index equals 5.
6. Connect to a **Set** node to send a message like "Loop Ended" if true.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the batch size in the **Split In Batches** node. Observe how it affects the processing of items and the output message when the condition is met.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors. It positions you as a valuable asset in automation services, helping clients improve efficiency and scale operations effectively.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
