## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates ticket handling between Zendesk and GitHub. When a new support ticket is created in Zendesk, it checks if a related GitHub issue exists. If it does, it adds a comment; if not, it creates a new GitHub issue and updates the Zendesk ticket with the issue number.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline support operations. For instance, a software company receives support tickets in Zendesk. By automating the creation and management of corresponding GitHub issues, they can efficiently track and resolve bugs, enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. **Add Webhook Trigger**: Use the Zendesk webhook to start the workflow when a new ticket arrives.
3. **Get Ticket Details**: Add the "Get Ticket" node to fetch ticket data.
4. **Determine Issue Status**: Use a "Function" node to check if a GitHub issue exists.
5. **Create or Update Issue**: Add "Create Issue" and "Update Ticket" nodes based on the existence of the issue.
6. **Connect Nodes**: Link them according to the workflow logic.

### Practice
Try creating a simple version of this workflow: set it up to trigger from a form submission (like Google Forms) instead of Zendesk. Create a GitHub issue based on the form data and send a confirmation email to the submitter.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to businesses, saving them time and improving their customer service. By streamlining support processes, you can attract more clients seeking efficiency and enhance your income potential as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get ticket" and "On new Zendesk ticket" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
