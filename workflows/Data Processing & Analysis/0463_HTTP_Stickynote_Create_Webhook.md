## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow verifies mailing addresses for new contacts in HighLevel. When a new contact is added, it checks if the address is valid. If valid, it tags the contact as "Deliverable"; if not, it triggers a manual verification process.

### Demonstrate
A business owner uses this workflow to ensure accurate mailing addresses for marketing campaigns. Valid addresses save costs on postage and improve delivery rates, enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to capture new contacts from your CRM.
2. Use the Set node to define address fields.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to verify addresses via an API.
4. Use a Switch node to determine if the address is deliverable.
5. Update your CRM with the verification results.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow. Test it with dummy contact data to verify addresses. Adjust parameters to see how changes affect the workflow's outcome.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate address verification, reducing manual errors and saving time. This skill can attract clients needing data accuracy, positioning you to create valuable automation solutions and generate income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Switch" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
