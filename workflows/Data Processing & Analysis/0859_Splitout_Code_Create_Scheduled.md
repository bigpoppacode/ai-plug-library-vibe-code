## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically fetches the latest news articles from two RSS feeds, processes the data, selects the top five articles using AI, and sends a formatted email digest to a specified recipient daily.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep their executive team informed with a daily email summarizing the most relevant articles, saving time on manual research and ensuring they stay updated on key industry trends.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the RSS feed nodes for your preferred sources.
3. Adjust the AI selection criteria in the ChatGPT node.
4. Set your email parameters (recipient, subject, body).
5. Schedule the workflow to run daily.

### Practice
Try modifying the email template to include additional information, like an executive summary or key quotes from the articles. Test the workflow to see how your changes affect the final email.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, streamline their information gathering, and position yourself as a tech-savvy consultant, ultimately leading to higher income opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Data Collection" and "Schedule Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
