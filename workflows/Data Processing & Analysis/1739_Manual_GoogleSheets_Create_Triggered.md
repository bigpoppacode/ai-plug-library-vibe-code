## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering URLs and related people data based on input criteria. It starts with a manual trigger, formats results, fetches URLs and people data, removes duplicates, and then saves the final data into a Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to compile a list of top influencers in a specific niche (like "Build in Public") for marketing outreach. It automates the tedious task of searching, filtering, and organizing the data, saving hours of manual work.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the manual trigger to start the process.
3. Customize the "Parameters" node with your target keywords.
4. Adjust the Airtop nodes to fetch relevant URLs and people data.
5. Connect the Google Sheets node to save results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the search keywords in the "Parameters" node. Run the workflow and check the Google Sheet to see how the results differ based on your input. This will help you understand the data fetching process better.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection, making you more efficient. It opens opportunities to offer automation services to businesses, helping them save time and reduce costs, which can lead to increased income for you as a consultant or developer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Parameters" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
