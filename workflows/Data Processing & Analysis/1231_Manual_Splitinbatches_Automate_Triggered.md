# Manual Splitinbatches Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user manually triggers an execution, creates items using a function, splits those items into batches, checks conditions, and sets a message if all items are processed. It effectively manages data flow and actions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate tasks like processing customer feedback in batches—ensuring efficient handling of large volumes without manual oversight, ultimately saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Use a Function node to generate data items (e.g., 10 customer feedback entries).
4. Implement a SplitInBatches node to process each entry one at a time.
5. Use an IF node to check if there are items left; if not, use a Set node to display a message.

### Practice
Try modifying the Function node to generate a different number of items (e.g., 5 or 20). Run the workflow and observe how it handles the changes, ensuring the output is as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate repetitive tasks, making your services more efficient, scalable, and attractive to potential clients. This skill can lead to increased revenue by offering automation solutions that save businesses time and resources.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
