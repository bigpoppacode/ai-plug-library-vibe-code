Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: SecurityScorecard (securityScorecard)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating, retrieving, and downloading security scorecards for a specified identifier (like a domain name) using the SecurityScorecard API, triggered manually by the user.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly generate security reports for their website, assess vulnerabilities, and improve their cybersecurity posture without manual data collection, saving time and enhancing security awareness.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your SecurityScorecard API credentials.
3. Adjust the `scorecardIdentifier` parameter to your domain.
4. Execute the workflow to generate and download the scorecard.

### Practice
As an exercise, modify the workflow to generate scorecards for multiple domains by creating a loop or a list of identifiers, and observe the automation in action.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable cybersecurity insights to clients, helping them identify vulnerabilities and enhance their security practices, potentially turning into a revenue-generating service in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "SecurityScorecard2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
