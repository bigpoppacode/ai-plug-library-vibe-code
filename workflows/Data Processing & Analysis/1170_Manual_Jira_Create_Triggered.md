### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a new issue in Jira when a manual trigger is activated. It streamlines task management by allowing users to quickly log issues without manual data entry.

2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Jira** node to create an issue.
   - Set the project and issue type.
   - Customize the summary (e.g., "New software bug").
4. Connect the nodes.
5. Execute the workflow to log an issue in Jira.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the issue summary and project parameters in the Jira node. Execute it multiple times with different summaries to see how it creates various issues in Jira.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
