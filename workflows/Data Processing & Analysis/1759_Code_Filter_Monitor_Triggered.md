## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors competitor pricing by automatically retrieving URLs from Google Sheets, checking their prices using an AI tool, and updating the results in the sheet while notifying you of significant changes via Slack.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to stay competitive by tracking price changes of similar products, ensuring they can adjust their pricing strategy in real-time based on market trends.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Slack accounts.
3. Set up the pricing URLs in Google Sheets.
4. Configure the AI tool for price checking.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates and notifies you correctly.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that only checks one pricing URL and sends you a Slack notification if the price changes, allowing you to familiarize yourself with the nodes and setup.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable pricing analysis services to clients, enhancing their competitive edge and potentially generating additional income through consulting or automation service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Filter out similar" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
