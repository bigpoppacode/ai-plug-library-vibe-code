## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically collects financial metrics from ProfitWell every month and sends them to a Mattermost channel, providing teams with timely insights on customer activity and revenue.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep their team updated with key financial metrics like active customers and recurring revenue, ensuring everyone stays informed on monthly performance without manual reporting.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Cron Node** to trigger the workflow monthly.
2. Add a **ProfitWell Node** to fetch financial data.
3. Connect a **Mattermost Node** to send the data to a specific channel.
4. Customize the message format to suit your team's needs.
5. Activate the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send data weekly instead of monthly. Change the Cron Node settings to trigger every week and adjust the message in the Mattermost Node to include additional metrics.

### WIIFM

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
