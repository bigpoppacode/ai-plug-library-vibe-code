## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering meeting data from Google Calendar, enriching it with recent social media activity from LinkedIn and Twitter, and then sending a summary email to attendees. It runs every morning at 7 AM, ensuring timely communication about relevant social updates.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to prepare personalized emails for meeting attendees, highlighting their recent social media activity. This enhances engagement and shows preparation, making a favorable impression during meetings.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google Calendar and social media API credentials in the "Setup" node.
3. Adjust recipient emails in the "Setup" node.
4. Modify the email template in the "Prepare email template" node as needed.
5. Test the workflow by triggering it and verifying the email output.

### Practice
Create a simplified version by modifying the workflow to send a daily email summary of just one social media platform (e.g., only LinkedIn). This will help reinforce understanding of how each node interacts and processes information.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows students to offer high-value automation services, improving client engagement through personalized communications. This skill can help generate income by attracting clients looking to enhance their outreach and relationship management through automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Setup" and "Get latest tweets" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
