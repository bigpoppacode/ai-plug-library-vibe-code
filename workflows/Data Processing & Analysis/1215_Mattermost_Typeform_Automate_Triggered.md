## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically analyzes customer feedback submitted via a Typeform, checks the sentiment using AWS Comprehend, and sends a notification to a Mattermost channel if the feedback is negative. It helps businesses quickly respond to customer concerns.

### Demonstrate
A business owner wants to improve customer satisfaction. By using this workflow, they can instantly analyze feedback from events and identify negative sentiments, allowing them to address issues promptly and enhance customer experience.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform to collect feedback.
2. Create an n8n workflow with a Typeform Trigger.
3. Add an AWS Comprehend node to analyze sentiment.
4. Use an IF node to check if the sentiment is negative.
5. Add a Mattermost node to notify the team.

### Practice
Experiment by submitting different feedback through your Typeform. Monitor the Mattermost channel for notifications based on the sentiment analysis. Adjust the feedback to see how the workflow responds to different sentiments (positive, neutral, negative).

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable asset in automation services. It helps you create systems that enhance customer engagement and satisfaction, potentially attracting clients who need efficient feedback management solutions, leading to increased income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Mattermost" and "Typeform Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
