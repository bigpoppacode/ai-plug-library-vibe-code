# HTTP Kafka Update Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Kafka (kafka)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks the position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute and sends updates to a Kafka topic. It automates data retrieval and messaging, allowing users to track the ISS's location in real-time.

### Demonstrate
A business owner in the aerospace industry could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position for educational purposes. By sending live updates to a Kafka topic, they can provide real-time data to apps or services for schools or museums, enhancing learning experiences.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger every minute.
2. Use an HTTP Request node to fetch ISS position data from `https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544/positions`.
3. Add a Set node to structure the retrieved data (name, latitude, longitude, timestamp).
4. Connect a Kafka node to send this structured data to a Kafka topic.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log the ISS position data into a Google Sheet instead of sending it to Kafka. This will help you understand how to adapt workflows for different outputs and data storage solutions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to create real-time data applications, enhancing your portfolio as an automation consultant. It showcases your ability to integrate various technologies, which can attract clients seeking innovative tracking or monitoring solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Kafka" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
