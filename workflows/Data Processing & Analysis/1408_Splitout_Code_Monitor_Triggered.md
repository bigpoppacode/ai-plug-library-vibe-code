4. **Step 3: Basic LLM Chain4 (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Ollama Chat Model (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Edit Fields (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Filter (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: When Executed by Another Workflow (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Aggregate (aggregate)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Merge1 (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Basic LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Ollama Model (lmOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing and summarizing text. It takes input text, splits it into sentences, processes each sentence through AI models for analysis, and outputs structured data, making it useful for tasks like content review or data extraction.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate the review of customer feedback. Instead of manually reading each comment, the workflow can analyze sentiments and summarize key points, saving time and improving response strategies.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Use the Code node to input your text.
4. Connect the Split Out node to break the text into sentences.
5. Add AI processing nodes for analysis.
6. Output results to a Google Sheet or send an email summary.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the input text in the Code node. Change the content to see how the workflow handles different sentences and observe the output to understand how each part processes the information.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services, helping clients save time and improve decision-making processes, which can lead to increased revenue and customer satisfaction. This skill can position you as a sought-after consultant in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Code" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
