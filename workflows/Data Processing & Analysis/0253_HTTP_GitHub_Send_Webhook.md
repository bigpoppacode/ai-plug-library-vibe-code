# HTTP Github Send Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, pipedrive, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **ON Pull Request** node.
2. **Step 1: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Search PR user in Pipedrive by email (pipedrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: person exists (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Pipedrive (pipedrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: ON Pull Request (githubTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing pull requests from GitHub. When a new pull request is created, it retrieves the user's email, checks if they exist in Pipedrive, and logs a note about the pull request in Pipedrive if they do.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to streamline collaboration. When a contributor submits a pull request, the workflow checks if they are a known contact in Pipedrive, ensuring their contributions are tracked for future reference and follow-ups.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance.
2. Create a new workflow and add a GitHub Trigger node for pull requests.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch user details using the pull request's data.
4. Connect a Pipedrive node to search for the user by email.
5. Use an If node to check if the user exists, and log the PR in Pipedrive if they do.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send a notification (e.g., via Slack) when a new pull request is logged. This will reinforce how data flows through nodes and how to integrate additional actions based on conditions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate tedious tasks, improve collaboration, and enhance project management efficiency. As a consultant, you can offer this service to clients, helping them streamline their development processes and better track contributions, thus increasing your value and income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTTP Request" and "ON Pull Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
