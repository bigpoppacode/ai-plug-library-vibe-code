### Explain
This n8n workflow automates creating tasks in Asana when a specific action occurs via a Webhook. It captures input data, creates a task in Asana, and sets a confirmation message with a link to the created task.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate task management. For example, when a customer submits a request form, a task is automatically created in Asana for the team to follow up, ensuring timely responses without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Webhook in n8n to capture form submissions.
2. Connect the Webhook to an Asana node to create a task using the submitted data.
3. Use a Set node to format a confirmation message with the task link.
4. Test the workflow by submitting the form and check Asana for the new task.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional fields in the Asana task, like due dates or priority levels. Submit a test form and verify if the new fields populate correctly in Asana.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to save time on task management and enhance team productivity. By automating repetitive tasks, you can focus on higher-value work, improving client satisfaction and potentially increasing your revenue as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Asana" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
