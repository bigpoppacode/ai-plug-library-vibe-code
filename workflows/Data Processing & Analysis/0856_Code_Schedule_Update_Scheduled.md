## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching the latest USD exchange rates from an API, updating a Google Sheets document with the rates, and archiving past rates for reference. It runs daily, ensuring up-to-date financial data.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update their pricing model based on real-time currency fluctuations, ensuring they remain competitive in international markets without manual adjustments.

### Imitate
1. Set up a n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily at 8 AM.
3. Use an **HTTP Request** node to fetch USD exchange rates.
4. Add a **Google Sheets** node to update the current rates.
5. Use another **Google Sheets** node to archive the previous rates.
6. Test the workflow and check the Google Sheets for updated data.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to pull exchange rates for a different base currency (e.g., EUR). Change the API URL accordingly and observe how it affects the data in your Google Sheets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses needing real-time data management, enhancing your skills as an automation consultant and potentially increasing your income by providing tailored solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Filter Fields" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
