# Manual CircleCI Import Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, circleCi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: CircleCI (circleCi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving a pipeline from CircleCI when triggered manually. It uses a manual trigger to start the workflow and then connects to CircleCI to fetch specific project details.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to quickly check the build status of their CI/CD pipeline in CircleCI. Instead of logging in and navigating the interface, they could trigger this workflow to get the latest pipeline data directly.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node**.
3. Add a **CircleCI Node** and configure it with your CircleCI API credentials.
4. Set the parameters for the project slug and VCS.
5. Connect the Manual Trigger to the CircleCI Node.
6. Save and execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional actions, such as sending the retrieved pipeline status to a Slack channel or logging it in a Google Sheet. This will enhance your understanding of how to integrate multiple services.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate repetitive tasks, save time, and improve project management efficiency. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, potentially generating income for your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "CircleCI" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
