# Manual Redis Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, redis.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Redis (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where clicking 'execute' triggers a connection to a Redis database to retrieve a value associated with the key "hello". It's a simple way to fetch data from a database without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to fetch configuration settings from a Redis database whenever a service needs to read the latest settings without hardcoding them, ensuring the application always uses the most current data.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Redis node** and set it to "get" with the key "hello".
4. Connect the **Manual Trigger** to the **Redis node**.
5. Execute the workflow to see the fetched data.

### Practice
Try modifying the Redis key in the workflow to fetch a different value. Execute the workflow again to observe how the output changes based on the new key you set.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you streamline data retrieval in applications, making your processes more efficient. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, increasing your value and income potential in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Redis" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
