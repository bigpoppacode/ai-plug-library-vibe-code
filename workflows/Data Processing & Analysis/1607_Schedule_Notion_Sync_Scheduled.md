# Schedule Notion Sync Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving scheduleTrigger, todoist, notion.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: On schedule (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get all tasks with specific label (todoist)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Add to Notion database (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Replace label on task (todoist)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically syncs tasks from Todoist to a Notion database. It starts on a schedule, retrieves tasks with a specific label, adds them to Notion, and then updates the Todoist task label to indicate that it has been processed.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to regularly sync tasks labeled "send-to-notion" from Todoist to a Notion database for better project tracking and team visibility, ensuring all tasks are documented in one place.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** node in n8n.
2. Add a **Todoist node** to fetch tasks with a specific label.
3. Insert a **Notion node** to create entries in a chosen database.
4. Add another **Todoist node** to update the original task label after syncing.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that syncs tasks from Todoist to a Google Sheets document instead of Notion. Test it by adding tasks with the label "sync" and verify they appear in Sheets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you save time and improve task management for clients, allowing you to offer valuable automation services that enhance productivity and organization, ultimately increasing your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On schedule" and "Replace label on task" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
