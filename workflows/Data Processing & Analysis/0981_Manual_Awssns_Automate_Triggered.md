# Manual AWSSNS Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, awsSns.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: AWS SNS (awsSns)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending a message to an AWS SNS topic whenever a manual trigger is executed. It's a simple way to send notifications or alerts without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to alert their team via SMS or email when a critical event occurs, like a server outage. By automating notifications, they can respond faster and minimize downtime.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Add an "AWS SNS" node, configuring it with your AWS credentials and desired topic.
4. Connect the "Manual Trigger" to the "AWS SNS" node.
5. Execute the workflow to send a test message to your SNS topic.

### Practice
Try modifying the message and subject in the AWS SNS node to see how it affects the notifications. Experiment with different topics to understand how messages are categorized in AWS SNS.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate critical notifications, improving response times and operational efficiency. This skill can attract clients looking to streamline their communication processes, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "AWS SNS" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
