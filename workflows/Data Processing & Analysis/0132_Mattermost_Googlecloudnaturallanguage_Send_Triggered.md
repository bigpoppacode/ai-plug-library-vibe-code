### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform trigger for collecting feedback.
2. Use Google Cloud Natural Language to analyze the submitted feedback.
3. Implement an IF condition to check sentiment score.
4. Send a message to Mattermost if the score meets a specific threshold.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it functions as intended.

### Practice
Create a small feedback form using Typeform. Set up the workflow to analyze a few sample responses and send the results to a personal Mattermost channel. Experiment with different feedback to see how sentiment analysis changes.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
