This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, googleSheets, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Google Sheets2 (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set1 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Google Sheets1 (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Google Sheets (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data handling with Google Sheets. It starts when triggered manually, retrieves data from a specified Google Sheet, processes it by adding or updating values, and appends new data back into another Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to manage rental properties. It can automatically update rent prices and append new tenant information to a Google Sheet, saving time and reducing errors in data entry.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Google Sheets** node to read data (set the sheet ID and range).
4. Use a **Set** node to modify data (like increasing rent).
5. Add another **Google Sheets** node to update or append the modified data.
6. Execute the workflow.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow to track expenses. Set up a Google Sheet with expense categories, then automate the process of adding new expenses with a manual trigger to see how data flows through the nodes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions, ultimately generating income through service offerings or consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
