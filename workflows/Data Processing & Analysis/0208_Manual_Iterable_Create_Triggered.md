# Manual Iterable Create Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, iterable.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Iterable (iterable)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Iterable1 (iterable)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Iterable2 (iterable)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates user management within Iterable by allowing you to create, update, and retrieve user information based on an email identifier. It starts when you manually trigger it, processes user data, and performs actions in Iterable.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to manage user subscriptions in an email marketing platform. For example, a consultant could automate user data updates after a client signs up, ensuring their marketing lists are always up-to-date without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add an **Iterable** node to create or update user data, linking it to the email parameter.
4. Connect another **Iterable** node to retrieve user details after creation.
5. Save and execute the workflow to see how it functions.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include an additional step that sends a confirmation email after creating or updating a user in Iterable. This will help you understand how to integrate more actions into your automation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you streamline user management for clients, saving them time and reducing errors. This skill can be a selling point for your automation services, enabling you to attract more customers and generate higher income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Iterable2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
