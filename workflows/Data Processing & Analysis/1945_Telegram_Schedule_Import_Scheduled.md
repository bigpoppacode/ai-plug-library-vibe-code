## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching open GitHub issues from a specified repository every 10 minutes. It checks for issues with fewer than 5 comments, extracts relevant details, and sends a message via Telegram about new issues.

### Demonstrate
A project manager can use this workflow to monitor GitHub issues for their team's project. Instead of manually checking for updates, they receive instant Telegram notifications about relevant issues, allowing for quicker responses and better project management.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your GitHub and Telegram credentials.
3. Edit the GitHub node to specify your repository owner and name.
4. Adjust the comment filter in the Check for comments node if needed.
5. Run the workflow and watch it fetch issues every 10 minutes.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that retrieves open issues from a different GitHub repository and sends updates to your email instead of Telegram. Experiment with different filters, like changing the comment threshold.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate project monitoring, saving time and improving responsiveness. This skill can attract clients who need efficient issue tracking, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Get Github Issues" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
