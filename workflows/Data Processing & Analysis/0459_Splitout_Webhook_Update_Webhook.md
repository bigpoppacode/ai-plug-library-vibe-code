## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reviewing code changes in GitLab. When a merge request is made, it checks if a review is needed, retrieves code changes, and uses AI to analyze and provide feedback on the changes, posting the results back into GitLab.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to streamline code reviews. Instead of manually reviewing every change, the workflow automatically checks for changes, analyzes them with AI, and posts feedback, saving time and ensuring consistent quality in code reviews.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Configure the webhook to trigger on GitLab merge requests.
3. Set up your GitLab API credentials in the HTTP Request nodes.
4. Customize the AI prompts to match your review criteria.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a merge request in GitLab.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that only checks for code changes without AI analysis. Trigger it with a manual node and log the changes in a Google Sheet or send an email with the details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate code reviews, which can attract clients looking for efficient development processes. This skill can lead to offering automation as a service, generating income while improving software quality for clients.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Post Discussions" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
