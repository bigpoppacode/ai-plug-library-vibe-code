## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing customer feedback. When feedback is submitted via Typeform, the workflow detects the sentiment using AWS Comprehend. If the sentiment is negative, it sends a notification to Mattermost with the feedback details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically monitor customer feedback from events. If a participant submits negative feedback, the owner is instantly notified, allowing quick resolution and improved customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform to collect feedback.
2. Create a new n8n workflow and add a Typeform Trigger node.
3. Add an AWS Comprehend node to analyze sentiment.
4. Use an IF node to check if the sentiment is negative.
5. Connect a Mattermost node to send notifications for negative feedback.

### Practice
Create a simple feedback form using Typeform. Set up the workflow to notify you via email instead of Mattermost when negative feedback is detected. Test it by submitting both positive and negative responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you provide valuable insights to businesses, enhancing customer interactions and potentially generating income by offering automation services that improve customer feedback management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Mattermost" and "Typeform Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
