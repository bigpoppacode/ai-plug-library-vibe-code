## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing customer feedback from Typeform, determining its sentiment using Google Cloud Natural Language, and sending a notification about the feedback via Mattermost.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline feedback collection and response. For example, after an event, they collect attendee feedback, analyze sentiments, and notify the team of urgent issues, improving customer relations.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a Typeform Trigger to collect feedback.
3. Use Google Cloud Natural Language to analyze sentiment.
4. Add an IF node to check sentiment score.
5. If positive, send a message via Mattermost; otherwise, do nothing.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the Typeform questions and the sentiment threshold in the IF node. Test the workflow with different feedback inputs to see how it reacts and ensure it sends the correct notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate feedback analysis, saving time and improving customer engagement. This skill can attract clients seeking efficient automation solutions, enhancing your service offerings and revenue potential.

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Typeform Trigger" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
