## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow extracts and decodes URLs from Google News RSS feeds, transforming them into clean article links. It automates the process of fetching news articles and preparing them for further use, like sharing or analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate the collection of daily news articles relevant to their industry, allowing them to quickly curate content for newsletters or social media without manually sifting through feeds.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Use the RSS Feed Read node to fetch news from Google News.
4. Add nodes to decode URLs and extract necessary data.
5. Aggregate the results and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the RSS feed URL to target a different news source. See how the changes affect the output and refine the decoding steps accordingly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable automation services, enabling clients to save time and improve their content curation. This could lead to new business opportunities and increased income as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Aggregate results in a single object" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
