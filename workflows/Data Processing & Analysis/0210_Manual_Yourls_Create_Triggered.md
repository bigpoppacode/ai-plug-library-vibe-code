## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow creates a short URL from a long link and retrieves its statistics. It starts when you manually trigger it, shortens the given URL using the Yourls service, and then fetches statistics for that shortened URL.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to shorten links for marketing campaigns, making them more shareable. After shortening, they can track click statistics to gauge user engagement, helping them optimize future campaigns.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Yourls** node to shorten a specific long URL.
4. Connect a second **Yourls** node to retrieve statistics for the shortened URL.
5. Execute the workflow and observe the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the long URL in the Yourls node to a link of your choice. Execute the workflow and check the output for the shortened URL and its statistics. See how changing the URL affects the statistics fetched.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate link shortening and tracking, which can enhance marketing efforts. This skill can help you attract clients seeking efficient ways to manage and analyze their online presence, potentially increasing your income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Yourls1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
