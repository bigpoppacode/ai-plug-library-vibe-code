### Explain
This n8n workflow automates monitoring a website's uptime using UptimeRobot. It creates a monitor, updates its friendly name, and retrieves its status, ensuring the website is always operational.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically check their website's uptime. If the site goes down, they receive alerts, allowing them to respond quickly and maintain customer trust.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a UptimeRobot node to create a monitor for your website.
3. Add another UptimeRobot node to update the monitor's name.
4. Include a third UptimeRobot node to retrieve the monitor's status.
5. Connect the nodes and test the workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow by monitoring a personal blog or project site. Set it to alert you via email if the site goes down, and observe how the automation works in real-time.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enhances your automation skills, enabling you to offer uptime monitoring services. This can attract clients looking for reliable web management, ultimately generating income through automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
