## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the generation of SEO seed keywords using an AI model based on an ideal customer profile (ICP). It takes inputs about the customer's product, pain points, goals, and current solutions, processes this information through an AI node, and outputs a list of relevant keywords.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly generate targeted SEO keywords for their new SaaS product, ensuring their marketing efforts are focused on terms that resonate with their ideal customer, improving online visibility and driving traffic.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) by filling in the required fields.
3. Connect your AI API (OpenAI/Anthropic) in the designated node.
4. Execute the workflow to generate a list of seed keywords based on your ICP.
5. Review and utilize the output for your SEO strategy.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the inputs for different customer profiles and see how the generated keywords vary. Experiment with different AI models if available to compare results.

### WIIFM

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
