## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically checks an RSS feed every 5 minutes, extracts new articles with images, and filters the data for relevant information like titles, authors, and URLs. It ensures only new content is processed to keep updates efficient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor tech news articles from a specific RSS feed. By automating the collection and filtering of articles, they can quickly share relevant updates with their team or audience, enhancing their content strategy without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron** node to set a schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes).
3. Add an **RSS Feed Read** node and input your desired RSS feed URL.
4. Use a **Set** node to filter and format the data (title, author, link).
5. Add a **Function** node to check for new articles based on dates or IDs.
6. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to pull articles from a different RSS feed or to extract additional data fields, such as publication dates or content snippets. Check the output to ensure it only captures new entries.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content curation, saving you time and increasing your value to clients. By offering automated updates, you can enhance engagement and position yourself as a knowledgeable resource in your industry.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Only get new RSS1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
