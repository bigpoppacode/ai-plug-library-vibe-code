## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering product deals from the MediaMarkt website, generating an email with those deals, and notifying users who fill out a form with their email preferences.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically send personalized deal alerts to customers based on their preferred categories, enhancing engagement and driving sales without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Set up a form to collect user email and deal preferences.
2. Use a Webhook node to trigger the workflow on form submission.
3. Configure the nodes to scrape MediaMarkt offers, generate an email, and send it to users.
4. Test the workflow to ensure users receive the correct emails.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new category, like "Laptops." Update the scraping and email generation nodes to reflect this change, then test it to see if users receive updates on this new category.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email marketing services, creating value for clients by saving them time and improving customer engagement, ultimately leading to increased sales and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
