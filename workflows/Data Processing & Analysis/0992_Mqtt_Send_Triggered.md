# MQTT Send Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving mqttTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **MQTT Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: MQTT Trigger (mqttTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow captures messages from an MQTT queue, allowing for automation based on incoming data. It triggers actions when messages are received, making it useful for IoT applications or real-time data processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to receive real-time alerts from IoT sensors in a warehouse, triggering actions like inventory updates or alerts for low stock levels, thus optimizing operations.

### Imitate
1. Set up an MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto).
2. Import this workflow into n8n.
3. Configure the MQTT Trigger node with your broker's credentials.
4. Define actions to be taken when messages are received.
5. Test the workflow by publishing a message to the MQTT topic.

### Practice
Create a test MQTT message using a tool like MQTT.fx or the MQTT Explorer. Publish a message and observe how the n8n workflow responds, ensuring it triggers the defined actions based on the incoming data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate real-time data processing, adding value to businesses by improving efficiency and responsiveness. This skill can attract clients looking for IoT solutions and enhance your automation service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "MQTT Trigger" and "MQTT Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
