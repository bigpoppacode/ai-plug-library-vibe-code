# Manual Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Mock data (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Summing function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of summing amounts from mock data after a manual trigger. When executed, it generates mock financial data (USD amounts) and calculates the total, helping users visualize simple data operations.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly generate and sum sales data for a daily report. Instead of manually tracking sales, they automate the process to save time and ensure accuracy in financial reporting.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Function** node for mock data: return an array with amounts.
4. Add another **Function** node to sum the amounts.
5. Connect nodes in sequence and execute the workflow to see results.

### Practice
Try modifying the mock data in the second step to include different amounts. Execute the workflow again to see how it affects the total sum calculated by the third node.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enhances your automation skills, enabling you to create valuable data processing tools for businesses. This could help you attract clients, increase operational efficiency, and open new revenue streams in automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Summing function" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
