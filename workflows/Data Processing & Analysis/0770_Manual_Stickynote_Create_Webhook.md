## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates video generation using the HeyGen platform. When triggered, it sets parameters for video creation (like avatar and voice), waits for processing, checks the video status, and outputs the final video URL.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create personalized marketing videos quickly. For example, an online course creator could generate welcome videos for new students, saving time and enhancing engagement.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Use the Set node to define video parameters (avatar ID, voice ID, text).
4. Add an HTTP Request node to call the HeyGen API for video creation.
5. Implement a Wait node to allow processing time.
6. Add another HTTP Request node to check the video status.
7. Output the final video URL.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that generates a text-based video using a static avatar and voice. Experiment with different text inputs and observe how the generated video changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer video creation services, enhancing client engagement through personalized content. This can attract new customers and generate income as part of your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Get Video Status" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
