### Explain
This n8n workflow automates activities related to Strava. It allows users to create a new running activity, update its description, and retrieve details about that activity, all triggered by a manual execution.

### Demonstrate
A fitness consultant might use this workflow to log client running sessions in Strava automatically, ensuring each session is recorded with details and updates without manual entry, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Strava** node to create an activity with necessary details.
4. Add a second **Strava** node to update the activity with a description.
5. Add a third **Strava** node to retrieve the activity details.
6. Connect the nodes sequentially and save the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log different types of activities (like cycling or swimming) in Strava. Change the parameters in the Strava nodes and test to see if it correctly logs the new activity type.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to fitness professionals, allowing them to save time on manual logging and focus more on training clients, thus creating a potential revenue stream for your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Strava2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
