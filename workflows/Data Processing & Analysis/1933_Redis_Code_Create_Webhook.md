# Redis Code Create Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving scheduleTrigger, code, redis.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Add Filterable Parameter (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Query Database (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Filter Out Tickets that have already been sent (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get New Tickets (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Combine like Companies (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Teams to Dispatch (microsoftTeams)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Log in Redis (redis)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending alerts about new tickets. It retrieves new tickets from a database, checks if they have been sent before, groups them by company, and sends notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to improve customer support efficiency. For example, an IT service provider could automatically alert the dispatch team of new support tickets, ensuring timely responses and better customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** to run at specific times.
2. Use a **Code node** to prepare ticket data.
3. Query a **Redis database** to check previously sent tickets.
4. Use an **HTTP Request node** to fetch new tickets from an API.
5. Combine tickets by company using another **Code node**.
6. Send alerts to Microsoft Teams with a **Teams node**.
7. Log ticket IDs in Redis to prevent duplicates.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow that only fetches new tickets and sends a notification to yourself via email. Test it to see if you receive alerts for new tickets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline ticket management, potentially leading to faster response times and improved customer satisfaction, making it a valuable service for businesses looking to enhance their support operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Log in Redis" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
