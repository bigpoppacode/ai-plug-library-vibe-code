18. **Step 17: Merge Injections (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup of Squarespace code injections to GitHub. It retrieves the header and footer code from a Squarespace site, cleans it up, and then saves it to a specified GitHub repository in an organized manner.

### Demonstrate
A web developer maintaining a Squarespace site could use this workflow to ensure that any custom code changes to headers and footers are backed up regularly to GitHub, safeguarding against accidental loss or changes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the Squarespace URL in the "Get Squarespace data" node.
3. Configure the GitHub credentials in the "Edit Injection data" and "Create Injection data" nodes.
4. Adjust the "Globals" node with your GitHub repository information.
5. Execute the workflow manually or set a schedule.

### Practice
Create a test Squarespace site and modify its header/footer. Run the workflow to back up the code to your GitHub. Check if the changes are reflected in your repository to confirm it's working.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate routine backups, reducing the risk of data loss. This skill can attract clients needing reliable website maintenance, positioning you as a valuable automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Merge Injections" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
