## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates syncing scheduled events from Discord to Google Calendar. It retrieves scheduled events from a Discord server, checks if they exist in Google Calendar, updates them if they do, or creates new ones if they don't.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with a Discord server can use this workflow to ensure all scheduled events are automatically reflected in their Google Calendar, enhancing organization and preventing missed events, thus improving team coordination.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Discord bot and obtain its token.
2. Create a new n8n workflow and add a **Schedule Trigger**.
3. Use the **HTTP Request** node to list scheduled events from Discord.
4. Add a **Google Calendar** node to check for existing events.
5. Use an **IF** node to decide whether to update or create an event.
6. Map fields and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the schedule frequency or adding a notification step to alert your team via email when new events are created in Google Calendar.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to clients, enhancing their productivity and organization. This skill can help you attract more customers and create a sustainable income stream through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "List scheduled events from Discord" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
