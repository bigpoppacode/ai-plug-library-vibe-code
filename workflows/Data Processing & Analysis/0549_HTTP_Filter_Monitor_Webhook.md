## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data processing by retrieving the latest Stripe checkout sessions, filtering them based on custom fields, and organizing the data for easier visualization. It enhances efficiency in managing customer transactions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze customer checkout data from Stripe, enabling them to track sales trends and customer preferences without manual data entry, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Stripe API credentials.
3. Customize the date range in the Stripe node to fit your needs.
4. Define the custom fields you want to filter.
5. Execute the workflow and visualize the results.

### Practice
Create a test Stripe account and simulate a few checkout sessions. Run the workflow to see how it processes the data, ensuring you adjust the custom fields and date ranges to match your test data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate tedious data management tasks, providing value to potential clients by saving them time and improving their data insights, which can lead to increased sales and customer satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "split custom_fields" and "split all data" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
