### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of taking a screenshot of a website whenever a new row is added to a Google Sheet. It captures the URL from the row, takes a screenshot, and then saves that screenshot to Google Drive, streamlining web monitoring or documentation tasks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically capture and store screenshots of competitor websites whenever they add a new URL to their Google Sheet. This helps in tracking changes over time without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with a column for URLs.
2. Create a new n8n workflow with a Google Sheets Trigger for new rows.
3. Add a Website Screenshot node to take screenshots of the URLs.
4. Connect a Google Drive node to save the screenshots.
5. Test by adding URLs to the Google Sheet.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to take screenshots of a different website or save the images in a subfolder within Google Drive. Experiment with different URLs to see how the workflow responds.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
