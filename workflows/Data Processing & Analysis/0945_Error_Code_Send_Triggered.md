# Error Code Send Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving errorTrigger, lmChatOpenAi, outputParserStructured.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Error Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Error Trigger (errorTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

9. **Step 8: Get Failed Exec (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Extract Error Details (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Error Solver Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Set Diagnosis Fields (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

14. **Step 13: Generate Email (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates error handling by triggering on workflow failures, using OpenAI to analyze the error, and sending detailed diagnostic emails. It helps users quickly understand and resolve errors in their automations.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically notify their team about errors in their automated processes. For instance, if an online order processing workflow fails, this system immediately sends an email with error details, saving time and minimizing disruptions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Error Trigger to monitor your workflows.
3. Configure the OpenAI Chat Model with your API key.
4. Customize email settings in the SET EMAIL node (your email, CC, BCC).
5. Test by deliberately causing an error in a monitored workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that intentionally fails (e.g., a missing API call) and observe how the error handling workflow sends an email with the error details. Modify the email content to better suit your business's needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to enhance operational reliability, providing quick resolutions to automation issues. This skill not only increases your value as an automation consultant but can also attract more clients by showcasing your ability to maintain seamless business operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Error Trigger" and "Generate Email" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
