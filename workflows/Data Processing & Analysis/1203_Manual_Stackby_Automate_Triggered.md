# Manual Stackby Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, stackby.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Stackby (stackby)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Stackby1 (stackby)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where, upon execution, it sets specific values (like ID and Name), sends these to a Stackby table, and then retrieves a list from that table for further use or analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically log new customer data into a Stackby database whenever a new customer signs up, ensuring data is organized without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define values like ID and Name.
4. Connect a **Stackby** node to add these values to a specific table.
5. Add another **Stackby** node to list the entries from the table.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new value (like Customer Email) in the **Set** node and ensure it logs into Stackby. Test the workflow by executing it and checking the Stackby table for the new entry.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data management tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients needing custom automation solutions, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Stackby1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
