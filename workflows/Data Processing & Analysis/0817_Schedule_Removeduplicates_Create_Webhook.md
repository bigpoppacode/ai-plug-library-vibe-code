## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates monitoring changes on a specific webpage. It checks the page at scheduled intervals, generates a hash of the content to detect changes, notifies users via email if updates are found, and logs the changes in Google Sheets and Google Drive.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to track competitor website updates (e.g., changes in terms of service). By automating the monitoring, they can receive timely notifications and keep their own policies up-to-date without manually checking the site.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new n8n workflow and add a **Schedule Trigger**.
2. Use the **HTTP Request** node to fetch the webpage content.
3. Implement the **Crypto** node to generate a hash of the content.
4. Add a **Remove Duplicates** node to filter out previously seen hashes.
5. Use **Gmail** to notify changes and **Google Sheets** to log them.
6. Test the workflow with a URL of your choice.

### Practice
Try modifying the URL in the **Variables** node to monitor a different webpage. Observe how the workflow captures changes over time and sends notifications when updates occur. 

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients seeking to stay informed on competitors or regulatory changes, potentially leading to new business opportunities and increased income as part of your AI automation offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
