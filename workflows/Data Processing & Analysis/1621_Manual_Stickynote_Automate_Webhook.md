1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set Params (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Clean Output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user can manually trigger an action, set parameters for an AI request, send the request to an AI service, and then clean and present the output. It's designed for tasks like retrieving AI-generated responses based on specific prompts.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer inquiries. For example, when customers ask about product differences, the workflow collects their questions and retrieves AI-generated answers, saving time and enhancing responsiveness.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define parameters (e.g., system and user prompts).
4. Use an **HTTP Request** node to send these parameters to an AI service.
5. Add a **Set** node to clean the output.
6. Finish with a **Sticky Note** for reminders or instructions.

### Practice
Try creating a simple workflow that takes a user question, sends it to an AI API like OpenAI, and returns the answer. Use the manual trigger to execute the workflow and see how it processes the input and generates a response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows students to automate responses to common inquiries, increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction. This skill can help them sell automation services, attract clients, and generate income through streamlined operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
