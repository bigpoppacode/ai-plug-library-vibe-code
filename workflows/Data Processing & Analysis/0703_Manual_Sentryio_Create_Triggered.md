# Manual SentryIo Create Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, sentryIo.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sentry.io (sentryIo)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sentry.io1 (sentryIo)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a release in Sentry.io and retrieving all existing releases. It starts with a manual trigger, then creates a new release, and finally fetches all releases, streamlining software version tracking.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to automate release tracking. Instead of manually creating releases in Sentry after each deployment, they can trigger this workflow to log the new release and view all previous ones, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Sentry.io** node to create a release; configure project details.
4. Add another **Sentry.io** node to fetch all releases.
5. Connect the nodes: trigger → create release → get all releases.
6. Execute the workflow to test.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the release version or project parameters in the Sentry node. Execute the workflow multiple times with different inputs to see how it handles versioning and tracks changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline release management in software projects, increasing efficiency. This skill can attract clients seeking automation solutions, helping you build a profitable AI automation business focused on software development.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Sentry.io1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
