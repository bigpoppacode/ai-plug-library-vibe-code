# Send Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving chatTrigger, agent, mcpClientTool.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: n8n Research AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: n8n-assistant Tool Lookup (mcpClientTool)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: n8n-assistant Execute Tool (mcpClientTool)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: OpenAI Chat Model2 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates responses to chat messages. When a message is received, it triggers an AI agent that retrieves relevant tools and content from the n8n Multi-Channel Platform, executes tasks, and generates a tailored response using OpenAI's language model.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support. When a customer sends a chat message, the workflow analyzes their query, retrieves relevant information, and responds instantly, improving customer satisfaction and reducing response time.

### Imitate
1. Set up a chatTrigger node to listen for incoming messages.
2. Add an AI agent node to process the message.
3. Use an MCP tool lookup node to find relevant tools/content.
4. Execute the tool with the required parameters.
5. Finally, use the OpenAI node to generate a response and send it back.

### Practice
Create a mini version of this workflow. Set up a simple chat trigger and configure it to respond with a static message. Gradually add complexity by integrating AI responses or retrieving information from a database.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide automated customer support solutions, saving businesses time and enhancing user experience. This skill can help you attract clients looking to streamline their operations, increasing your income potential as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "OpenAI Chat Model2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
