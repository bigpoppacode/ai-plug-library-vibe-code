4. Add another **Airtable** node to update records with image attachments.
5. Include a **Sticky Note** node for instructions.
6. Link the nodes and configure parameters.
7. Execute the workflow to see it in action.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new text field in Airtable. Update the workflow to fetch and display this new field alongside the images. This will enhance your understanding of data manipulation within n8n.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
