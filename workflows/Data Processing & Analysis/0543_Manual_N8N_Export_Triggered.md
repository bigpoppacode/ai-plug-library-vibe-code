# Manual N8n Export Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Map Workflows & Credentials (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Save to Database (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Chat Trigger (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Query Workflow Credentials Database (toolCode)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Window Buffer Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Workflow Credentials Helper Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: n8n (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing and querying workflow credentials. It starts with a manual trigger, saves workflow details to a database, and uses an AI agent to allow users to ask about specific workflows and their credentials.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly find out which workflows are using specific credentials (like Slack or Google Sheets) without manually searching through each one, saving time and increasing efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Use the Set node to define workflow properties.
4. Save workflow details using a Code node to a SQLite database.
5. Set up an AI agent to query the saved data based on user input.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with different queries to see how the AI agent responds. Experiment by adding new workflows with different credentials and check if the AI can correctly identify them.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate the management of workflow credentials, making it easier to provide insights to clients. This skill can help you attract more customers and generate income by offering valuable automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "n8n" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
