# Manual Code Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, code, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sample data (name + language) (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sample data (greeting + language) (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Merge (name + language + greeting) (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging sample data, specifically names and greetings in different languages. It triggers manually, collects sample data, and combines it based on the language for personalized greetings.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically greet users in their preferred language when they submit a form. For example, a multilingual website can enhance user experience by personalizing messages based on user input.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Include two **Code** nodes to generate sample data for names and greetings.
4. Add a **Merge** node to combine the data based on language.
5. Test the workflow by clicking "Execute."

### Practice
Try modifying the sample data in the Code nodes to include additional languages or greetings. Run the workflow and see how the output changes based on your modifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to create personalized customer interactions, which can significantly enhance user engagement. This skill can be monetized by offering tailored automation services to businesses looking to improve their customer communication strategies.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Merge (name + language + greeting)" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
