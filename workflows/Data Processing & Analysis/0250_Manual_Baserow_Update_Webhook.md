### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching stock data, processing it, and sending an investment report via email. It begins with a manual trigger or a cron job, retrieves stock information from a website, formats it, calculates changes, and sends an HTML email summary.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically monitor stock investments. By scheduling daily reports, they can stay updated on their portfolio’s performance without manual checks, saving time and ensuring timely decisions.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual or cron trigger in n8n.
2. Connect to Baserow to retrieve investment data.
3. Use an HTTP Request node to fetch stock data from a website.
4. Parse the HTML response to extract relevant stock info.
5. Format the data into an HTML table.
6. Calculate changes in investment value.
7. Send the email report using SendGrid.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include an additional stock or change the email format. Execute the workflow and check if the email reflects the new changes accurately, reinforcing your understanding of node connections and data flow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable automation services to clients, helping them save time and make informed investment decisions. This skill can attract more customers and generate income, as businesses increasingly seek efficient solutions for financial management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "SendGrid" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
