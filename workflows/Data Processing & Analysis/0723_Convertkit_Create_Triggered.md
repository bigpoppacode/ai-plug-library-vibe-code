### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up the ConvertKit Trigger with your API credentials.
3. Customize the actions (like sending emails) to suit your business needs.
4. Test the workflow by adding a subscriber through your ConvertKit form.

### Practice
Create a test form in ConvertKit and subscribe using a test email. Observe how the workflow activates and check if the follow-up actions execute as expected, such as sending notification emails or logging the event.

Mastering this workflow allows you to automate your email marketing, saving time and ensuring no new subscriber is overlooked. This skill can help you attract more customers, improve engagement, and potentially increase sales, making it a valuable asset for your automation business.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
