# Splitout Executecommand Automate Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving set, manualTrigger, splitOut.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **trigger_manual** node.
2. **Step 1: libraries_set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: trigger_manual (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: libraries_array (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: libraries_split (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: library_install (executeCommand)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: trigger_schedule (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: trigger_instance (n8nTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the installation of specified libraries (like axios and cheerio) using a manual trigger or scheduled events. It sets up an array of libraries, splits them for individual processing, and installs each library through a command if it is not already installed.

### Demonstrate
A consultant might use this workflow to quickly set up a development environment for a client project. Instead of manually installing libraries one by one, they can trigger this workflow to automate the installation process, saving time and reducing setup errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Set** node to define the libraries you want to install (e.g., axios, cheerio).
4. Use another **Set** node to convert the libraries string into an array.
5. Add a **Split Out** node to process each library individually.
6. Use an **Execute Command** node to run the installation command for each library.
7. Test the workflow by manually triggering it or scheduling it.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to install different libraries. Change the library names in the **Set** node and test the workflow. Ensure that the new libraries are correctly installed by checking your project directory.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline library management for software projects, making you more efficient. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, enabling you to offer valuable services and potentially increase your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "libraries_set" and "trigger_instance" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
