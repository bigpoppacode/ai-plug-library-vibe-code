## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks if a TRON wallet address is blacklisted via a Telegram bot. When a user sends a wallet address in a Telegram message, it validates the format, queries an API, and replies with whether the address is blacklisted or not.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to quickly verify wallet addresses for cryptocurrency transactions, ensuring they don't interact with blacklisted wallets, thus protecting their assets and reputation.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Telegram Trigger node to listen for messages.
3. Include an If node to validate the wallet address format.
4. Use an HTTP Request node to call the TRON blacklist API.
5. Add a Code node to process the API response.
6. Use a Telegram Send Message node to reply to the user with the result.

### Practice
Try sending different wallet addresses through your Telegram bot. Test both valid and invalid formats to see how the workflow responds. Adjust the error messages or add logging to enhance functionality.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer cryptocurrency-related tools, providing value to clients who need wallet verification services, thus creating a potential revenue stream in the growing crypto market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Telegram Trigger" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
