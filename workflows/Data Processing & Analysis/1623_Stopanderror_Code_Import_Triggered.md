3. **Step 2: GitHub (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Extract from File (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: setVars (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: replace variables (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: If (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Check All Prompt Vars Present (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: SetPrompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Stop and Error (stopAndError)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Set Completed Prompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Prompt Output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Ollama Chat Model (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of loading prompts from a GitHub repository, extracting and replacing variables in the prompts, checking for completeness, and passing the final prompt to an AI agent for processing. It allows users to streamline content generation by automating data retrieval and transformation.

### Demonstrate
A marketing consultant could use this workflow to automatically pull content prompts from a GitHub repo for social media campaigns. Instead of manually updating prompts, the workflow ensures that all variables are filled and the AI generates tailored content, saving time and enhancing creativity.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install and launch n8n.
2. **Create a New Workflow**: Start with a manual trigger.
3. **Add GitHub Node**: Configure it to pull files from your GitHub repo.
4. **Extract Content**: Use the "Extract from File" node to get text.
5. **Set Variables**: Define variables for dynamic content.
6. **Replace Variables**: Add a code node to replace placeholders in the text.
7. **Check Variables**: Implement an if-node to ensure all variables are present.
8. **Send to AI Agent**: Pass the final prompt to an AI agent.
9. **Test the Workflow**: Run the workflow to ensure it functions as expected.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to pull prompts from a different GitHub repository or change the variables to reflect a new project. Experiment with different AI models to see how the outputs vary. Document the changes and results for further insights.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services, saving clients time and enhancing their content strategies. It can lead to high-value contracts as businesses increasingly seek efficiency through automation, positioning you as a go-to expert in AI-driven processes.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Ollama Chat Model" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
