# Manual Postgres Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, postgres.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Postgres (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Postgres1 (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a PostgreSQL table and inserting data into it. It starts with a manual trigger, sets up initial data, creates a table named "test," and finally retrieves the data from that table.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to set up a database for tracking customer orders. Automating table creation and data insertion saves time, reduces errors, and ensures that the database is ready for immediate use after new orders come in.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node as the starting point.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define initial data (e.g., id and name).
4. Use a **Postgres** node to execute the SQL command for table creation.
5. Add another **Postgres** node to retrieve data from the newly created table.

### Practice
Try modifying the initial data in the **Set** node to include different fields (like email or address) and adjust the SQL commands in the **Postgres** nodes accordingly. Execute the workflow to see how it handles the new data structure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to efficiently manage databases with automation, which can attract clients needing database solutions. This skill can save businesses time and resources, making you a valuable asset in the automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Postgres1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
