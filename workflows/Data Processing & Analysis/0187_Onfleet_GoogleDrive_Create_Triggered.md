This n8n workflow automatically creates a task in Onfleet whenever a specific file in Google Drive is updated. It monitors changes to the file and responds by generating a new task in the Onfleet delivery management system.

### Demonstrate
A delivery service owner can use this workflow to automatically trigger a new delivery task whenever an order file is updated in Google Drive, ensuring timely and organized dispatching without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Google Drive Trigger** node to monitor a specific file.
3. Set the trigger to check for updates every minute.
4. Add an **Onfleet** node to create a task.
5. Connect the nodes and configure the Onfleet parameters for the task.
6. Test the workflow by updating the file in Google Drive.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to trigger a different action in Onfleet, such as updating an existing task instead of creating a new one, and see how it affects the workflow's behavior.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline operations for clients, saving them time and reducing errors. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and potentially higher income as you offer automation services.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
