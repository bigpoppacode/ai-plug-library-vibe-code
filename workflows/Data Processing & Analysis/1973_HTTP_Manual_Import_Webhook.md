## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates posting images to Instagram and TikTok. It retrieves two images, processes them (renaming and merging), and sends them as a single file to both platforms, streamlining social media content management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate social media marketing. For instance, a photographer could schedule posts for multiple platforms, saving time and ensuring consistent content delivery without manual uploads.

### Imitate
1. Import this workflow into n8n.
2. Replace image URLs with your own in the "Get Image" nodes.
3. Adjust the POST parameters (title, user) to match your social media needs.
4. Test the workflow to ensure images are uploaded correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a third image. Update the merging and posting steps to accommodate the extra image, and test the workflow to see if all three images are posted successfully.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services, helping businesses save time and improve their social media presence, ultimately increasing your marketability and potential income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "POST TO INSTAGRAM1" and "Get Image 2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
