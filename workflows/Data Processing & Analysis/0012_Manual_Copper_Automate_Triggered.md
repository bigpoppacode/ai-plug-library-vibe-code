### Imitate
1. Set up a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
2. Add a **Copper node** to create a new person, entering their name and email.
3. Add a second **Copper node** to update the person’s phone number using their ID.
4. Add a third **Copper node** to retrieve and confirm the updated details.
5. Execute the workflow to test and adjust as needed.

### Practice

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
