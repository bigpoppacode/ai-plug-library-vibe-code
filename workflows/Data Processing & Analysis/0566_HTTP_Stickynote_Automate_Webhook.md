## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Query Confluence (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Return Tool Response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of receiving a query (like a password request), searching for relevant information in Confluence, and returning a structured response with the title, link, and content excerpt to the parent workflow.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically respond to customer password reset requests by querying a knowledge base (Confluence) for the relevant article, saving time and improving user experience.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a trigger (e.g., Webhook).
3. Configure the HTTP Request node to connect to your knowledge base API.
4. Adjust the response format in the Return Tool Response node.
5. Test the workflow by sending a sample query.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow where you manually input a query instead of using a trigger, and log the response in a Google Sheet to see how the data flows through the nodes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to build automated customer support systems, saving time and increasing efficiency. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, allowing you to generate income as a consultant or service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Execute Workflow Trigger" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
