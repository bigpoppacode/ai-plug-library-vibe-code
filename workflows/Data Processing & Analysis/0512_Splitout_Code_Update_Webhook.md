## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: get node types (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: If (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Aggregate (aggregate)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: extract name and latest version (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Summarize (summarize)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: get all workflows (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: prettify output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: instance base url (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: get single workflow (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: node names that needs update (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking node types in your n8n instance. It begins with a manual trigger, retrieves node types, checks for updates, and summarizes the results, helping users maintain their workflows efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to regularly check and update their automation tools without manually verifying each node. For instance, a marketing team could ensure their email automation nodes are up-to-date to avoid potential errors in campaigns.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the process.
3. Include an HTTP Request node to fetch node types from your n8n instance.
4. Use a Split Out node to handle multiple nodes efficiently.
5. Implement an If node to check for outdated nodes.
6. Use an Aggregate node to summarize the results.
7. Set up output formatting using the Set node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a notification step that alerts you via email or Slack whenever an outdated node is detected, ensuring you're always aware of necessary updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you streamline automation management, saving time and reducing errors. It positions you as a knowledgeable consultant who can offer valuable maintenance services, creating opportunities for recurring revenue and client retention.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "get node types" and "node names that needs update" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
