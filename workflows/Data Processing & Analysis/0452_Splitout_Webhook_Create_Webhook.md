### Explain

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly generate relevant keywords for their website's SEO strategy, saving time on research and improving visibility on search engines, which can lead to increased traffic and sales.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Webhook** node to receive keywords.
3. Use an **HTTP Request** node to query a keyword generation API.
4. Add **XML** and **Set** nodes to format and clean the keywords.
5. Use a **Respond to Webhook** node to return the cleaned keywords.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a different API for keyword generation. Change the API endpoint in the HTTP Request node and test the workflow with various search queries to see how the results differ.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
