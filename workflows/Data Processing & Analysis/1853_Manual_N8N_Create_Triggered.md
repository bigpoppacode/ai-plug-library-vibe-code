# Manual N8n Create Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, splitOut.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Services (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Google JSON (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Google Email (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: n8n Create Credentials (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of Google OAuth2 credentials for various Google services. It starts with a manual trigger, collects necessary data (like a Google JSON file and email), and processes this information to generate credentials for different Google services, streamlining the setup process.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly set up OAuth2 credentials for multiple Google services (like Google Sheets, Google Drive) for various applications, saving time and ensuring consistent credential management across projects.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use a **Set** node to input your Google JSON data and email.
4. Add a **Split Out** node to process each service.
5. Use a **Create Credentials** node to generate OAuth2 credentials.
6. Test the workflow to ensure credentials are created correctly.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the Google services listed in the **Set** node. Add or remove services to see how it affects the credential creation process and test it with different Google JSON configurations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you streamline the credential setup for Google services, allowing you to offer faster, more efficient automation solutions to clients, which can result in higher revenue and a competitive edge in the automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
