# Manual Send Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Extract domain name (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sample email (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting a domain name from a given email address. It starts when you manually trigger it, then takes a sample email, extracts the domain name, and prepares it for further use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to clean up and organize customer emails by extracting domain names for targeted marketing campaigns, ensuring they only reach relevant audiences.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define a sample email.
4. Add a **Function** node to extract the domain from the email.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the sample email in the **Set** node to test different email formats. Execute the workflow and observe how it extracts different domain names.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline data management for your business, making it easier to segment customers and create targeted marketing strategies, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer engagement.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Sample email" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
