2. Create an n8n workflow with a Typeform Trigger.
3. Add Google Cloud Natural Language to analyze feedback sentiment.
4. Use an IF node to filter positive responses.
5. Store feedback in Notion and send alerts to Slack.
6. Log data in Trello for tracking.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow. Use a Google Form instead of Typeform, analyze the input using a basic text sentiment analysis tool, and log results to a Google Sheet. Experiment with different feedback and observe how the workflow reacts.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
