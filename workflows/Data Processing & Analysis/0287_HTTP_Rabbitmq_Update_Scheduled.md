# HTTP Rabbitmq Update Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving rabbitmq, set, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **RabbitMQ** node.
2. **Step 1: RabbitMQ (rabbitmq)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow tracks the International Space Station's (ISS) position every minute and sends updates to a RabbitMQ topic, allowing other systems to subscribe and receive real-time position information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to build a real-time tracking system for satellite positions. For example, a logistics company could integrate ISS tracking to optimize satellite communication for global shipping routes, enhancing operational efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron Node** set to trigger every minute.
3. Connect it to an **HTTP Request Node** to fetch the ISS position from the API.
4. Use a **Set Node** to structure the data (latitude, longitude, timestamp).
5. Finally, connect a **RabbitMQ Node** to send this data to the specified queue.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that fetches weather data instead of ISS position. Use a public weather API, set it to trigger every hour, and send the results to a Slack channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time data solutions to clients, enhancing their operational capabilities. This skill can attract new customers, improve service offerings, and potentially increase revenue streams through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "RabbitMQ" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
