Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Is new? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Do something here (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Mark Row as processed (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Read sheet (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set processed value (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking a Google Sheets document every 5 minutes to see if there are any new rows. If a row is new, it marks it as processed and updates the sheet, allowing for efficient data management without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically track customer responses in a Google Sheet. Instead of manually checking for new entries, the workflow processes them every 5 minutes, ensuring that no responses are missed and saving time.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Google Sheets - Read Sheet** node to fetch data.
4. Connect an **If Node** to check if the row is new.
5. If new, add a **Set Node** to mark it as processed.
6. Add a **Google Sheets - Update Row** node to update the processed row.
7. Set a **Cron Node** to trigger this workflow every 5 minutes.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with sample data. Run the workflow and add a new row to see if it gets processed automatically. Observe how the sheet updates based on the workflow's logic.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data management tasks, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, potentially increasing your income through service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Run every 5 minutes" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
