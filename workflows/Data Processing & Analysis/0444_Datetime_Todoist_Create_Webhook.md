## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management by snoozing and unsnoozing tasks in Todoist based on their due dates, ensuring that tasks are only visible when they're relevant, thus helping users manage their workload effectively.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automate task management, ensuring that tasks due tomorrow reappear in their inbox for attention while snoozing less urgent tasks, thereby reducing overwhelm and improving focus on priority items.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Todoist account and connect it to n8n.
3. Change project IDs in the nodes to match your projects.
4. Adjust the snooze duration (currently set to 3 days) in the dateTime node.
5. Test by adding tasks with due dates to see them move between projects automatically.

### Practice
Create a new task in Todoist with a due date set for tomorrow. After running the workflow, verify that it has been moved back to the inbox. Experiment by changing the due date and observing how the workflow reacts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline task management, offering a valuable service to clients who need help organizing their workflows, which can lead to increased productivity and potential income through consulting or automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "if after unsnooze date" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
