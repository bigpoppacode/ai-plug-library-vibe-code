## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates GitHub issue management. It triggers when a new issue or comment is created. If an issue has no assignee, it assigns the creator. If a commenter requests to be assigned but the issue is already assigned, it notifies them.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing a GitHub project would use this workflow to streamline issue assignments. Instead of manually checking and assigning issues, it automatically assigns them based on user requests, saving time and ensuring accountability.

### Imitate
1. Set up a GitHub Trigger node to listen for new issues/comments.
2. Add a Switch node to differentiate between issue creation and comments.
3. Use IF nodes to check if an issue has an assignee and if comment requests are made.
4. Add GitHub nodes to assign users or add comments based on conditions.
5. Test the workflow with sample issues/comments on your GitHub repository.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository and implement the workflow. Create issues and comments to see how the automation assigns users and responds. Adjust conditions or messages to customize the behavior.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to enhance project management efficiency, attract clients needing automation in development processes, and create value by saving time and reducing manual errors in issue tracking.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Github Trigger" and "Assign Commenter" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
