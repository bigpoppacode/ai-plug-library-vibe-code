### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a Mattermost channel, adds a member to it, and posts a welcome message. It starts with a manual trigger and uses Mattermost nodes to perform these actions sequentially.

### Demonstrate

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Add a Mattermost node to create a channel (configure team ID and channel name).
4. Add another Mattermost node to add a user to the channel (specify user ID).
5. Finally, add a Mattermost node to post a welcome message in the channel.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the welcome message or adding more members to the channel. Test it by executing the workflow to see how it works with different configurations.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
