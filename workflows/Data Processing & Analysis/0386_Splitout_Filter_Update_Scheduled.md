### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of tracking TRC20 token transfers to a specified wallet. It retrieves recent transactions every 15 minutes, filters for relevant ones, and formats the data for further use, helping users keep track of their cryptocurrency activity.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to monitor their TRC20 wallet for incoming and outgoing transactions. This allows them to quickly respond to significant transfers, ensuring timely financial decisions and better cash flow management.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your TRC20 wallet address in the "Edit Fields" node.
3. Connect your n8n instance to the TronScan API.
4. Execute the workflow manually to test it.
5. Adjust the parameters as needed and schedule it to run every 15 minutes.

### Practice
Create a test wallet and run the workflow with dummy transactions. Observe how it filters and formats transaction data. Modify the wallet address and see how it affects the output, reinforcing your understanding of the nodes and their functions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable cryptocurrency tracking services to clients, enhancing your automation skills. It positions you as a knowledgeable consultant in the fast-growing crypto market, potentially leading to new revenue streams and clients.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Split Out" and "Aggregate" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
