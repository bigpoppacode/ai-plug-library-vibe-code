## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.

3. **Step 2: Intercom (intercom)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a new user in Intercom. When executed, it triggers a step that connects to Intercom, allowing you to add a user by specifying their email or identifier.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline onboarding by automatically adding new customers to their Intercom system when they sign up on a website, ensuring timely communication without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the **Intercom** node with your API credentials.
3. Adapt the identifier to match your user data (e.g., email).
4. Trigger the workflow manually to add a user.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to add a user with different identifiers (like phone number) and test it by executing the workflow with sample data to see how it integrates with Intercom.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate user management, saving time and reducing errors, which can attract clients looking for efficient solutions, ultimately helping you grow your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Intercom" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
