# Graphql Webhook Automate Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving graphql, function, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **GraphQL** node.
2. **Step 1: GraphQL (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow collects data via a webhook, queries country information based on a code using GraphQL, processes the response with JavaScript, and formats the result for output. It automates the retrieval of country details like name, phone, and emoji based on user input.

### Demonstrate
A travel agency could use this workflow to allow users to input a country code on their website, automatically fetching and displaying essential information about that country, enhancing user experience without manual lookup.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Webhook node to receive user input (country code).
3. Add a GraphQL node to query the country data using the input.
4. Use a Function node to process and format the response.
5. Add a Set node to structure the final output.
6. Test the workflow with different country codes.

### Practice
Set up a simple version of this workflow that only retrieves and displays country names based on a hardcoded country code. Test it with various codes to ensure it retrieves correct data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data retrieval processes for clients, improving their services while saving time and reducing errors. This skill makes you valuable in the growing field of automation, potentially increasing your income as a consultant or developer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "GraphQL" and "Webhook" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
