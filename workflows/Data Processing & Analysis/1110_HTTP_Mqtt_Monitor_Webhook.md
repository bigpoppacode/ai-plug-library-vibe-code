# HTTP MQTT Monitor Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, mqttTrigger, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Remote Sensor MQTT Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Remote Sensor MQTT Trigger (mqttTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Data ingest to InfluxDB bucket (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Payload data preparation node (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates remote IoT sensor monitoring. It triggers on MQTT messages from a DHT22 sensor, processes temperature and humidity data, and stores it in an InfluxDB database for analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with a greenhouse could use this workflow to monitor temperature and humidity in real-time. Automating data collection helps optimize plant care and improve yields without manual checks.

### Imitate
1. Set up an MQTT broker and connect it to your sensor.
2. Create a new n8n workflow with an MQTT Trigger node.
3. Add a Code node to format the incoming data.
4. Use an HTTP Request node to send data to an InfluxDB instance.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is logged correctly.

### Practice
Experiment by changing the sensor data format in the Code node. Send test data to the InfluxDB and verify how it appears in your database. This will reinforce understanding of data handling and logging.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer IoT data monitoring services, enhancing client operations with real-time insights. This can lead to improved efficiency, customer satisfaction, and potential revenue generation through automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Payload data preparation node" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
