# Manual Graphql Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, graphql.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: GraphQL (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow initiates with a manual trigger and then queries a GraphQL API to fetch data about past rocket launches, such as mission names, launch dates, and links. It automates data retrieval without manual input, streamlining the process.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically gather and display recent rocket launch data on their website. This saves time and ensures that visitors have access to the latest information without manual updates.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **GraphQL** node and configure it with the provided API endpoint and query.
4. Connect the nodes by linking the manual trigger to the GraphQL node.
5. Execute the workflow to fetch the data.

### Practice
Try modifying the GraphQL query to fetch different data (e.g., more details about rockets or launch sites). Execute the workflow and observe how the results change.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data retrieval tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency. This skill can attract customers looking for data-driven solutions, enhancing your value as an automation consultant or developer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "GraphQL" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
