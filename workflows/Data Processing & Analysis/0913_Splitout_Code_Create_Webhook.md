## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates web scraping by collecting URLs from Google Sheets, fetching data from those URLs using an API, processing the data with an AI model, and saving the structured results back to Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically gather product data from competitor websites, analyze it for insights, and log the findings in a Google Sheet for strategic decision-making.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the process.
3. Use the **Google Sheets** node to fetch URLs to scrape.
4. Add an **HTTP Request** node to scrape the data.
5. Process the data with the **AI model** node and extract insights.
6. Save results back to Google Sheets with another **Google Sheets** node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to scrape a different website and extract specific data points like product prices or reviews. Test it out with a small set of URLs to see how it performs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate data collection processes, enabling you to provide valuable market insights to clients, enhance your service offerings, or even create a new revenue stream by offering web scraping as a service.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "OpenRouter Chat Model" and "Split items" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
