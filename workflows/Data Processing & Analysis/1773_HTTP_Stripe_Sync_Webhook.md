# HTTP Stripe Sync Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stripeTrigger, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Stripe Trigger on Payment Event** node.
2. **Step 1: Stripe Trigger on Payment Event (stripeTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Extract Session Information (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Filter Information (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving customer and product information after a payment event in Stripe. When a payment is completed, it extracts session details and filters relevant information, such as customer name, email, and product purchased.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically capture customer details after a sale. For instance, when a customer buys a product online, this workflow collects their information to update a database or send a confirmation email, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Stripe Trigger to respond to `checkout.session.completed`.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to extract session information from Stripe's API.
4. Use a Set node to filter and assign customer details (name, email, product).
5. Test the workflow with a sample payment to ensure it captures the correct info.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that triggers on a different event, such as a new lead submission from a form. Modify the HTTP Request node to pull data from a different API and filter the information accordingly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate customer data management, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in your business operations. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, enabling you to generate income by offering these services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Stripe Trigger on Payment Event" and "Filter Information" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
