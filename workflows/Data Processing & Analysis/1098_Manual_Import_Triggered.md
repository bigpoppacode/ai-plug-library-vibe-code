# Manual Import Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Local Datetime (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of getting the current local date and time whenever a user manually triggers it. It collects the date and time details and formats them for easy use in future steps.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to log the exact time an event occurs (like a customer inquiry) to track response times or schedule follow-ups, ensuring timely customer service.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Function Node** to get the local datetime using the provided JavaScript code.
4. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the output.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log the datetime in a different format or add additional information (like the day of the week) to the output. Execute the workflow and verify the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate time-sensitive tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy in your operations. This skill can attract clients looking for reliable automation solutions, boosting your income potential in the automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Get Local Datetime" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
