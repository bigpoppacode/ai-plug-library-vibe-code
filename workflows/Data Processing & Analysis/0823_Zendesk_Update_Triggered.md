2. **Step 1: Zendesk Trigger (zendeskTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow triggers when a new support request is received in Zendesk. It allows businesses to automate their support process by responding to customer inquiries efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically log support requests from Zendesk into a Google Sheet, allowing for better tracking and analysis of customer issues without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Zendesk Trigger** node.
3. Connect it to a **Google Sheets** node to log requests.
4. Configure fields to capture necessary data (e.g., customer name, issue).
5. Test the workflow by submitting a request in Zendesk.

### Practice
Try setting up a similar workflow that logs incoming emails to a Google Sheet. Use a Gmail trigger to capture the email details and map them to the corresponding columns in the sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you streamline customer support processes, making your services more attractive to clients. Efficient support systems can lead to happier customers and increased retention, generating more income for your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
