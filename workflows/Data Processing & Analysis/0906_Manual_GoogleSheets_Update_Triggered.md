## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering and analyzing recent Reddit posts about business opportunities. It filters posts based on criteria like upvotes and content, summarizes them using AI, and saves the results to Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to identify valuable insights from Reddit discussions on entrepreneurship, saving time on manual research and enabling them to focus on actionable strategies for growth.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger to initiate the workflow.
3. Use the Reddit node to fetch posts from a relevant subreddit.
4. Filter the posts based on criteria (e.g., upvotes, keywords).
5. Summarize the filtered posts with an AI node.
6. Save the summarized results to Google Sheets.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to target a different subreddit or change the filtering criteria. After running the workflow, review the Google Sheet to see how the results differ based on your changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection and analysis, which can enhance your service offerings as a consultant or entrepreneur, helping you save time, gain insights, and potentially increase revenue through informed decision-making.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Edit Fields1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
