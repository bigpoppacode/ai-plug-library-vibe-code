## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring product prices from Zalando. It logs price history, updates product information, checks if prices fall below a specified alert, and sends email notifications about price reductions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to track prices of products they intend to sell. If they set an alert for a price drop, they can automatically receive emails when prices fall below their target, enabling timely purchasing decisions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Gmail accounts.
3. Customize the price alert thresholds and product links in the Google Sheets.
4. Set the schedule for how often to check the prices.
5. Test the workflow by adding a product link and price alert.

### Practice
Try modifying the price alert in the Google Sheets to see how the workflow reacts. Add a new product and set a different alert price to test email notifications for price drops.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, helping them save money and time. By effectively tracking prices, you can create a competitive advantage and generate income by providing tailored automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Add Log in History" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
