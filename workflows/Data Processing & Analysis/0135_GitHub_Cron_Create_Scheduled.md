# Github Cron Create Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving github, cron, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get latest release** node.
2. **Step 1: Get latest release (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: No issue for release? (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Create issue (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: List issues (gitlab)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking for new GitHub releases weekly. If no issues exist for a release, it creates one in GitLab, ensuring that updates are documented efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A software development team uses this workflow to ensure that every new release on GitHub is tracked in their GitLab issue tracker. This prevents oversight and keeps the team organized, improving project management.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Cron node to set a weekly schedule.
3. Use the GitHub node to fetch the latest release.
4. Add a Function node to check for existing GitLab issues.
5. If no issues exist, use the GitLab node to create a new issue.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it runs as expected.

### Practice
Set up the workflow to run manually instead of on a schedule. Trigger it and ensure it correctly identifies whether a GitHub release has existing issues in GitLab. Adjust the logic in the Function node to see how it affects outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide value to software teams by automating release tracking and documentation. This could lead to higher demand for your automation services, helping you secure clients and increase revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get latest release" and "List issues" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
