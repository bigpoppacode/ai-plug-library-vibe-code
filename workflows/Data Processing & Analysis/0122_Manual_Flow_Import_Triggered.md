# Manual Flow Import Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, flow.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Flow (flow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving all tasks from a project management tool, triggered by a manual click. It streamlines task management by enabling users to quickly access all tasks in one go.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly gather all project tasks before a team meeting, ensuring everyone is aligned on priorities and progress without manually checking each task list.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Flow** node to retrieve tasks.
4. Connect the **Manual Trigger** to the **Flow** node.
5. Execute the workflow to see all tasks retrieved.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to filter tasks by status (e.g., only retrieve completed tasks) and observe how the output changes. This will help reinforce your understanding of data retrieval and manipulation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to enhance efficiency in task management, making you more attractive to potential clients who need streamlined operations, ultimately leading to increased business opportunities and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Flow" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
