## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating a timesheet report. When triggered, it collects timesheet data, sorts it, creates a markdown report, and sends it via email, streamlining the reporting process.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to automatically compile weekly timesheet data from team members into a formatted report. This saves time and ensures timely delivery of reports to stakeholders.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Manual Trigger to start the process.
3. Use the GetTimesheetRecords function to input your own timesheet data.
4. Configure SortElements to sort by user and task.
5. Set up the email parameters in the Send Email node.
6. Execute the workflow to generate and send the report.

### Practice
Try modifying the GetTimesheetRecords function to include your own data. Execute the workflow and check the email to see how the report looks. Experiment with changing sorting fields or email content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive reporting tasks, freeing up time to focus on strategic activities, thus enhancing your value as a consultant or business owner and potentially increasing your income through efficiency gains.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "GetTimesheetRecords" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
