# Manual Thehive Create Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, theHive.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: TheHive (theHive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: TheHive1 (theHive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: TheHive2 (theHive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating, updating, and retrieving cases in TheHive, a security incident response platform. It begins with a manual trigger to start the workflow, creates a new case, updates its severity, and finally retrieves the case details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner in cybersecurity might use this workflow to streamline incident management. When a new security threat arises, they can quickly create a case in TheHive, update its severity based on ongoing assessments, and retrieve details to keep their team informed, all without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node as the starting point.
3. Add a **TheHive** node to create a case, filling in parameters like title and severity.
4. Add another **TheHive** node to update the case severity.
5. Finally, add a third **TheHive** node to retrieve the case details.
6. Connect the nodes in sequence and execute the workflow.

### Practice
Try running the workflow by clicking "execute." Modify the case details (title, severity) in the TheHive node and observe how it affects the case retrieval in the last node. Experiment with different severity levels to see how the data changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate incident management processes, saving time and reducing errors. As a consultant, you can offer this as a service to organizations needing efficient incident response systems, potentially increasing your revenue and client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "TheHive2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
