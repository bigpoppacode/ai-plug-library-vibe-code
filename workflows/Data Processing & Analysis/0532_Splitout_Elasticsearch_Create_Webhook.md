# Splitout Elasticsearch Create Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, splitOut.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Fetch Source Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Split Out Results Only (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Filter Score >= 0.9 (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Crop Object From Image (editImage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set Variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Use Detr-Resnet-50 Object Classification (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Upload to Cloudinary (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Create Docs In Elasticsearch (elasticsearch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Fetch Source Image Again (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates image processing by fetching a source image, identifying objects using AI, cropping those objects, uploading them, and indexing the results in Elasticsearch. It's designed to create a searchable database of images based on object recognition.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate product image management for an e-commerce site. By processing images to identify and crop products, they can streamline their inventory system, improve product listings, and enhance customer search functionality.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the workflow.
3. Use the HTTP Request node to fetch an image from a URL.
4. Implement the Detr-Resnet-50 AI model in another HTTP Request node to classify objects.
5. Apply the Filter node to process only high-confidence results (score >= 0.9).
6. Implement the Edit Image node to crop identified objects.
7. Upload cropped images to a cloud storage service using another HTTP Request node.
8. Index the images in Elasticsearch for future searches.
9. Test the workflow with a sample image URL.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the source image URL to one of your own. Observe how the workflow processes the new image, identifies objects, and crops them accordingly. Experiment with different images to see how accuracy varies.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate image processing tasks for businesses, enhancing operational efficiency and creating valuable searchable databases. This skill can help you attract clients in e-commerce, media, or any sector relying on visual content, increasing your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
