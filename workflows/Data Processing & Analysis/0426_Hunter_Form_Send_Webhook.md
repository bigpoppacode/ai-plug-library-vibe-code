## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of lead qualification. It collects an email from a form, checks if it's valid, scores the lead using MadKudu, verifies the email with Hunter, and sends an outreach email if the lead fits the criteria.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically evaluate leads collected from a website form. Instead of manually checking each lead's email and qualifications, the workflow streamlines outreach to only those who meet the desired criteria, saving time and increasing efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Set up a form to collect leads (like Typeform).
2. Add a **Webhook Trigger** in n8n to capture submissions.
3. Use an **If Node** to validate emails.
4. Integrate MadKudu for scoring.
5. Use Hunter to verify emails.
6. Send an email via Gmail if the score meets your threshold.
7. Test and activate the workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow: collect a single email address from a form, validate it, and send a confirmation email if it's valid. Experiment with different email addresses to see how the workflow responds.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate lead qualification, saving time and reducing manual errors. It can help you attract more customers by providing faster follow-ups, ultimately increasing revenue and enhancing client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "HubSpot" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
