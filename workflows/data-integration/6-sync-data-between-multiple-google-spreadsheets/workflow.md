# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving googleSheets, cron.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Read Sheet** node.
2. **Step 1: Read Sheet (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Write Sheet 2 (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Write Sheet 1 (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading data from a Google Sheet every two hours and updating two separate sheets with the same data. It streamlines data management, ensuring that information is consistently reflected across multiple locations.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to regularly update sales data across different teams. For example, if a sales team logs daily sales in one Google Sheet, this workflow can automatically push that data to another sheet for management review every two hours, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron node** to schedule the workflow every two hours.
3. Add a **Read Sheet (Google Sheets)** node to read data from your source sheet.
4. Add two **Write Sheet (Google Sheets)** nodes to update two target sheets with the data from the first step.
5. Connect the nodes in the correct order and save your workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to read data from one Google Sheet and update it in a different format to a new sheet. Experiment with changing the range of data read or how it's written to the sheets to reinforce your understanding of data manipulation in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you time and reduce errors in data management, making your operations more efficient. As you learn to automate processes like this, you can offer these services to clients, helping them streamline their operations and potentially generating a new revenue stream for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Read Sheet" and "Write Sheet 1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
