## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data handling by downloading a CSV file, filtering it for specific regions in 2023, and uploading the cleaned data to Google Sheets. It starts with a manual trigger and processes the data step by step.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to track COVID-19 testing data for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, ensuring they have up-to-date statistics for reporting or decision-making without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new n8n workflow and add a Manual Trigger node.
2. Add an HTTP Request node to download your desired CSV data.
3. Use a Spreadsheet File node to import the CSV.
4. Add a Set node to create unique identifiers.
5. Filter the data using a Filter node.
6. Upload the processed data to Google Sheets with the Google Sheets node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to filter data for a different region or year. Change the parameters in the Filter node and observe how it affects the data uploaded to Google Sheets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate tedious data processes, saving time and reducing errors. As a consultant or business owner, you can offer similar automation services, enhancing your value and creating a scalable business model.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
