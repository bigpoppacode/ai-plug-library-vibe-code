# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving scheduleTrigger, todoist, notion.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: On schedule (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get all tasks with specific label (todoist)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Add to Notion database (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Replace label on task (todoist)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching tasks labeled "send-to-notion" from Todoist on a schedule, adding them to a Notion database, and then updating the original tasks' labels to "sent" in Todoist.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline task management by automatically transferring completed tasks from Todoist to Notion for record-keeping, ensuring no tasks are overlooked and improving organization.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Schedule Trigger node to define when the workflow runs.
3. Add a Todoist node to fetch tasks with the "send-to-notion" label.
4. Add a Notion node to create a new entry in your Notion database for each task.
5. Add another Todoist node to update the original tasks' labels to "sent".
6. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that fetches a different label from Todoist (like "urgent") and adds those tasks to a separate Notion database. Experiment with changing the label after transferring the tasks.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate task management, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract clients by offering tailored automation solutions, increasing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On schedule" and "Replace label on task" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
