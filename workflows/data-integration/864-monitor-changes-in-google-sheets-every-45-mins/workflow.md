# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving mattermost, function, googleSheets.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Send message** node.
2. **Step 1: Send message (mattermost)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Check if new data (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Read data (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Execute every 45 mins (interval)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks a Google Sheet for new data every 45 minutes. If new entries are found, it sends a message via Mattermost with the details (ID, Name, Email) of the new data to keep the team updated.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically notify their team about new customer sign-ups recorded in a Google Sheet every 45 minutes, ensuring timely follow-ups without manual checks.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Google Sheet with relevant data.
3. Modify the Mattermost node with your message format.
4. Adjust the trigger to check your Google Sheet every 45 minutes.
5. Test the workflow to ensure notifications are sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet, add a few entries, and run the workflow. Verify if the Mattermost messages reflect the new entries. Try adding more data to see if notifications trigger as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you time and enhance client communication. By automating updates, you can offer valuable services to businesses, helping them streamline operations and improve responsiveness, leading to potential income growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Send message" and "Execute every 45 mins" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
