# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, googleSheets, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Google Sheets2 (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set1 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Google Sheets1 (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Google Sheets (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data handling with Google Sheets. It triggers manually, fetches data from a sheet, processes it (like adjusting rent), updates another sheet, and appends new data, streamlining data management.

### Demonstrate
A real-world example: A property management company could use this workflow to update tenant rent in a Google Sheet. When rent changes, the workflow fetches current data, modifies it, and logs the updated rent automatically, saving time on manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google Sheets credentials.
3. Modify the sheet ID and range to match your data.
4. Adjust the rent calculation in the "Set1" node.
5. Execute the workflow to see data updates in action.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow to log new customer sign-ups in Google Sheets. Use a manual trigger to input customer data, then append it to a designated sheet, practicing data management automation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive data tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients who need efficient data management solutions, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
