## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow manages a waitlist by collecting user information through a form, sending a verification email with a unique code, and validating the code entered by the user. Upon successful verification, it saves the user's details in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate the sign-up process for a new product launch. It ensures only verified users are added to the waitlist, improving data quality and user trust.

### Imitate
1. Create a Google Sheet for user data.
2. Set up a form to collect first name, last name, email, and company website.
3. Add nodes for email verification and Google Sheets integration.
4. Test the workflow by submitting the form and verifying email codes.

### Practice
Try modifying the email template in the workflow to better align with your brand voice, then test the workflow again to see how it changes the user experience.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated sign-up solutions, enhancing customer engagement and data management, which can lead to increased sales and client satisfaction in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Add  to Waitlist Sheet" and "Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
