## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving googleSheets, set, emailSend.

## 💼 Business Use Case
This is a valuable tool for automating data transfer, lead management, or internal processes, saving significant manual effort.

1. **Waitlist Form (formTrigger)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
2. **Clean and Standardize (set)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
3. **Generate Random Verification Code (crypto)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
4. **Add  to Waitlist Sheet (googleSheets)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.
5. **Merge (merge)**: The workflow starts or proceeds with this step.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Add Trigger (If Needed):** If this workflow doesn't start with a trigger (like Schedule or Webhook), add one to automate it.
2. **Connect Credentials:** Go through each node and connect your accounts (e.g., Google, Airtable, OpenAI).
3. **Customize Parameters:** Review key nodes like "Add  to Waitlist Sheet" and "Note3" and update any placeholder IDs, table names, or URLs to match your specific needs.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
