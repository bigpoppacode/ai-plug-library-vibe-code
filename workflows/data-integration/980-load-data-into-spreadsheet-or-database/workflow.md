# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Mock data (CRM Contacts) (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Replace me (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain:
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting CRM contact data, transforming it, and preparing it for storage in a database or spreadsheet. It starts with a manual trigger, processes mock CRM data, and sets values like name and email, readying the info for the next step.

### Demonstrate:
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline data entry. For example, after a marketing campaign, they can quickly gather leads from a mock CRM, set their details, and add them to a Google Sheet or Airtable, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate:
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the manual trigger to run the workflow.
3. In the "Mock data (CRM Contacts)" node, customize the mock data to reflect your actual CRM data structure.
4. In the "Set" node, ensure the fields (Name, Email) match your data.
5. Replace the "Replace me" node with an action to save data in your desired database (e.g., Google Sheets).

### Practice:
Try modifying the mock data to include additional fields like phone number or company name. Test the workflow to see how it handles this new data and ensure it maps correctly in your chosen database.

### WIIFM:
Mastering this workflow helps you automate data collection and processing, which is essential for running efficient operations. This skill can attract clients who need streamlined data management systems, ultimately generating income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Replace me" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
