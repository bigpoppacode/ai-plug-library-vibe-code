# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving readPDF, stickyNote, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On email received** node.
2. **Step 1: Read PDF (readPDF)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Configure (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Is PDF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Not a PDF (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Is matched (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: This is a matched PDF (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: This is not a matched PDF (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Iterate over email attachments (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: OpenAI matches PDF textual content (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Upload file to folder (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: On email received (gmailTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Ignore large PDFs (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Is text within token limit? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Has attachments? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: There are no attachments (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading PDF attachments from emails, filtering them based on specific criteria using OpenAI, and then uploading matched PDFs to a designated Google Drive folder. It streamlines document management by reducing manual sorting.

### Demonstrate
A business owner receives invoices as PDF attachments in emails. Using this workflow, they can automatically filter and save only relevant invoices to Google Drive, ensuring organized record-keeping without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Gmail Trigger node to capture incoming emails.
3. Use a code node to iterate through email attachments.
4. Implement an OpenAI node to check if the PDF matches your criteria.
5. Connect a Google Drive node to upload matched PDFs to a specified folder.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the "Match on" parameter in the Configure node to filter different types of PDFs (e.g., receipts instead of invoices) and observe how it affects the workflow's output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you save time and improve organization, making it a valuable service for businesses. By offering automated document management, you can attract clients, streamline their processes, and generate income as part of your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Read PDF" and "There are no attachments" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
