# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, zoom, dateTime.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Zoom (zoom)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Date & Time (dateTime)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Google Calendar (googleCalendar)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: IF Zoom meeting (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Cron Once a Day (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scheduling Zoom meetings based on existing Google Calendar events. It filters out certain meetings, calculates durations, and sets up new Zoom meetings efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically schedule Zoom meetings based on client appointments in Google Calendar, ensuring they never double-book and saving time on manual entries.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Zoom and Google Calendar accounts.
3. Customize the calendar ID and meeting topics.
4. Set the cron trigger to your preferred schedule.
5. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Create a small exercise by adding a new condition in the IF node to filter out meetings with a specific keyword (e.g., "internal"). Run the workflow to see if it successfully excludes those meetings.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline scheduling, reduce manual errors, and enhance client interactions, making your services more attractive to potential customers and increasing your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Cron Once a Day" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
