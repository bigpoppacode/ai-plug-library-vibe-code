# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, if, noOp.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Is new? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Do something here (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Mark Row as processed (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Read sheet (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set processed value (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Run every 5 minutes (interval)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where, upon execution, it checks a Google Sheet for new entries, processes them, marks them as handled, and repeats every 5 minutes. This helps streamline data management tasks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically track customer inquiries in a Google Sheet. When a new inquiry is added, the workflow processes it, updates its status, and ensures no inquiries are missed, saving time and improving response rates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets account.
3. Adjust the Google Sheet ID in the workflow to your own.
4. Customize the "Do something here" step to add your specific processing logic.
5. Execute the workflow manually and then set the interval to run every 5 minutes.

### Practice
Try creating a new Google Sheet with sample data. Modify the workflow to process and categorize the data differently, then execute it to see how it updates the sheet. Experiment with adding new rows and observe the automated responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate routine tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients needing efficiency in their operations, enabling you to generate income by offering automation solutions tailored to their needs.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Run every 5 minutes" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
