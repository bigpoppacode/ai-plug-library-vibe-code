# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, awsRekognition, googleSheets.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **HTTP Request1** node.
2. **Step 1: HTTP Request1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: AWS Rekognition1 (awsRekognition)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Google Sheets2 (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set3 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of searching for street images online, analyzing them using AWS Rekognition for labels, and then storing the results in Google Sheets. It helps streamline data collection and organization without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A real-world example is a marketing agency wanting to create a visual inventory for a city guide. This workflow collects street images, identifies key features (like landmarks), and logs them in a spreadsheet for easy access and planning.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the **HTTP Request** node with your search criteria.
3. Set up AWS Rekognition with your credentials to analyze images.
4. Connect Google Sheets and create a new sheet or use an existing one to append data.
5. Adjust the **Set** node to format the data you want saved.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with a different search term, such as "nature" or "buildings." Observe how the results change and ensure the labels in Google Sheets reflect the new data. Experiment with modifying the output format in the Set node.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently gather and organize visual data, which can be invaluable for businesses needing image analytics. This skill positions you to offer automation services, enhancing your value as a consultant and potentially increasing your income through streamlined processes.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTTP Request1" and "Set3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
