# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving scheduleTrigger, graphql, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Every day at 06:00 (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get all your team's tickets (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: if has next page (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get end cursor (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get next page (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Split out the tickets (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Set custom fields (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Write tickets to Sheets (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Flatten object to have simple fields to filter by (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates daily ticket management for a team by fetching all tickets from a project management tool (like Linear), processing them, and writing the data to Google Sheets. It runs every day at 6:00 AM, ensuring the team stays updated.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline their team's task management. For instance, if they manage a software development team, this workflow helps track project tickets, ensuring everyone knows the status of tasks and deadlines without manual updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the schedule trigger to your desired time.
3. Update the GraphQL query with your team's name.
4. Connect your Google Sheets account.
5. Adjust custom fields as needed.
6. Activate the workflow to run automatically.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to add a condition that only fetches tickets based on priority (e.g., high priority). This helps you understand conditional logic and how to filter data in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate routine tasks, saving time and reducing errors. It positions you to offer valuable automation services to clients, helping them scale operations efficiently and potentially generating a new income stream for you.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Every day at 06:00" and "Flatten object to have simple fields to filter by" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
