# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, scheduleTrigger, googleCalendar.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: List scheduled events from Discord (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: On schedule (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Update event details (googleCalendar)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Create event (googleCalendar)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get events (googleCalendar)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Create or update? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Configure (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow syncs scheduled events from a Discord server to Google Calendar. It checks for new or updated events and either creates or updates corresponding calendar events based on the information retrieved from Discord.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline event management. For instance, if they run a community on Discord and host regular events, this automation ensures all events are automatically reflected in their Google Calendar, minimizing manual updates.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to define when the workflow runs.
3. Use an **HTTP Request Node** to list scheduled events from Discord.
4. Add **Google Calendar Nodes** to create or update events based on the data.
5. Connect nodes logically to ensure data flows correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a notification step that sends an alert to your email whenever a new event is created in Google Calendar from Discord. This will reinforce your understanding of node connections and data flow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract clients looking for automation solutions, enabling you to build a profitable AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "List scheduled events from Discord" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
