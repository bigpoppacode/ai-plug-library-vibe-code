# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving if, notion, asana.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On update** node.
2. **Step 1: Determine create/update (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Update task (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Create task (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Get tasks (asana)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Find tasks (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get unique tasks (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Determine (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Check required fields exist (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Update deadline (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: On update (asanaTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management between Asana and Notion. It checks if tasks in Asana need to be created or updated in Notion based on their status, ensuring tasks are consistently tracked across both platforms.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline project management. For instance, if they manage tasks in Asana and want to keep a Notion database updated automatically, this workflow ensures that every task change reflects in Notion, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add an "Asana Trigger" node to capture task updates.
3. Use a "Function" node to determine if the task is new or existing.
4. Add "Notion" nodes to create or update tasks based on the previous step's output.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it functions as expected.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only updates Notion with new tasks from Asana. Trigger it manually to see how task information flows from Asana to Notion, allowing you to grasp the mechanics before adding complexity.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation solutions to clients, saving them time and improving their project management efficiency. This expertise can attract new customers, leading to increased revenue for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Determine create/update" and "On update" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
