## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates daily meeting reminders by fetching events from Google Calendar, checking if they match today's date, and sending a summary message to a Slack channel. It runs every day at 6 AM.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to ensure their team receives daily reminders about meetings, helping them stay organized and prepared. For example, a project manager can automate reminders for daily stand-up meetings.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Calendar node to fetch events.
2. Use a function node to get today’s date.
3. Add an IF node to check if event dates match today.
4. Use a Set node to format event details.
5. Merge event details and send a Slack message.
6. Schedule the workflow with a Cron node.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that fetches tasks from a project management tool like Trello or Asana and sends reminders to Slack about upcoming deadlines.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable automation services to clients, enhancing their productivity. It allows you to differentiate your offerings, leading to potential new income streams and satisfied customers.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
