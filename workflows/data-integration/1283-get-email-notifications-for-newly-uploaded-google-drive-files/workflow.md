### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring a specific Google Drive folder. When a new file is created in that folder, it sends an email notification to a designated recipient with the file's name.

2. Add an Email Node to send notifications.
3. Customize the email subject and body to include information about the new file.
4. Test the workflow by adding a file to the monitored folder.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
