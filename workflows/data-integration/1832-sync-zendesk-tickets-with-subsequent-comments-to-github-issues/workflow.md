# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving zendesk, if, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get ticket** node.
2. **Step 1: Get ticket (zendesk)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Update ticket (zendesk)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Determine (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Create issue (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates customer support by integrating Zendesk and GitHub. When a new ticket is created in Zendesk, it checks if a related GitHub issue exists. If not, it creates a new issue; if it does, it adds a comment to the existing issue and updates the Zendesk ticket with the GitHub issue number.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline tech support. When customers submit tickets about software bugs, the workflow creates or updates GitHub issues for developers, ensuring issues are tracked and resolved efficiently, improving response times and customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Webhook Trigger** for new Zendesk tickets.
3. Use a **Get Ticket** node to fetch ticket details.
4. Add a **Function Node** to determine if a GitHub issue exists.
5. Use an **IF Node** to either create a new GitHub issue or comment on an existing one.
6. Finally, use an **Update Ticket** node for Zendesk to log the GitHub issue number.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log ticket details into a Google Sheet. Create a new node after the **Get Ticket** step to append ticket details into a Google Sheets document. This will reinforce how to handle data flow and integration with external services.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can significantly enhance your service offerings as an automation consultant. By automating support ticket management, you can save clients time, reduce errors, and improve customer satisfaction—leading to higher retention and potential referrals, boosting your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get ticket" and "On new Zendesk ticket" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
