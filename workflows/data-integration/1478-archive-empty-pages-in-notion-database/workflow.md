# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving notion, function, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get All Databases** node.
2. **Step 1: Get All Databases (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get All Database Pages (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get Page Blocks (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Process Blocks (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Check for empty properties (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Archive Page (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: If toDelete (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of archiving Notion database pages that have empty properties. It runs daily, retrieves all databases and their pages, checks for empty fields, and archives pages accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with a Notion workspace can use this workflow to keep their database clean by automatically archiving pages that lack essential information, saving time and ensuring data integrity.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron Trigger** to run daily.
3. Use **Get All Databases** and **Get All Database Pages** nodes to fetch your Notion data.
4. Implement **Check for Empty Properties** and **If Empty Properties** nodes to identify pages to archive.
5. Add **Archive Page** node to archive identified pages.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to only archive pages that have a specific property (e.g., "Status" set to "Inactive"). Run the workflow and check if only the targeted pages are archived.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline Notion management for clients, enhancing their productivity and data organization. This can lead to new service offerings and increased revenue as businesses seek efficient automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get All Databases" and "Every day @ 2am" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
