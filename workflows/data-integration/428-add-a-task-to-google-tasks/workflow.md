# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, googleTasks.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Google Tasks (googleTasks)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process where a user manually triggers an action that interacts with Google Tasks. It allows users to create or manage tasks without manual input each time, streamlining task management.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner can use this workflow to quickly add tasks to their Google Tasks list based on recurring events, such as weekly meetings or project deadlines, saving time and ensuring nothing is forgotten.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n and add a **Manual Trigger** node.
2. Add a **Google Tasks** node to create or manage tasks.
3. Configure the Google Tasks node with your credentials and set the task details.
4. Connect the Manual Trigger to the Google Tasks node.
5. Execute the workflow to test the task creation.

### Practice
Try modifying the Google Tasks node to add different types of tasks or set specific due dates. Experiment with triggering the workflow multiple times to see how tasks are created in Google Tasks.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate task management, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients needing efficient task organization, helping you grow your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Google Tasks" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
