  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When Executed by Another Workflow**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **Send Email** `gmailTool` — sendTo: "={{ $fromAI("emailAddress") }}", subject: "={{ $fromAI("subject") }}", message: "={{ $fromAI("emailBody") }}"
4. **Get Emails** `gmailTool` — operation: **getAll**
5. **Create Draft** `gmailTool` — resource: **draft**
6. **Email Reply** `gmailTool` — operation: **reply**
7. **Get Labels** `gmailTool` — resource: **label**
8. **Label Emails** `gmailTool` — operation: **addLabels**
9. **Mark Unread** `gmailTool` — operation: **markAsUnread**
10. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
11. **Email Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json.query }}", options: "[object Object]"
12. **Success** `set` — assignments: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
13. **Try Again** `set` — assignments: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates email management using AI. It retrieves emails, drafts or sends emails, labels them, and marks them as unread. It uses an AI model to determine the action to take for each email, such as sending a reply or creating a draft, ensuring efficient email handling.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to manage customer inquiries efficiently, ensuring timely responses and organized email handling, which improves customer satisfaction and reduces manual workload.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Gmail and OpenAI accounts.  
3. Set up triggers for email retrieval.  
4. Customize email actions based on your needs.  
5. Test the workflow with sample emails to ensure it behaves as expected.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Gmail account, send various emails to it, and run the workflow. Observe how it processes different emails, drafts replies, and organizes them with labels. Modify the AI model's parameters to see different outcomes.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer email automation services, enhancing business efficiency and customer service. This skill can attract clients seeking to streamline their communication processes, opening opportunities for recurring income in automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
