  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow starts by capturing form submissions through an n8n form trigger. It then uses Hunter to verify the email address provided in the form. If the email is valid, the workflow sends a notification email via Gmail, updates a Google Sheet with the lead's details, and optionally sends a notification to a Discord channel. If the email is invalid, the workflow stops without further actions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically verify and manage new leads from their website. By ensuring emails are valid, they maintain a clean contact list, improving the efficiency of their marketing campaigns.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Gmail, Google Sheets, and Discord accounts.
3. Set up your form fields for lead capture.
4. Map the form data to the respective nodes.
5. Test with sample data to ensure the workflow functions as expected.

### Practice
Create a simple form with fields for Name, Email, and Queries. Use the workflow to test the email verification and check if the Google Sheet updates correctly. Adjust the Discord notification settings to receive alerts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate lead management efficiently, ensuring only valid emails enter your database. This can improve your marketing ROI and offer a valuable service to clients seeking automation, potentially increasing your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2, discordWebhookApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
