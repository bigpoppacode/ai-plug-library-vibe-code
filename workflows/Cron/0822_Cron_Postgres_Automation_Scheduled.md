# Cron Postgres Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Postgres**.
  2. **Postgres** `postgres` — table: `n8n`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating and storing random humidity data in a Postgres database. Every minute, it creates a timestamped entry with a random humidity value, simulating a sensor's data feed. This allows for continuous data ingestion into the database, which can be useful for monitoring and analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to simulate sensor data for testing an IoT application, ensuring the database can handle continuous data input before deploying real sensors.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Postgres database credentials.
3. Ensure the Postgres table “n8n” is set up with the correct columns.
4. Activate the workflow to start data ingestion.
5. Monitor the database to see the data entries being added every minute.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that logs random temperature data. Adjust the function code to generate random temperature values and store them in a different Postgres table. Monitor the entries to ensure correct functionality.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer data simulation services to clients, helping them test and optimize their applications. This can expand your service offerings and increase your value in the automation business, potentially leading to more projects and income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
