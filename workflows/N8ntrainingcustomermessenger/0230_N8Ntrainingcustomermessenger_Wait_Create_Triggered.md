# N8ntrainingcustomermessenger Wait Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, wait×2, n8nTrainingCustomerMessenger×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Customer Messenger - Send message to client**.
  2. **Customer Messenger - Send message to client** `n8nTrainingCustomerMessenger` — message: "=
Hi {{$node["Customer Datastore"].json["name"]}}
This message was sent at {{$now.toLocaleString(DateTime.TIME_WITH_SECONDS)}}", customerId: "={{$node["Customer Datastore"].json["id"]}}"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending personalized messages to customers from a datastore. It retrieves customer data, sends messages in batches with a delay to avoid overwhelming systems, and waits for external approval before continuing. The process ensures that customer communication is efficient and timely.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to send personalized updates to their customers, such as order confirmations or promotional messages, ensuring each customer receives attention without manual effort. This automation helps maintain customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your customer datastore and messaging service.
3. Set a trigger to start the workflow.
4. Adjust the message content and delay settings as needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure messages are sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a test customer datastore with sample data and run the workflow. Observe how messages are sent with delays and how the workflow waits for external approval before proceeding. Adjust parameters and test different scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage customer communications, enhancing customer relationships while saving time. This skill can attract clients looking for automated solutions, providing a revenue stream through offering automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
