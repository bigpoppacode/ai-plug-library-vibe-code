# Telegram Gumroad Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Gumroad Sale Trigger**.
2. **Gumroad Sale Trigger** `gumroadTrigger` — resource: **sale**
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "320", height: "460", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "400", height: "380"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "320", height: "420"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "320", content: "## Notify team in Telegram
Set up your Telegram bot and add to a channel as admin to notify everyone about the updates."
7. **List publications** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.beehiiv.com/v2/publications`
8. **Post subscription** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.beehiiv.com/v2/publications/{{ $json.data[0].id }}/subscriptions`
9. **append row in CRM** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
10. **Set ChatID** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Notify in channel** `telegram` — text: "=🔔 New Gumroad sale!
Product: {{ $('Gumroad Sale Trigger').item.json.product_name }} 
Email: {{ $('Gumroad Sale Trigger').item.json.email }} 
Country: {{ $('Gumroad Sale Trigger')…[truncated]", chatId: "={{ $json.telegramChatId }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of adding new Gumroad customers to a Beehiiv newsletter and notifying your team in Telegram. When a sale occurs on Gumroad, the workflow triggers, retrieves the customer's email, and subscribes them to your Beehiiv publication. It then logs the sale information into a Google Sheet and sends a notification to a specified Telegram channel.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner selling digital products on Gumroad could use this workflow to automatically grow their newsletter audience and keep their team informed about sales in real-time, enhancing customer engagement and team coordination.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gumroad, Beehiiv, Google Sheets, and Telegram accounts.
3. Configure the Gumroad trigger and Beehiiv API settings.
4. Set up the Google Sheet for logging sales and Telegram for notifications.
5. Test the workflow with a sample sale.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Gumroad product and simulate a sale to see how the workflow adds the subscriber to Beehiiv, logs the sale in Google Sheets, and sends a Telegram notification. Adjust settings and test different scenarios.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer seamless integration services to clients, enhancing their marketing efforts and internal communications. This could lead to new business opportunities and recurring income by providing automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gumroadApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, httpBearerAuth, httpHeaderAuth, telegramApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
