# Telegram Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
2. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "2260.4312974923314", height: "1739.059401992624", content: ""
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "644.910132006371", height: "655.8676264589326"
4. **OpenAI Chat Model3** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
5. **Gmail trigger** `gmailTrigger` — simple: "false", filters: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "478.42665735513924", height: "651.7534899914576"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "821.8034694793512", height: "987.2767141363915"
8. **Get message content1** `gmail` — operation: **get**
9. **Delete the unnecessary items** `code` — jsCode: "// Loop over input items and add a new field called 'myNewField' to the JSON of each one
for (const item of $input.all()) {
 delete item.json.threadId;
 delete item.json.labelIds;
…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting promotional emails from Gmail into audio podcasts. It triggers every minute to check for new emails with the label "CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS". The email content is fetched, unnecessary details are removed, and the content is summarized using OpenAI. The summary is then converted into speech using a text-to-speech service. Finally, the audio file is sent to a specified Telegram chat, allowing users to listen to the promotional content easily.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to convert promotional emails into audio format, making it easier for customers to consume content on-the-go, enhancing engagement and accessibility.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Gmail and Telegram accounts.  
3. Set the Gmail trigger to filter for "CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS".  
4. Customize the summarization and TTS settings.  
5. Test by sending a promotional email to your Gmail and checking Telegram for the audio message.

**Practice**  
Create a test Gmail account and label some emails as "CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS". Run the workflow and verify that the emails are summarized and sent as audio messages to your Telegram. Adjust the summarization to improve clarity and conciseness.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer unique services like converting emails to audio content, appealing to clients looking to engage audiences through innovative methods. This skill can differentiate your automation business, attract new customers, and increase revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, openAiApi, telegramApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
