# Telegram Hunter Send Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, if×2, noOp×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **n8n Form Trigger**.
2. **n8n Form Trigger** `formTrigger` — path: `/0bf8840f-1cc4-46a9-86af-a3fa8da80608`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "545.9804141018467", height: "183.48964745383324"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "139"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "84"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "84"
7. **Verify email with Hunter** `hunter` — operation: **emailVerifier**
8. **Check if the email is valid** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
9. **Score lead with MadKudu** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.madkudu.com/v1/persons?email={{ $json.email }}`
10. **Email is not valid, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
11. **if customer fit score > 60** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **Telegram** `telegram` — text: "=⭐ New hot lead: {{ $json.email }}... 

{{ $json.properties.customer_fit.top_signals_formatted }}", chatId: "1688282582", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
13. **Not interesting enough** `noOp` — configured for its default action.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow is designed to streamline lead management by verifying email validity and assessing lead quality. It begins with a form submission via n8n's Form Trigger, where a business email is collected. The email is then verified using Hunter's email verification service. If the email is valid, the workflow checks the lead's quality using MadKudu. If the lead's score exceeds 60, indicating a high-quality lead, a notification is sent via Telegram. If the email is invalid or the lead score is insufficient, the workflow takes no further action.

### Demonstrate
A sales team at a SaaS company could use this workflow to efficiently manage incoming leads. By automating email verification and lead scoring, they ensure that only high-quality leads are pursued, optimizing sales efforts and improving conversion rates.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and import the workflow.
2. Connect Hunter, MadKudu, and Telegram accounts in n8n.
3. Customize the form path and Telegram chat ID.
4. Test the workflow with sample emails to ensure it functions correctly.
5. Activate the workflow for live lead management.

### Practice
Create a test form and input various emails, some valid and some invalid. Observe how the workflow processes each entry, verifying emails and scoring leads, and note how it handles different scenarios, such as invalid emails or low lead scores.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated lead management services to businesses, enhancing their sales processes. By providing efficient lead qualification, you can improve client retention and open opportunities for upselling automation services, ultimately generating more income for your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
