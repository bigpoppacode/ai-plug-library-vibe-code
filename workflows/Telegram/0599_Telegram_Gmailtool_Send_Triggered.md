# Telegram Gmailtool Send Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Listen for incoming events**.
2. **Google Calendar** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **getAll**
3. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $('Listen for incoming events').first().json.message.from.id }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
4. **Get Email** `gmailTool` — operation: **getAll**
5. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o-mini`
6. **Listen for incoming events** `telegramTrigger` — updates: "message", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "496.25", height: "278.75"
8. **Tasks** `baserowTool` — table: `372174`
9. **Contacts** `baserowTool` — table: `372177`
10. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "386.9292441979969", height: "389.78268107403096"
11. **Voice or Text** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
12. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **Get Voice File** `telegram` — resource: **file**
14. **Speech to Text** `openAi` — resource: **audio**, operation: **transcribe**
15. **Angie, AI Assistant 👩🏻‍🏫** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.text }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
16. **Telegram** `telegram` — text: "={{ $json.output }}", chatId: "={{ $('Listen for incoming events').first().json.message.from.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow listens for incoming messages or voice notes on Telegram, processes them to extract text, and responds using an AI assistant. It checks Google Calendar and Gmail for relevant updates and uses OpenAI to generate intelligent responses. The workflow can handle both text and voice inputs, transcribing voice messages into text before processing.

**Demonstrate:**  
A consultant could use this workflow to automate client communication, allowing clients to send inquiries via Telegram and receive immediate, AI-generated responses based on their calendar or email data.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Telegram, Google Calendar, Gmail, and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set up the Telegram trigger to listen for messages.
4. Customize the AI assistant's prompt to fit your needs.
5. Test the workflow by sending a message or voice note via Telegram.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Telegram bot and send a message or voice note. Observe how the workflow processes the input and generates a response. Modify the AI prompt to change the response style and test again.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated communication solutions to businesses, enhancing customer engagement and saving time. This can increase your service offerings and revenue in the AI automation sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2, openAiApi, telegramApi, baserowApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
