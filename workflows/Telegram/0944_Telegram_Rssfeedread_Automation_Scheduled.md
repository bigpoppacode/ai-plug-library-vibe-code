### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring RSS feeds from Instagram and Weibo. It checks for new posts and sends notifications to a Telegram chat. It filters out duplicate posts by comparing links, extracts images from the content, and decides whether to send a photo or a text message based on the number of images.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Instagram and Weibo RSS feeds and Telegram account.
3. Customize the Telegram chat IDs and credentials.
4. Test the workflow by manually triggering it or setting a schedule.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
