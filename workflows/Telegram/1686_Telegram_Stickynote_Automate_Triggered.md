# Telegram Stickynote Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using telegram×5, stickyNote×3, lmChatOpenAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Listen for incoming events**.
2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "=chat_with_{{ $('Listen for incoming events').first().json.message.chat.id }}", contextWindowLength: "10"
4. **Listen for incoming events** `telegramTrigger` — updates: "*", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1035.4478381373049", height: "547.5630890194532", content: "## Receive and pre-process messages 
"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "861.262180151035", height: "550.5748478134515"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "367.73614918993235", height: "194.83713159725437"
8. **Determine content type** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Send Typing action** `telegram` — operation: **sendChatAction**
10. **Download voice file** `telegram` — resource: **file**
11. **Send error message** `telegram` — text: "=Sorry, {{ $('Listen for incoming events').first().json.message.from.first_name }}! This command is not supported yet. Please send text or voice messages.", chatId: "={{ $('Listen for incoming events').first().json.message.from.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
12. **Convert audio to text** `openAi` — resource: **audio**, operation: **transcribe**
13. **Combine content and set properties** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.CombinedMessage }}", options: "[object Object]"
15. **Send final reply** `telegram` — text: "={{ $json.output }} 

Thank you for your{{ $('Combine content and set properties').item.json['Source Type'] }} {{ $('Combine content and set properties').item.json['Message Type ']…[truncated]", chatId: "={{ $('Listen for incoming events').first().json.message.from.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
16. **Correct errors** `telegram` — text: "={{ $('AI Agent').item.json.output.replace(/&/g, "&amp;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;").replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/"/g, "&quot;") }}", chatId: "={{ $('Listen for incoming events').first().json.message.from.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow is a Telegram AI chatbot that can process both text and voice messages. It listens for incoming messages, determines if they are text or voice, and processes them accordingly. Text messages are sent directly to an AI agent, while voice messages are first converted to text using OpenAI's transcription service. The AI agent then generates a response, which is sent back to the user via Telegram. If the message type is unsupported, an error message is sent to the user.

**Demonstrate**  
A customer service team can use this workflow to provide instant support to customers via Telegram. It automates responses to common queries, saving time and ensuring customers receive quick and accurate information.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Telegram and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set the Telegram bot to listen for incoming messages.
4. Test the workflow with both text and voice messages.
5. Customize the AI responses to fit your business context.

**Practice**  
Create a simple Telegram bot using this workflow and test it by sending various text and voice messages. Observe how the workflow processes each type of message and generates responses. Adjust the AI settings to improve response quality.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer advanced AI-driven customer support solutions to businesses. It can help you attract clients looking for efficient ways to manage customer interactions, thereby increasing your service offerings and potential revenue in the AI automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, telegramApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
