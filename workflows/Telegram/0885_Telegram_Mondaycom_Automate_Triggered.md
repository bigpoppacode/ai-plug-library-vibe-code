# Telegram Mondaycom Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using mondayCom×2, telegram×2, freshdesk×2.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Telegram1**.
2. **Telegram1** `telegram` — text: "Hi, thanks for sending this. We will review your complaint as soon as possible 📬 ☀️ ✅", chatId: "={{$node["Telegram Trigger"].json["message"]["chat"]["id"]}}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the handling of Telegram messages related to refunds or complaints. When a message is received, it checks if it contains the word "refund." If it does, it creates a ticket in Freshdesk with the tag "refund" and sends a confirmation message back to the user. If not, it tags it as a "complaint" in Freshdesk and sends a different confirmation message. Both scenarios also log the message into Monday.com for tracking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline customer service processes by automatically categorizing refund requests and complaints, ensuring timely responses and efficient tracking.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Telegram, Freshdesk, and Monday.com accounts.
3. Set up the Telegram Trigger to listen for messages.
4. Customize Freshdesk and Monday.com nodes as needed.
5. Run and test the workflow with sample messages.

### Practice
Create a Telegram bot and send a message with the word "refund" to see how the workflow processes it. Then, send another message without "refund" and observe the different paths and responses in Freshdesk and Monday.com.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide automated customer support services, enhancing efficiency and response times. As a consultant, this can help you attract clients looking to optimize their customer service operations, leading to increased revenue opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, mondayComApi, freshdeskApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
