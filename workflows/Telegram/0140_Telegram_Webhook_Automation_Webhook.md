# Telegram Webhook Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **limpaPacoteCliente0**.
2. **limpaPacoteCliente0** `mySql` — operation: **executeQuery**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of cleaning up old records in a MySQL database. It identifies records older than a month with a specific status and updates their status to 'DELETE'. The workflow can be triggered manually, by a schedule, or via a webhook. Once the records are updated, it sends notifications via Telegram to inform about the cleanup actions performed.

### Demonstrate
A logistics company could use this workflow to manage their database of package records, ensuring outdated records are marked for deletion. This keeps the database clean and improves system performance, while notifications keep the team informed of the process.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your MySQL and Telegram accounts.
3. Set up a schedule or webhook trigger to run the workflow.
4. Ensure your MySQL queries match the structure and requirements of your database.
5. Test the workflow to confirm it updates records and sends notifications correctly.

### Practice
Create a test MySQL database with sample records. Run the workflow and observe how it updates records older than a month. Modify the criteria or notification settings to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer database maintenance services, helping businesses keep their data clean and organized. This can lead to additional service opportunities, improving client satisfaction and generating recurring revenue for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, mySql.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
