# Telegram Schedule Monitor Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "## Step 1
Create a new google sheet where A1 is a title, and then list in column A all the urls you want to check."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — content: "## Step 2
To use telegram, simply define chatid.

You can replace with any type of notification like slack, etc..."
5. **Fetch Urls** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
6. **Check URL** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.URLS }}`
7. **No Operation, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
8. **Telegram** `telegram` — text: "=Health Check :  {{ $json.URLS }}

{{ $json.error.code }}", chatId: "1548053076", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to periodically check the health of URLs listed in a Google Sheet. It fetches these URLs, checks their status using HTTP requests, and then sends notifications via Telegram if any URLs are down or return errors. This helps in maintaining website uptime and ensuring all links are functioning correctly.

### Demonstrate
A website owner could use this workflow to automatically monitor the availability of their site and related pages. If any page goes down, they receive an instant Telegram alert, allowing for quick response and minimizing downtime.

### Imitate
1. Create a Google Sheet and list URLs in column A.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Connect your Google Sheets and Telegram accounts.
4. Set up a schedule trigger to run the workflow at your desired frequency.
5. Test the setup to ensure Telegram notifications are received when URLs are down.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with a few URLs, some valid and some invalid. Run the workflow and observe how Telegram alerts you to the status of each URL. Try adding more URLs to test the scalability of the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated website monitoring services, ensuring clients' sites remain operational. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract more clients, and provide a recurring revenue stream as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
