# Telegram Rssfeedread Monitor Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using manualTrigger, rssFeedRead, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **AWS SES**.
2. **AWS SES** `awsSes` — body: "={{$node["Filter by current day"].json["data"]}}", subject: "New n8n version", fromEmail: "myemail@mydomain.com"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking for new releases of the n8n software on GitHub. It reads the RSS feed for n8n releases, filters for new versions published in the last four hours, and if found, sends notifications via Telegram and email using AWS SES. This ensures users are promptly informed about new n8n versions.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to stay updated on new software releases, ensuring they are always using the latest version of n8n. This is crucial for maintaining compatibility and accessing new features.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Telegram and AWS SES accounts.
3. Set up the Cron node to schedule the workflow at desired intervals.
4. Customize the email and Telegram details to suit your notification needs.
5. Test to ensure notifications are sent correctly when a new release is detected.

### Practice
Create a test RSS feed with mock release data and run the workflow to see how it processes updates. Adjust the filtering logic to test different scenarios, like detecting minor or major version updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer timely software update notifications as a service, ensuring clients always have the latest features and security patches. This can enhance your service offerings and lead to increased customer satisfaction and retention.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, aws.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
