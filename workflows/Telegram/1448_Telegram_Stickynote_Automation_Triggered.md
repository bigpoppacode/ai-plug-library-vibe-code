# Telegram Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using spotify×5, set×3, telegramTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Telegram Trigger**.
2. **Telegram Trigger** `telegramTrigger` — updates: "message", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "254.05813953488382", content: "## Telegram to Spotify 
Ask AI about a track with artist and song name or if you can't remember describe it and AI does it's thing.
"
4. **OpenAI - Ask about a track** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
5. **Search track** `spotify` — resource: **track**, operation: **search**
6. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Add song** `spotify` — id: "=spotify:track:{{ $json.id }}"
8. **Not found error message** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "{
  "error": "Song not found"
}
"
9. **Next Song** `spotify` — operation: **nextSong**
10. **Resume play** `spotify` — operation: **resume**
11. **Currently Playing** `spotify` — operation: **currentlyPlaying**
12. **Define Now Playing** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "={
  "error": "Now playing {{ $json.item.name }} - {{ $json.item.artists[0].name }} - {{ $json.item.album.name }}"
}
"
13. **Message parser** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combineBy: "combineAll"
15. **Return message to Telegram** `telegram` — text: "={{ $('Message parser').item.json.message }}", chatId: "={{ $json.message.chat.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of finding and playing music on Spotify using Telegram and OpenAI. When a user sends a message on Telegram describing a song or artist, OpenAI interprets the message to identify the track. The workflow then searches for the song on Spotify, adds it to the queue if found, and resumes playback. If the song is not found, a "Song not found" message is sent back to the user on Telegram.

### Demonstrate
A music enthusiast could use this workflow to easily find and play songs on Spotify without leaving the Telegram app, making it convenient to control music playback while chatting or working.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Telegram and Spotify accounts.
3. Set up a Telegram bot to receive messages.
4. Test the workflow by sending a song request to your Telegram bot.
5. Ensure the song plays on Spotify and the correct message is returned to Telegram.

### Practice
Create a test Telegram bot and send it messages with song descriptions. Observe how the workflow processes the request and handles both found and not found scenarios. Adjust song descriptions to test the workflow's robustness.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer unique music automation services, enhancing user experiences by integrating music control into messaging apps. This skill can attract customers looking for innovative solutions, helping you expand your automation business and generate income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, openAiApi, spotifyOAuth2Api.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
