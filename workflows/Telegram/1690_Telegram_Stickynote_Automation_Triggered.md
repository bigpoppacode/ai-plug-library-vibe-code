# Telegram Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using spotify×5, set×3, telegramTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Telegram Trigger**.
2. **Telegram Trigger** `telegramTrigger` — updates: "message", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "254.05813953488382", content: "## Telegram to Spotify 
Ask AI about a track with artist and song name or if you can't remember describe it and AI does it's thing.
"
4. **OpenAI - Ask about a track** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
5. **Search track** `spotify` — resource: **track**, operation: **search**
6. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Add song** `spotify` — id: "=spotify:track:{{ $json.id }}"
8. **Not found error message** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "{
 "error": "Song not found"
}
"
9. **Next Song** `spotify` — operation: **nextSong**
10. **Resume play** `spotify` — operation: **resume**
11. **Currently Playing** `spotify` — operation: **currentlyPlaying**
12. **Define Now Playing** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "={
 "error": "Now playing {{ $json.item.name }} - {{ $json.item.artists[0].name }} - {{ $json.item.album.name }}"
}
"
13. **Message parser** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combineBy: "combineAll"
15. **Return message to Telegram** `telegram` — text: "={{ $('Message parser').item.json.message }}", chatId: "={{ $json.message.chat.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow integrates Telegram and Spotify with AI. When a user sends a message in Telegram asking about a song, the workflow uses OpenAI to identify the song details. It then searches Spotify for the track, adds it to a playlist, and plays it if found. If not found, it sends an error message back to Telegram.

### Demonstrate
A music enthusiast could use this workflow to quickly find and play songs they remember only partially, enhancing their listening experience without needing to manually search Spotify.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Telegram and Spotify accounts.
3. Set up a Telegram bot to trigger the workflow.
4. Customize the OpenAI prompt for track identification.
5. Test by sending song requests via Telegram.

### Practice
Create a small Telegram group, invite your bot, and send different song descriptions. Observe how accurately the workflow identifies and plays the songs. Adjust the OpenAI prompt to improve accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a unique music discovery service, attracting music lovers or professionals needing quick access to tracks. This can lead to new business opportunities in music curation or entertainment services, boosting your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, openAiApi, spotifyOAuth2Api.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
