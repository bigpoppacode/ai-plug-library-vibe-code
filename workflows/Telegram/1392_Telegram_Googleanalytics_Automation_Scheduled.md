# Telegram Googleanalytics Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Calculator** `toolCalculator` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "560", content: "Welcome to my Google Analytics Weekly Report Workflow!

This workflow has the following sequence:

1. time trigger (e.g. every Monday at 7 a.m.)
2. retrieval of Google Analytics da…[truncated]"
5. **Google Analytics Letzte 7 Tage** `googleAnalytics` — metricsGA4: "[object Object]", propertyId: "[object Object]", dimensionsGA4: "[object Object]"
6. **Assign data** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
7. **Summarize Data** `summarize` — options: "[object Object]", fieldsToSummarize: "[object Object]"
8. **Calculation same period previous year** `code` — jsCode: "return {
 // Berechnung des Startdatums: Vorjahr, gleiche Woche, 7 Tage zurück
 startDate: (() => {
 const date = new Date();
 date.setFullYear(date.getFullYear() - 1); // Zurück i…[truncated]"
9. **Google Analytics: Past 7 days of the previous year** `googleAnalytics` — endDate: "={{ $json.endDate }}", dateRange: "custom", startDate: "={{ $json.startDate }}"
10. **Assign data1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Summarize Data1** `summarize` — options: "[object Object]", fieldsToSummarize: "[object Object]"
12. **Processing for email** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
13. **Send Email** `emailSend` — html: "={{ $json.message.content }}", options: "[object Object]", subject: "Weekly Report: Google Analytics: Last 7 days"
14. **Processing for Telegram** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
15. **Telegram** `telegram` — text: "={{ $json.message.content }}", chatId: "1810565648", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a weekly Google Analytics report. Every Monday at 7 a.m., it retrieves data from the past seven days and the same period from the previous year, summarizes it, and uses AI to format the data into an email and a Telegram message. The email report is sent to a specified address, and the Telegram message is sent to a chat.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically send weekly performance updates to their team, ensuring everyone is aligned on website analytics without manual data processing.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Google Analytics, email, and Telegram accounts.
3. Set up the schedule trigger for Monday 7 a.m.
4. Customize the email and Telegram message content.
5. Test the workflow by running it manually.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Google Analytics account and simulate data for the past week. Run the workflow and verify the email and Telegram messages reflect the test data accurately.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow helps you provide automated reporting solutions to clients, enhancing their decision-making while reducing manual work. This can lead to new service offerings and increased revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleAnalyticsOAuth2, smtp, telegramApi, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
