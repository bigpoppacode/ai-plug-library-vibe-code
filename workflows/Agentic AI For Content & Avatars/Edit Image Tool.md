# Edit Image Tool
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, googleDrive×2, executeWorkflowTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When Executed by Another Workflow**.
2. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — content: "# Edit Image
", height: "260", width: "460"
4. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — content: "# Send Content", height: "240", width: "300"
5. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — content: "# Write to Drive", height: "240", width: "300"
6. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — content: "# Trigger
", height: "260", width: "260"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — content: "# Download
", height: "260", width: "220"
8. **Download** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
9. **Edit Image** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/images/edits`
10. **Convert to File** `convertToFile` — operation: **toBinary**
11. **Send Photo** `telegram` — operation: **sendPhoto**
12. **Upload Image** `googleDrive` — name: "={{ $('When Executed by Another Workflow').item.json.image }} (Edited).png", driveId: "[object Object]", folderId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This n8n workflow automates the process of editing images. It begins when triggered by another workflow, downloading an image from Google Drive, sending it to the OpenAI API for editing based on a provided prompt, converting the edited image to a binary file, and then either sending the edited image via Telegram or uploading it back to Google Drive.

**Demonstrate**: A graphic design agency could use this workflow to automatically enhance images based on client requests. By automating the editing process, they can quickly deliver high-quality images, saving time and satisfying clients faster.

**Imitate**: To apply this workflow:
1. Import it into n8n.
2. Connect Google Drive and Telegram accounts.
3. Set up the trigger workflow to pass image data and editing prompts.
4. Test the workflow with sample images to ensure correct execution.

**Practice**: Create a test Google Drive folder with images. Use the workflow to edit these images, experimenting with different prompts to see how the OpenAI API modifies the images. Check the results in Telegram and Google Drive.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow lets you offer automated image editing services, enhancing your productivity and service offerings. This can attract more clients and increase your income, especially if you package it as part of a broader AI automation service.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, googleDriveOAuth2Api, telegramApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
