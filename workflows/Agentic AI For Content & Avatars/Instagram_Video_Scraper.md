# Instagram Video Scraper
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **search**, table: `[object Object]`
4. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `[redacted]`
5. **HTTP Request1** `httpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`
6. **Download Video** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $('HTTP Request1').item.json.videoUrl }}`
7. **Code** `code` — jsCode: "// Process all items that are coming in
const items = [];

// Loop through each input item
for (const item of $input.all()) {
  // Clone the item to avoid reference issues
  const …[truncated]"
8. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **audio**, operation: **transcribe**
9. **Airtable1** `airtable` — operation: **create**, table: `[object Object]`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping Instagram videos. It starts by retrieving Instagram account data from Airtable, then uses an API to scrape video content from Instagram accounts. The videos are downloaded, processed, and transcribed using OpenAI, and the results, including video metadata and transcriptions, are stored back in Airtable.

### Demonstrate
A content creator could use this workflow to regularly gather and analyze Instagram video content from competitors or influencers to understand trending themes, engagement strategies, and popular hashtags.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and OpenAI accounts.
3. Configure the API call with your Instagram scraper API key.
4. Customize the Airtable fields to match your data structure.
5. Test the workflow by manually triggering it to ensure it collects and processes the data correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Airtable base with Instagram account URLs. Run the workflow and verify that it downloads videos, transcribes them, and updates Airtable with video details and transcriptions. Experiment by adding new accounts to see how the workflow scales.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer services like social media monitoring and competitive analysis, adding value to your clients' marketing strategies. This can lead to increased client retention and new revenue streams in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableTokenApi, openAiApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
