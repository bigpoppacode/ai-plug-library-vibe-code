# Veo Automation
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Execute workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Execute workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/a907bf5f-80a0-4042-bab5-5927dcda3e6a`
5. **Edit Fields** `set` — assignments: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
6. **AI Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json['Pain Point'] }}
{{ $json.Setting }}
{{ $json.Avatar }}
{{ $json['Client Name'] }}

", options: "[object Object]"
7. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/veo3`
8. **Wait** `wait` — configured for its default action.
9. **HTTP Request1** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/veo3/requests/{{ $json.request_id }}`
10. **Gmail** `gmail` — sendTo: "={{ $json.Email }}", subject: "Your Video is ready 🤙", message: "=Here you go, brother:{{ $json.video.url }}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the creation and delivery of personalized video messages. It begins with a manual trigger, where user inputs such as the client's name, their pain point, and a character avatar are set. The OpenAI model generates a script for a video based on these inputs. The workflow then sends this script to an external service to create the video. Finally, once the video is ready, it is emailed to the client.

**Demonstrate**  
A marketing consultant could use this workflow to automate personalized video outreach campaigns, enhancing client engagement with tailored messages. This saves time and ensures consistency across communications.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up your OpenAI and email credentials.  
3. Customize the input fields to match your client's details.  
4. Test the workflow with a sample client to ensure the video is generated and sent correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test client profile with a fictional pain point and avatar. Run the workflow to generate a video, then check your email to see the result. Adjust the inputs and observe the changes in the output video.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer personalized video marketing services, adding value to clients' campaigns. This can differentiate your business, attract new customers, and increase revenue through premium service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
