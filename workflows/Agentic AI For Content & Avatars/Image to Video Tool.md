# Image To Video Tool
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When Executed by Another Workflow**.
2. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — content: "# Trigger
", height: "260", width: "212"
4. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — content: "# Download
", height: "260", width: "476"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — content: "# Generate Video

", height: "260", width: "764"
6. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — content: "# Send Content", height: "240", width: "300"
7. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — content: "# Write to Drive", height: "240", width: "300"
8. **Share file** `googleDrive` — operation: **share**
9. **Download file** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
10. **Get URL** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload`
11. **Generate Video** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/veo3/fast/image-to-video`
12. **1 Minute** `wait` — amount: "1", unit: "minutes"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a video from an image. It starts when another workflow triggers it, downloads an image from Google Drive, uploads it to IMGBB to get a URL, and uses this URL to generate a video with an external API. The video is then uploaded back to Google Drive and sent via Telegram.

### Demonstrate
A content creator could use this workflow to automate the generation of promotional videos from static images, reducing manual work and speeding up content production.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Drive and Telegram accounts.
3. Set up another workflow to trigger this one.
4. Adjust the URLs and credentials in the HTTP Request nodes.
5. Test the workflow by executing it with a sample image.

### Practice
Create a sample image in Google Drive and execute the workflow. Verify that a video is generated and uploaded back to Google Drive and sent via Telegram. Modify inputs to see different outputs.

### WIIFM
By mastering this workflow, you can offer automated video creation services, enhancing your portfolio and enabling you to capture the growing demand for video content in marketing. This can lead to new client opportunities and increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, googleDriveOAuth2Api, httpQueryAuth, telegramApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
