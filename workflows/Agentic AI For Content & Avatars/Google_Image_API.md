# Google Image API
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using googleDrive×2, httpRequest, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Google Drive1** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
4. **Extract from File** `extractFromFile` — operation: **binaryToPropery**
5. **HTTP Request3** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation:generateContent?key=INSERTKEY`
6. **Code1** `code` — jsCode: "const base64Data = $node["HTTP Request3"].json.candidates[0].content.parts[0].inlineData.data;
const mimeType = $node["HTTP Request3"].json.candidates[0].content.parts[0].inlineDat…[truncated]"
7. **Google Drive2** `googleDrive` — name: "file_updated.png", driveId: "[object Object]", folderId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates image editing using AI. It downloads an image from Google Drive, processes it via a generative AI model to alter specific content (like changing people to aliens in the background), and saves the edited image back to Google Drive. It's a seamless process that leverages AI to modify images as per given instructions.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to quickly generate creative variations of images for marketing materials, saving time on manual editing and enabling rapid iteration and experimentation with different concepts.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Drive account.
3. Set up the API key for the generative AI service.
4. Define the image and the specific editing instructions.
5. Run the workflow and check the updated image in Google Drive.

### Practice
Create a new Google Drive folder with sample images. Use the workflow to edit these images with different AI instructions, such as changing backgrounds or adding elements. Observe how the AI modifies the images and experiment with various prompts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated image editing services, reducing manual labor and enhancing creativity. This can attract clients in media, marketing, and advertising sectors, leading to increased revenue opportunities in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
