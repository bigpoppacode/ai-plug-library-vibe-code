  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is triggered when a new appointment is scheduled in Acuity Scheduling. It listens for the "appointment.scheduled" event, which means whenever an appointment is booked, this workflow can be activated to perform any subsequent actions you design, such as sending confirmation emails or updating a CRM with the new appointment details.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to automate follow-up emails or SMS notifications when a client books an appointment through Acuity Scheduling. This ensures timely communication and improves client experience by confirming the booking and providing any necessary details or reminders.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Acuity Scheduling account using the required API credentials.
3. Customize actions to take place after an appointment is scheduled, such as sending an email or updating a database.
4. Test the workflow by scheduling a test appointment in Acuity.

### Practice
Set up a test appointment in Acuity Scheduling and observe how the workflow triggers. Add nodes to send yourself a confirmation email or log the appointment details in a Google Sheet to see how data flows through the workflow.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
