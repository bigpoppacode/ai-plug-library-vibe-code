# Emailreadimap NextCloud Send
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Map each attachment**.
  2. **Map each attachment** `function` — functionCode: "const _ = require('lodash')

const sanitize = str => _.chain(str)
  .replace(/[^A-Za-z0-9&.-]/g, '-') // sanitise via whitelist of characters
  .replace(/-(?=-)/g, '') // remove re…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of downloading email attachments from an "Invoices" mailbox using IMAP, sanitizing their filenames, and then uploading them to Nextcloud. It ensures filenames are clean and consistent by removing unwanted characters and limiting their length.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to automatically organize invoices received via email, ensuring all attachments are stored in a structured and accessible manner on their Nextcloud server.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the IMAP Email node with your email credentials and specify the "Invoices" mailbox.
3. Customize the Nextcloud node to point to your server and desired storage path.
4. Ensure the function node is correctly sanitizing filenames.
5. Activate and test the workflow.

### Practice
Create a test email with an attachment named "Invoice_123.pdf" and send it to your email. Run the workflow and check if the attachment is sanitized and uploaded to Nextcloud with the correct naming format.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email attachment organization services, helping businesses maintain orderly digital records. This can enhance your service portfolio and attract clients looking for efficient document management solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
