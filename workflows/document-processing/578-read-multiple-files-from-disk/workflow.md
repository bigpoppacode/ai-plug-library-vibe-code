# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, readBinaryFiles.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Read Binary Files (readBinaryFiles)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading binary files (like images) from a specified directory when manually triggered. It's useful for tasks like processing images or files in bulk without needing manual intervention for each file.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically read and process customer-uploaded product images from a website, saving time and ensuring consistency in handling files.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Read Binary Files** node.
4. Set the file path in the Read Binary Files node (e.g., `/data/uploads/*.jpg`).
5. Connect the Manual Trigger to the Read Binary Files node.
6. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the file path in the Read Binary Files node to point to a different directory with text files. Execute the workflow to see how it reads those files and check the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate file handling tasks, increasing efficiency and accuracy in your operations. This skill is valuable for creating automation solutions, attracting clients, and generating income in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Read Binary Files" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
