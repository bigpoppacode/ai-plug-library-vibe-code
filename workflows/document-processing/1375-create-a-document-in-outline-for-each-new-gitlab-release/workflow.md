# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving gitlabTrigger, httpRequest, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Gitlab Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Gitlab Trigger (gitlabTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of triggering actions when a new tag is pushed in a GitLab repository. It first checks if the event is a release. If it is, it sends an HTTP request to create a document in Outline with details about the release.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate documentation of software releases. Instead of manually creating release notes, the workflow captures relevant information from GitLab and generates a structured document, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the GitLab Trigger with your repository details.
3. Customize the HTTP Request to match your documentation platform (e.g., Outline).
4. Adjust the IF node to check for your specific event type (e.g., release).
5. Test the workflow by pushing a tag in GitLab.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log additional release information, such as contributors or changes. Push a tag with a new release in GitLab and check if the document reflects these changes accurately in Outline.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline the release documentation process, saving you and your clients valuable time. It enhances productivity, reduces human error, and can be packaged as a service, adding value to your automation offerings and increasing potential revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Gitlab Trigger" and "IF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
