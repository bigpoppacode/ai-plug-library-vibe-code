# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, ftp, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: FTP (ftp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: FTP1 (ftp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading an image from a URL and uploading it to an FTP server. It starts when manually triggered, fetches the image via an HTTP request, and then uploads it to a specified FTP directory, ensuring efficient file management.

### Demonstrate
A web design agency might use this workflow to automate image uploads. Instead of manually downloading and uploading images for client projects, they can trigger this workflow to streamline the process, saving time and effort while maintaining organization in their FTP server.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert an **HTTP Request** node to fetch an image (set the URL).
4. Add an **FTP** node to upload the image (configure FTP credentials and path).
5. Connect nodes: Trigger → HTTP Request → FTP.
6. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to download and upload a different file type (like a PDF). Change the URL in the HTTP Request node and adjust the FTP upload path accordingly. Execute the workflow to see how it handles various file types.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, making file management more efficient. This skill can help you attract clients by offering tailored automation solutions, ultimately increasing your income potential as an automation consultant or service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
