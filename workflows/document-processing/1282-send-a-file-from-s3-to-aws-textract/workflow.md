# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, awsTextract, awsS3.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: AWS Textract (awsTextract)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: AWS S3 (awsS3)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing a document using AWS Textract and storing the results in AWS S3. It starts when you manually trigger it, retrieves a file from S3, and then processes it with Textract for text extraction.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate invoice processing. Instead of manually extracting data from invoices, the workflow fetches the invoice image from S3, uses Textract to extract text, and saves the results back to S3 for further processing or storage.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **AWS S3** node to fetch your document (set the bucket and file key).
4. Add an **AWS Textract** node to analyze the document.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see it in action.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to process different document types (e.g., receipts or contracts) by changing the file key in the AWS S3 node and adjusting the Textract parameters accordingly. Execute the workflow and check the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline document processing for businesses, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract clients looking for automation solutions, potentially increasing your income through consulting or service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "AWS S3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
