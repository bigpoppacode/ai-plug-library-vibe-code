# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, functionItem, readBinaryFile.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Config (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Read Binary File (readBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: BinaryToJSON (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: ReturnValue (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading a binary file, converting it to JSON format, and returning specific values. It begins with a manual trigger, processes the file, and uses JavaScript to extract and return defined data.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate data extraction from uploaded files (like CSVs) in their app, saving time spent on manual data entry or analysis, and ensuring consistent data processing.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Function Item** node to configure file paths and keys.
4. Use a **Read Binary File** node to read the file.
5. Add a **Move Binary Data** node to convert to JSON.
6. Use a final **Function Item** node to return specific values.

### Practice
Try uploading a sample binary file (like a text document) to test the workflow. Modify the JavaScript in the Function Item nodes to extract different pieces of data and see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide automation services that save clients time and reduce errors in data processing, making you a valuable resource in the growing field of AI automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "ReturnValue" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
