# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, openAi, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Split In Batches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Parse JSON (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Make JSON Table (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Convert to CSV (spreadsheetFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Save to Disk (writeBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Strip UTF BOM bytes (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Create valid binary (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating mock user data using OpenAI, formatting it into CSV files, and saving it to disk. It starts when you manually trigger it, then calls OpenAI to create user data, processes that data, and ultimately saves it as CSV files on your computer.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly generate test data for a new application or service without manually creating each entry. For example, when preparing for a demo, they can generate realistic user data to showcase features.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the workflow.
3. Insert an **OpenAI** node with a prompt for generating user data.
4. Follow with a **Split In Batches** node to handle multiple entries.
5. Use **Parse JSON**, **Make JSON Table**, and **Convert to CSV** nodes to format the data.
6. Add a **Save to Disk** node to store the CSV files.
7. Execute the workflow to generate and save the data.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the OpenAI node to generate different types of data (like product reviews or event registrations). Execute the workflow and check the saved CSV files to see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer data generation as a service, saving businesses time and resources. You can attract clients needing test data for applications, thus creating an additional income stream for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
