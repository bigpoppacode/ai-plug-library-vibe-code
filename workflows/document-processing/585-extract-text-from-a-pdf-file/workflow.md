# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, readBinaryFile, readPDF.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Read Binary File (readBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Read PDF (readPDF)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading a PDF file when triggered manually. It starts from a manual trigger, reads the binary file from a specified path, and then processes the PDF content for further actions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate invoice processing. When an invoice PDF is uploaded, the workflow reads the file and extracts relevant data, saving time and reducing manual data entry errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Read Binary File** node, specifying the path to your PDF.
4. Add a **Read PDF** node to process the binary data.
5. Connect the nodes and save the workflow.

### Practice
Try uploading a sample PDF file to the specified path and execute the workflow. Check the output of the Read PDF node to see if it successfully extracts the content from the PDF.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate tedious file processing tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract more clients by offering efficient document management solutions in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Read PDF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
