# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, readBinaryFile.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Read Binary File (readBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger and reads a binary file (like an image). It’s useful for automating tasks that involve file handling, such as processing images or documents in a business context.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate uploading a logo (binary file) to a cloud storage or sending it via email, saving time and ensuring consistency in handling files.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Read Binary File** node and specify the file path (e.g., `/data/logo.png`).
4. Connect the two nodes.
5. Execute the workflow to test.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to read a different file type, like a PDF. Change the file path in the **Read Binary File** node and check if it processes correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to handle file automation efficiently, which can attract clients needing document processing or digital asset management, increasing your service offerings and potential income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Read Binary File" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
