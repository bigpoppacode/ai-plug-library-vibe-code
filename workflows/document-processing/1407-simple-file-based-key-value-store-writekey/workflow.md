# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, writeBinaryFile, functionItem.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Write Binary File (writeBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Config (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Read Binary Files (readBinaryFiles)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: SetKeyValue (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: BinaryToJSON (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: JSONToBinary (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: SplitInBatches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Repeat (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Done (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling files. It starts by manually triggering an execution, writing a binary file, reading it, transforming the data between binary and JSON formats, and finally processing the data in batches before completing the workflow.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate file processing tasks, such as uploading customer data files, transforming them for analysis, and storing results in a database, saving time and reducing manual errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Insert a Write Binary File node for file uploads.
4. Use Read Binary Files to access the uploaded file.
5. Convert binary to JSON and back as needed with the BinaryToJSON and JSONToBinary nodes.
6. Add SplitInBatches for processing in smaller chunks.
7. Finish with a Done node to signal completion.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to read a different type of file (like CSV) instead of a binary file. Adjust the Write and Read nodes accordingly, and test the workflow to see how it handles different data formats.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate file handling processes, increasing efficiency and accuracy in data management. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, ultimately generating income through your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Done" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
