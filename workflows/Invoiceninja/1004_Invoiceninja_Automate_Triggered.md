  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is triggered whenever a new invoice is created in Invoice Ninja. It uses the "Invoice Ninja Trigger" node to listen for the "create_invoice" event. Once an invoice is created, this workflow can be expanded with additional nodes to automate tasks like sending notifications, updating records in other systems, or performing follow-up actions.

### Demonstrate
A freelancer could use this workflow to automate the process of sending a thank-you email to clients every time an invoice is created. This ensures timely communication and enhances client relationships without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Invoice Ninja account using the provided credentials.
3. Add nodes to perform desired actions, like sending an email or updating a CRM.
4. Set up the workflow to trigger on invoice creation.
5. Test the workflow with a sample invoice to verify functionality.

### Practice
Create a test invoice in Invoice Ninja to trigger the workflow. Add a node to send yourself a notification email and observe if it triggers correctly. Experiment with adding additional actions, like logging the event in a Google Sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate client-facing interactions, improving efficiency and client satisfaction. This can enhance your service offerings and potentially increase income by providing seamless, automated client management solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
