# HTTP Schedule Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **TWETTER** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "880", height: "300"
5. **Get my video** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
6. **Assign Social Media IDs** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "{
  "instagram_id": "111",
  "youtube_id": "222",
  "tiktok_id": "333",
  "facebook_id": "444",
  "facebook_page_id": "555",
  "threads_id": "666",
  "twitter_id": "777",
  "linked…[truncated]"
7. **Upload Video to Blotato** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/media`
8. **INSTAGRAM** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
9. **YOUTUBE** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
10. **TIKTOK** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
11. **FACEBOOK** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
12. **THREADS** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
13. **LINKEDIN** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
14. **BLUESKY** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
15. **PINTEREST** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://backend.blotato.com/v2/posts`
16. **Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of video distribution across multiple social media platforms. It begins with a scheduled trigger that retrieves video details from a Google Sheets document. The video is then uploaded to Blotato, a platform that facilitates mass distribution. Following the upload, the video gets posted to various social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Threads, Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky, and Pinterest. Finally, the Google Sheets document is updated to reflect the completion status of the video posting.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to efficiently manage their social media presence by automatically publishing promotional videos across multiple platforms, saving time and ensuring consistent content distribution.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Blotato accounts.
3. Configure the scheduled trigger for your desired posting time.
4. Map the Google Sheets fields to match your video details.
5. Test the workflow to ensure videos publish correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheets document with sample video URLs and descriptions. Run the workflow to see how it retrieves data, uploads videos to Blotato, and posts them across social media. Adjust the schedule and fields to see their effects.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated social media management services, attracting clients who want to streamline their content distribution. This can lead to increased revenue and client satisfaction in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
