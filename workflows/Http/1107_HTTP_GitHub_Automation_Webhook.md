# HTTP Github Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×17, function×4, cron.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Massage GitHub Data**.
  2. **Massage GitHub Data** `function` — functionCode: "items[0].json.stargazers_count = items[0].json.stargazers_count.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ",");
items[0].json.subscribers_count = items[0].json.subscribers_count.…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the collection and processing of data from various sources, such as GitHub, Docker, npm, and Product Hunt, to update a dashboard. It retrieves data on metrics like stars, forks, and issues from GitHub, pull and star counts from Docker, and package scores from npm. The workflow formats the data for display and sends updates to a specified dashboard.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer could use this workflow to monitor the popularity and usage of their open-source project across various platforms, keeping an updated dashboard that helps in tracking growth and user engagement.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your accounts for GitHub, Docker, npm, and Product Hunt.  
3. Update the dashboard configuration with your dashboard's details.  
4. Set the cron trigger to your preferred schedule.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates your dashboard correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a GitHub repository and use this workflow to track its metrics. Observe how the data is formatted and sent to your dashboard. Experiment with different data points to see how they affect your dashboard updates.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer dashboard automation services, providing clients with real-time insights into their projects' performance. This can enhance decision-making, attract more users, and potentially increase revenue, benefiting your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
