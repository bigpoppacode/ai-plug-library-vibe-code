# HTTP Schedule Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, nextCloud, scheduleTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "900", height: "380", content: "## Copy Scanner Documents to Nextcloud
** Needed USB-Scanner and Program ScanServJS with an API"
4. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/v1/files`
5. **HTTP Request1** `httpRequest` — url: `=http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/v1/files/{{ $json.name }}`
6. **Nextcloud** `nextCloud` — path: `/=/Scans/{{ $json.name }}`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of transferring documents from a scanner to Nextcloud. It is triggered on a set schedule, uses HTTP requests to fetch scanned documents from a local server running ScanServJS, and uploads them to a designated folder in Nextcloud. This ensures that scanned documents are organized and backed up automatically.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to ensure that all scanned invoices and documents are automatically stored in Nextcloud for easy access and backup. This saves time and prevents the loss of important documents.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a schedule trigger to define when the workflow should run.
3. Configure HTTP Request nodes to fetch scanned documents from your server.
4. Connect your Nextcloud account and set the upload path.
5. Test the workflow to ensure documents are correctly uploaded.

### Practice
Create a test folder in Nextcloud and use a few sample documents on your server. Run the workflow manually or on a schedule to see how documents are transferred and stored in the designated Nextcloud folder. Adjust settings as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated document management solutions to clients, improving their operational efficiency. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and potential upsells in your automation business, enhancing your service portfolio.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** nextCloudApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
