# HTTP Rabbitmq Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using rabbitmq, set, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute and sends the data to a RabbitMQ topic. It uses a Cron node to trigger an HTTP request to an API that provides the ISS's latitude, longitude, and timestamp. The data is then formatted and sent to RabbitMQ for further processing or distribution.

### Demonstrate
A space research organization could use this workflow to continuously track the ISS's position for real-time monitoring and data analysis, helping them coordinate experiments or educational broadcasts.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Cron node to trigger every minute.
3. Configure the HTTP Request node with the ISS API URL.
4. Map the API response data in the Set node.
5. Set up RabbitMQ credentials and queue in the RabbitMQ node.
6. Test the workflow to ensure data is published correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple RabbitMQ consumer that logs the ISS position data to a text file. Run the workflow and observe how the data is updated every minute. Experiment with changing the interval or adding additional data fields from the API.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time data streaming solutions, which are valuable for clients needing continuous monitoring systems. This skill can expand your service offerings and attract clients in aerospace, logistics, or IoT, enhancing your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** rabbitmq.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
