# HTTP Discord Import Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **@Get Date 1 min ago**.
  2. **@Get Date 1 min ago** `function` — functionCode: "const date = new Date(new Date().setMinutes(new Date().getMinutes() - (1))).toISOString()
return [{json: {since: date}}];"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow checks for new GitHub notifications every minute. It uses a function to get the current time minus one minute, then fetches notifications from GitHub since that time. If there are new notifications, it compiles them into a message and sends it to a designated Discord channel.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer can use this workflow to stay updated on team activity in a GitHub repository, ensuring they never miss important updates or issues that need attention.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub and Discord accounts.
3. Set up the Cron node to trigger every minute.
4. Customize the Discord node to tag relevant users.
5. Test the workflow to ensure notifications are sent correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a GitHub repository and generate some activity (e.g., open issues). Run the workflow to see how it captures and reports these notifications in Discord.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow helps you offer real-time notification services, improving team communication and response time. This can enhance your service offerings in a tech consultancy or automation business, leading to potential client retention and expansion.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
