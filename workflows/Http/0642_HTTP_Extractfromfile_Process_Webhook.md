# HTTP Extractfromfile Process Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, httpRequest×2, set×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "187.37066290133808", height: "80", content: "**Add direct link to CV and Job description**"
4. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280.2462120317618", height: "438.5821431288714"
5. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "636.2128494576581", height: "598.6675280064023"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "330.5152611046425", height: "240.6839895136402"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "187.37066290133808", height: "80", content: "**Replace OpenAI connection**"
8. **Set Variables** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Download File** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.file_url }}`
10. **Extract Document PDF** `extractFromFile` — operation: **pdf**
11. **OpenAI - Analyze CV** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
12. **Parsed JSON** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing CVs using OpenAI. It downloads a CV from a given URL, extracts the text from the PDF, and sends this text along with a job description to OpenAI's API. The API evaluates the CV, providing a matching score, a summary of the candidate's strengths and weaknesses, and insights into their suitability for the job. The results are then parsed and can be used for further processing or storage.

**Demonstrate:**  
A recruitment agency could use this workflow to quickly screen a large number of CVs against specific job descriptions, saving time and ensuring consistency in the evaluation process.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n setup.  
2. Replace the OpenAI API credentials with your own.  
3. Set the URL in the "Set Variables" node to point to your CV file.  
4. Update the job description in the workflow to fit your needs.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it evaluates the CV correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test scenario by using a sample CV and job description. Run the workflow and compare the results with manual evaluation to understand how OpenAI analyzes the CV. Tweak the workflow parameters to improve accuracy.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate CV screening, enhancing your recruitment services. This can attract more clients, improve service efficiency, and increase revenue by offering AI-powered candidate evaluations as part of your business solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
