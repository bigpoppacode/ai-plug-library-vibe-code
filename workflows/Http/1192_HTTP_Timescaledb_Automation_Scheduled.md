# HTTP TimescaleDB Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow tracks the International Space Station's (ISS) position every minute. It uses a Cron node to trigger an HTTP request to an API that provides the ISS's latitude, longitude, and timestamp. This data is then formatted using a Set node and stored in a TimescaleDB for further analysis or visualization.

- **Demonstrate**: A space research organization could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position in real-time, allowing them to schedule communications or experiments when the station is overhead, optimizing operations and resource allocation.

- **Imitate**: To apply this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your TimescaleDB credentials, and adjust the API endpoint or database table if needed. Test the workflow by enabling it, and ensure the ISS data is correctly logged in your database.

- **Practice**: Set up a test database and run this workflow for a day. Check the database entries to see how the ISS's position changes over time. Experiment by modifying the interval or adding additional data processing steps.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow equips you to offer real-time data tracking solutions, a valuable service for clients needing continuous data updates, such as logistics or environmental monitoring companies. This can enhance your service offerings and open new revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** timescaleDb.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
