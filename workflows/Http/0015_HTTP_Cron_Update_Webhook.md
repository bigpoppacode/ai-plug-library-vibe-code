# HTTP Cron Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using cron, httpRequest, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **AMQP Sender**.
  2. **AMQP Sender** `amqp` — sink: "iss-postition", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending the International Space Station's (ISS) position to an ActiveMQ topic every minute. It uses a Cron node to trigger an HTTP request fetching the ISS's current geographic coordinates and timestamp. These details are then formatted and sent to an AMQP topic, ensuring real-time updates of the ISS's position.

### Demonstrate
A space research organization could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position in real-time for research purposes or to coordinate satellite communication, ensuring data accuracy and timely updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your ActiveMQ credentials in the AMQP Sender node.
3. Customize the HTTP Request URL if needed.
4. Activate the workflow to start sending data every minute.
5. Monitor the ActiveMQ topic to ensure data is being received.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow using a Cron node to fetch and log weather data from an API every hour. This will reinforce understanding of scheduling tasks and handling API requests in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time data solutions to clients, enhancing their operational efficiency and decision-making capabilities. This can expand your service offerings and increase your value as an automation consultant, leading to higher income opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** amqp.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
