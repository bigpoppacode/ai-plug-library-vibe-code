# HTTP MySQL Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **roloProduto**.
  2. **roloProduto** `merge` — mode: "mergeByKey", propertyName1: "id_movimentacao_detalhe", propertyName2: "id_movimentacao_detalhe"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to manage product and roll data by merging information from a product database and a roll database. It starts with a webhook to trigger the process, retrieves product details from a MySQL database, and roll details from a PostgreSQL database. The workflow then merges this data based on a common key, `id_movimentacao_detalhe`, ensuring that all relevant product and roll information is consolidated for further processing or reporting.

### Demonstrate
A textile company could use this workflow to track and manage inventory. By merging product and roll data, the company ensures accurate inventory records, which helps in planning production and managing stock levels efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
3. Set up the webhook to trigger the workflow.
4. Customize the SQL queries to match your database schema.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it merges data correctly based on your criteria.

### Practice
Create a small test database with sample product and roll data. Run the workflow to see how it merges the data. Adjust the queries and keys to observe changes in the merged output, ensuring you understand how the merge operation works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient data management solutions to businesses, particularly those in manufacturing and inventory management. It can enhance operational efficiency, leading to better client retention and opportunities to expand your automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mySql, postgres.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
