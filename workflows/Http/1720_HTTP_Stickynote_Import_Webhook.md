# HTTP Stickynote Import Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using executeWorkflowTrigger, httpRequest, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute Workflow Trigger**.
  2. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "620", height: "200", content: "## Send URL got Crawl
This can be reused by Ai Agents and any Workspace to crawl a site. All that Workspace has to do is send a request:

```json
 {
 "url": "Some URL to Get"
 }
``…[truncated]"
4. **FireCrawl** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape`
5. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of web scraping by sending a specified URL to the FireCrawl API. It begins with a trigger to execute the workflow, sends a POST request to FireCrawl to scrape the provided URL, and then processes the response to extract and format the data into markdown. This setup allows users to easily gather and structure web data for further use.

### Demonstrate
A content creator might use this workflow to automatically gather and format data from various websites into markdown for easy integration into articles or reports, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Execute Workflow Trigger to define the URL you want to scrape.
3. Ensure the FireCrawl API credentials are configured.
4. Run the workflow to test it with your chosen URL, and review how the data is formatted.

### Practice
Create a test workflow to scrape a Wikipedia page. Observe how the data is returned in markdown format. Try changing the URL to see how different pages are processed, and adjust the markdown formatting as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer web scraping as a service, providing clients with valuable data extraction capabilities. This can enhance content strategies, improve data-driven decision-making, and open opportunities for additional income through automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
