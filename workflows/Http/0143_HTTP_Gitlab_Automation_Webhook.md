# HTTP GitLab Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using gitlabTrigger, httpRequest, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **IF**.
  2. **IF** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"

  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is set up to automatically create a document in Outline whenever a new release is tagged in a specified GitLab repository. It begins with a GitLab trigger that listens for "tag_push" events in the "ci-test" repository owned by "tennox". If the event is a "release", the workflow uses an HTTP Request node to send a POST request to Outline's API, creating a document with details about the release.

### Demonstrate
A software company could use this workflow to automatically document and publish release notes whenever a new version of their software is tagged in GitLab, ensuring that team members and stakeholders are immediately informed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitLab and Outline accounts.
3. Customize the GitLab trigger to your repository details.
4. Set up the HTTP Request node with your Outline API credentials.
5. Test the workflow by pushing a tag in your GitLab repository.

### Practice
Create a test GitLab repository and simulate a tag push event. Observe how the workflow triggers the creation of a new document in Outline. Modify the title or content structure in the HTTP Request node and test again.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate documentation processes, providing value to software teams by saving time and ensuring consistent communication. This skill can enhance your service offerings and attract clients looking for efficient release management solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
