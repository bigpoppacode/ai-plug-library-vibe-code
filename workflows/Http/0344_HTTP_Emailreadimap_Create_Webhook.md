# HTTP Emailreadimap Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://your.nextcloud.com/index.php/apps/deck/api/v1.0/boards/YOUR-BOARD-ID/stacks/YOUR-STACK-ID/cards`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automatically creates a new card in the Nextcloud Deck app from incoming emails. It checks for new emails, strips HTML from the email body to clean up the text, and then uses the cleaned data to create a card with the email's subject as the title and the cleaned body as the description.

**Demonstrate**  
A project manager could use this workflow to automatically convert emails into tasks on their Nextcloud Deck, ensuring no important communication is missed and facilitating better project tracking and management.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your email account using IMAP and set up the Nextcloud credentials.  
3. Customize the Nextcloud URL with your board and stack IDs.  
4. Test the workflow by sending an email to see if a card is created.

**Practice**  
Set up a test email account and send a few test emails with different subjects and bodies. Run the workflow and check if each email results in a new card on the Nextcloud Deck with the corresponding subject and body.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by automating task management from emails, reducing manual data entry, and improving efficiency. This capability can attract more clients looking for seamless email-to-task solutions, boosting your AI automation business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, httpBasicAuth.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
