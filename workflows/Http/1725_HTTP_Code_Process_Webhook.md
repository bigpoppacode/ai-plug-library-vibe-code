# HTTP Code Process Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest, webhook, stickyNote.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/convert`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "840", height: "580", content: "### ✅ **How to Use This Flow**

#### 📥 Trigger via File Upload

You can trigger this flow by sending a `POST` request with a file using **curl**, **Postman**, or **from another n8…[truncated]"
4. **Send to Parquet API** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.parquetreader.com/parquet?source=n8n`
5. **Parse API Response** `code` — jsCode: "const item = items[0];

// Convert `data` (stringified JSON array) → actual array
if (typeof item.json.data === 'string') {
  item.json.data = JSON.parse(item.json.data);
}

// Con…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow converts files in Parquet, Avro, ORC, or Feather formats to JSON. It starts with a Webhook that triggers when a file is uploaded. The file is sent to an API for conversion, and the response is parsed to extract data and metadata. The result is a JSON file that can be easily used in other applications for further processing or analysis.

### Demonstrate
A data analytics company could use this workflow to automate the conversion of large datasets from Parquet format to JSON, enabling easier data manipulation and integration into analytics tools.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Webhook to receive file uploads.
3. Connect the API endpoint for file conversion.
4. Customize the workflow to handle different file types.
5. Test the workflow with sample files to ensure correct conversion.

### Practice
Create a test file in Parquet format and upload it using a POST request to the Webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the file and outputs a JSON format, ensuring the data matches the original.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer data conversion services, streamlining data processing for clients. This can enhance your service offerings, attract new customers, and generate income by providing a valuable automation solution in data analytics.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
