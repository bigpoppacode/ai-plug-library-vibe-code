# HTTP Discord Monitor Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically checks a website every hour to see if a specific item is "Out Of Stock." It uses an HTTP request to get the website data and an IF node to check for the "Out Of Stock" phrase. If found, it sends a "value found" message to a Discord channel; if not, it sends a "value not found" message.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to monitor product availability on a competitor's website, ensuring they can adjust their inventory or marketing strategies accordingly.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the URL in the HTTP Request node to the website you want to monitor.
3. Enter your Discord webhook URI in the Discord nodes.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly identifies "Out Of Stock" and sends messages.

### Practice
Create a test webpage with the text "In Stock" and "Out Of Stock." Run the workflow and modify the text to see how the workflow responds, ensuring it sends the correct Discord messages.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer monitoring services to clients, helping them stay informed about stock levels or competitor activity. This could enhance your service offerings and increase your value as an automation consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
