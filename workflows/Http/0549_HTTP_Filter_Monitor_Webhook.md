# HTTP Filter Monitor Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, splitOut×2, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Stripe | Get latest checkout sessions1**.
  2. **Stripe | Get latest checkout sessions1** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions`
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "252.741654751449", height: "593.3373455805055"
4. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "451.2991079615292", height: "267.24226082469556"
5. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", height: "598.2429925878827", content: "## Select the custom fields you want

Here you can choose to filter your contacts to keep only the ones who contain certain custom_fields.

Let's say you only want the ones who hav…[truncated]"
6. **split all data** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "data"
7. **split custom_fields** `splitOut` — include: "allOtherFields", options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "custom_fields"
8. **Filter by custom_field** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves the latest checkout sessions from Stripe using an HTTP request. It processes the data by splitting it into individual records and then further divides each record's custom fields. The workflow filters the records based on specific custom field criteria, such as having a "nickname" and "job_title," ensuring that only relevant data is retained for further processing or analysis.

### Demonstrate
A small e-commerce business can use this workflow to analyze recent customer checkout sessions in Stripe, filtering them for specific customer attributes. This helps target marketing efforts to customers who have specific roles or characteristics, enhancing personalization and engagement.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Stripe account to the HTTP Request node.
3. Set up the filtering criteria in the Filter by custom_field node.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and processes the expected data.
5. Adjust the custom field filters to match your business needs.

### Practice
Create a test Stripe account and perform a few checkout sessions. Run the workflow to see how it processes and filters these sessions. Experiment by adjusting the custom field filters to see how different criteria affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer data analysis and targeted marketing services, enhancing client relationships and driving business growth. By leveraging automation, you can provide insights that improve customer engagement and increase revenue, expanding your offerings in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
