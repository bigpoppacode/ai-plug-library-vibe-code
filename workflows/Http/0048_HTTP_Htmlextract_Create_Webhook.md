# HTTP Htmlextract Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Register URL**.
  2. **Register URL** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"

  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of saving a URL to a Notion database from a webhook input. It first checks if the type is not equal to 1. If the type is valid, it fetches the URL from the incoming data, extracts the webpage title, and stores both the title and URL in a Notion database. Lastly, it sends a confirmation message to Discord.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the process of capturing URLs shared in a Discord channel and storing them in a Notion database for later review or content curation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook trigger to capture incoming data.
3. Configure the Notion and Discord nodes with appropriate credentials.
4. Map the incoming data to the Notion properties.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it functions correctly.

### Practice
Create a test webhook and send a POST request with a URL in the data. Verify that the URL and its title are correctly added to your Notion database and that a confirmation message is sent to Discord.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to automate data collection and organization tasks. This skill can be leveraged to offer services to clients, such as automating content management processes, thus adding value and potentially increasing your income in an automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
