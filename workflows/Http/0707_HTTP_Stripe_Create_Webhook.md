# HTTP Stripe Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×3, merge×3, stripe.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **New Payment**.
  2. **New Payment** `stripeTrigger` — events: "payment_intent.succeeded"
3. **Get Stripe Customer** `stripe` — resource: **customer**
4. **GET Quickbooks Customer** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com/v3/company/9341453851324714/query?query=select * from Customer Where PrimaryEmailAddr = '{{ $json.email }}'&minorversion=73

`
5. **If Customer Exists** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
6. **Merge Stripe and QuickBooks Data** `merge` — numberInputs: "3"
7. **Use Stripe Customer** `merge` — configured for its default action.
8. **POST Sales Receipt** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com/v3/company/9341453851324714/salesreceipt?minorversion=73`
9. **Create QuickBooks Customer** `quickbooks` — operation: **create**
10. **Merge Payment and QuickBooks Customer** `merge` — configured for its default action.
11. **POST Sales Receipt To QuickBooks** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com/v3/company/9341453851324714/salesreceipt?minorversion=73`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of synchronizing Stripe payments with QuickBooks. When a new payment is successfully processed on Stripe, it retrieves the customer details from Stripe. Then, it checks if the customer exists in QuickBooks. If the customer exists, it merges the payment data with QuickBooks customer data and creates a sales receipt in QuickBooks. If the customer does not exist, it creates a new customer in QuickBooks before generating a sales receipt.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically keep their QuickBooks records updated with new payments from Stripe, ensuring financial records are accurate and up-to-date without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Stripe and QuickBooks accounts.
3. Set up the Stripe Trigger for successful payments.
4. Customize the QuickBooks URLs and fields to match your data.
5. Test the workflow by simulating a payment to ensure it updates QuickBooks correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Stripe payment and observe how the workflow updates QuickBooks. Modify customer details to see how the workflow handles existing and new customers.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated financial record-keeping services to businesses, reducing manual entry errors and saving time. This can enhance your service offerings, leading to higher client satisfaction and potential income from automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** quickBooksOAuth2Api, httpCustomAuth, stripeApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
