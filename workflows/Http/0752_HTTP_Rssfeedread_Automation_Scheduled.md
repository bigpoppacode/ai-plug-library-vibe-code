# HTTP Rssfeedread Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using rssFeedRead, httpRequest, cron.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **NoOp**.
  2. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates posting updates from an RSS feed to a Mastodon instance. It checks for new entries in the RSS feed every 10 minutes, processes the entries to ensure they haven't been posted before, and posts the title and link of each new entry to Mastodon. The workflow ensures no duplicates by storing the last processed entry ID.

### Demonstrate
A content creator could use this workflow to automatically share new blog posts to their Mastodon followers, ensuring timely updates without manual posting, thus saving time and maintaining audience engagement.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your RSS feed URL in the RSS Feed Read node.
3. Enter your Mastodon instance URL and access token in the HTTP Request node.
4. Activate the workflow.
5. Test by adding a new entry to your RSS feed and checking Mastodon for the post.

### Practice
Create a test RSS feed with a few entries. Run the workflow and observe how it posts to Mastodon. Modify the RSS feed by adding a new entry and verify the workflow processes it correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated social media posting services. This can enhance client engagement, reduce manual workload, and expand your service offerings, potentially increasing your income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
