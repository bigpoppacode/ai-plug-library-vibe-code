# HTTP Stickynote Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Chat Message Trigger**.
  2. **Chat Message Trigger** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **LLM Response Provider (OpenRouter)** `lmChatOpenRouter` — model: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`
4. **LLM Memory Buffer (Input Context)** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "my_test_session", sessionIdType: "customKey", contextWindowLength: "20"
5. **LLM Memory Buffer (Report Context)** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "my_test_session", sessionIdType: "customKey", contextWindowLength: "20"
6. **Fetch Wikipedia Information** `toolWikipedia` — configured for its default action.
7. **Sticky Note: SerpAPI Setup** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "420", height: "140"
8. **Sticky Note: Jina AI Setup** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "420", height: "140"
9. **Sticky Note: OpenRouter API Setup** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "300", height: "180"
10. **Generate Search Queries using LLM** `chainLlm` — text: "=User Query: {{ $('Chat Message Trigger').item.json.chatInput }}", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
11. **Parse and Chunk JSON Data** `code` — jsCode: "// Parse the input JSON string and split it into four chunks
const rawText = $json.text;

// Remove Markdown JSON code blocks if present
const cleanedText = rawText.replace(/```jso…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates research by processing user queries through AI and various tools. It triggers on a chat message, generates search queries using a language model, fetches data from the web, and analyzes the information to produce a comprehensive research report.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to streamline client research, quickly generating comprehensive reports from varied sources. This saves time and ensures accuracy, making it a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making in business strategies.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up API keys for OpenRouter, SerpAPI, and Jina AI.
3. Customize the chat trigger to your input method.
4. Adjust the report generation to match your needs.
5. Test with sample queries to ensure desired outputs.

### Practice
Create a simple query in your chat trigger, like "latest AI trends." Run the workflow to see how it generates search queries, fetches data, and compiles a report. Modify the query to test different scenarios and observe the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient research services, providing clients with insightful, data-backed reports. This can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and boost revenue in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openRouterApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
