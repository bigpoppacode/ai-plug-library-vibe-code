# HTTP Schedule Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the handling of GitLab merge requests. It checks GitLab for existing open merge requests from a specified source branch. If no open requests exist, it creates a new merge request. If open requests are found, it closes them. After creating a new request, it adds custom notes, waits for a pipeline to finish, and merges the request when successful.

**Demonstrate**  
A development team could use this workflow to automate the management of merge requests, ensuring that code changes from a particular branch are efficiently reviewed, integrated, and closed. This helps maintain clean and organized repositories.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitLab account.
3. Customize the source and target branch names and merge request titles.
4. Set up a schedule for how often the workflow should run.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it performs the desired actions on GitLab.

**Practice**  
Create a test repository in GitLab and try running the workflow with a test branch. Observe how the workflow handles merge requests, closes existing ones, and creates new ones. Modify the branch names to see how the workflow responds.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can streamline your development process, making your team more efficient. It can also enhance your service offerings, attracting clients who need automated DevOps solutions, thus increasing your business's value and revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
