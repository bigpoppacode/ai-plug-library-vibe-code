# HTTP Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **AI Agent** `agent` — agent: "conversationalAgent", options: "[object Object]"
4. **DeepSeek** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `=deepseek-reasoner`
5. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "420", height: "340"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "580", height: "400"
8. **Ollama DeepSeek** `lmChatOllama` — model: `deepseek-r1:14b`
9. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "600", height: "460"
10. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "420", height: "340"
11. **DeepSeek JSON Body** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`
12. **DeepSeek Raw Body** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`
13. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "580", height: "840"
14. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "580", height: "400"
15. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "300", height: "120"
16. **Basic LLM Chain2** `chainLlm` — messages: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the handling of chat messages using AI. When a chat message is received, it triggers an AI agent to process the message. The workflow utilizes the DeepSeek model for reasoning, stores the conversation context using a memory buffer, and sends the message to DeepSeek's API for further processing. This setup ensures that chat interactions are efficiently managed and enhanced by AI reasoning capabilities.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business might use this workflow for customer service, where incoming chat messages are automatically processed to provide immediate and intelligent responses, improving customer satisfaction and reducing response times.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your DeepSeek API credentials.  
3. Set up a chat trigger to start the process.  
4. Customize the AI agent's behavior as needed.  
5. Test the workflow with sample chat messages.

**Practice:**  
Create a simple chat interface and connect it to this workflow. Test it by sending various messages and observe how the AI agent responds. Adjust the AI's settings to improve response accuracy.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by integrating intelligent chat solutions. It can help you attract clients looking for advanced customer service automation, boosting your business's value and income potential in the AI automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, ollamaApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
