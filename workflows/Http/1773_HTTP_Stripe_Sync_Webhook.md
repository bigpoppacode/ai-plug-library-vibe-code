# HTTP Stripe Sync Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stripeTrigger, httpRequest, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Stripe Trigger on Payment Event**.
  2. **Stripe Trigger on Payment Event** `stripeTrigger` — events: "checkout.session.completed"
3. **Extract Session Information** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions/{{ $json.data.object.id }}`
4. **Filter Information** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow automates the process of handling Stripe payment events. When a payment session is completed, it triggers the workflow to retrieve detailed session information, including customer details and items purchased, from Stripe. This information is then filtered and structured to be used in other applications or services.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update their CRM with customer purchase details every time a transaction is completed on their website. This ensures that customer data is always up-to-date and reduces manual data entry.

- **Imitate**: To apply this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your Stripe account, and configure the nodes to match your data structure. Adjust the filter node to extract the specific data you need, such as customer name, email, and purchased product details.

- **Practice**: Create a test Stripe transaction and run the workflow to see how it captures and processes the payment data. Modify the filter node to extract additional details, like purchase amount or payment method, and observe the changes.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow helps streamline your business operations by automating customer data updates. This can enhance customer relationship management, improve marketing efforts, and increase efficiency, ultimately leading to better customer service and increased sales.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** stripeApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
