  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the creation of SEO-optimized blog articles. It starts with a research query submission, uses Perplexity API for gathering information, and GPT-4 for content generation. The article is then published on WordPress, with notifications sent via Gmail and Slack, and logged in Notion.

**Demonstrate:** A content marketing agency could use this workflow to automate the creation and publication of articles, saving time and ensuring consistency. It's ideal for maintaining a steady flow of content without manual intervention.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your accounts for WordPress, Gmail, Slack, and Notion.
3. Customize the form trigger with your research topics.
4. Test the workflow with a sample query to ensure proper execution.
5. Adjust notifications and logging settings as needed.

**Practice:** Create a sample research question and run the workflow. Check if the article is correctly published on WordPress and if notifications are sent. Adjust the workflow to include more personalized elements or additional steps as needed.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated content creation services, enhancing efficiency and scalability for clients. This can boost your service portfolio, attract new customers, and generate additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, mcpClientApi, wordpressApi, gmailOAuth2, openAiApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
