# HTTP Schedule Send Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, noOp×2, scheduleTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Get Elastic Alert** `httpRequest` — url: `https://your-prism-elastic-api-endpoint.com/alerts`
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Response is not empty** `if` — options: "[object Object]"
5. **No Operation, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to check for alerts from an Elastic API endpoint and send email notifications if any alerts are found. It starts with a scheduled trigger that periodically checks the API for alerts. If alerts are detected, the workflow loops through each alert and sends a detailed email notification. If no alerts are found, the workflow executes a "No Operation" step, effectively doing nothing.

### Demonstrate
A cybersecurity firm could use this workflow to monitor for security alerts. When an alert is triggered, the workflow ensures that IT staff are immediately notified via email, allowing them to respond quickly to potential threats.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Elastic and email accounts.
3. Set up the schedule trigger with your desired interval.
4. Customize the email node with your recipient's address.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends notifications appropriately.

### Practice
Create a test environment by simulating alerts in your Elastic API. Run the workflow and observe how it handles both the presence and absence of alerts, verifying the email notifications and the "No Operation" step.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time alerting services to clients, enhancing their operational security and responsiveness. This can increase your service value, attract more customers, and potentially generate additional income streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
