# HTTP Stickynote Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute "Generate a chart" tool**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **Execute "Generate a chart" tool** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]"
5. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $('When chat message received').item.json.sessionId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "681", height: "945"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "769", height: "523"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "888", height: "646"
9. **OpenAI Chat Model Classifier** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
10. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "948", height: "646"
11. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "680", height: "720"
12. **OpenAI - Generate Chart definition with Structured Output** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
13. **Information Extractor - User question** `informationExtractor` — text: "={{ $json.chatInput }}", options: "[object Object]", attributes: "[object Object]"
14. **Set response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.output.user_question }}", agent: "sqlAgent", options: "[object Object]"
16. **Text Classifier - Chart required?** `textClassifier` — options: "[object Object]", inputText: "=**User Request**: {{ $('When chat message received').item.json.chatInput }}
**Data to visualize**: {{ $json.output }}
", categories: "[object Object]"
17. **User question + Agent initial response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
18. **Set Text output** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
19. **Execute Workflow** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]"
20. **Set Text + Chart output** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow is designed to handle user queries and generate visual data representations. It uses an AI agent to interpret questions, extracts relevant data from a database, and determines if a chart is needed. If so, it generates a chart definition using OpenAI, which is then transformed into a visual chart via Quickchart.io, providing both textual and graphical responses.

- **Demonstrate:** A data analyst at a business could use this workflow to automate the generation of sales reports. By inputting queries about sales data, the system automatically provides both the data and a visual chart, improving reporting efficiency and decision-making.

- **Imitate:** To apply this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your database, and configure the OpenAI credentials. Adjust the SQL queries in the AI agent to fit your data source. Test by sending a few sample queries to ensure the workflow correctly generates charts and responses.

- **Practice:** Create a simple database with sales data. Use the workflow to query sales figures for a specific period and observe the generated chart. Modify the query parameters to see how different inputs affect the output.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can enable you to offer automated data analysis and visualization services, which are highly sought after in data-driven businesses. This skill can help you attract new clients, enhance your service offerings, and potentially increase your income by providing advanced analytics solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
