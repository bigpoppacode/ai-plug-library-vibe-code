  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "440", content: "## Line AI Chatbot with Groq 
This workflow automates the process of handling messages from Line Messaging API by sending message to Groq as your AI assistant and reply back to you…[truncated]"
3. **Line: Messaging API** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/befed026-573c-4d3a-9113-046ea8ae5930`
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "260", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — content: "## Get Message
Get message from Line account."
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — content: "[redacted]"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — content: "[redacted]"
8. **Get Messages** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Groq AI Assistant** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
10. **Line: Reply Message** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates the handling of messages from the Line Messaging API. When a message is received, it extracts the message text and sends it to the Groq AI Assistant for processing. The AI's response is then sent back to the user on Line, enabling seamless communication through an AI chatbot.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business could use this workflow to automate customer support on Line, providing instant AI-generated responses to common queries, reducing the need for human intervention and improving response times.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Line and Groq accounts.  
3. Set up a webhook trigger for Line messages.  
4. Customize the AI response logic in the Groq node.  
5. Test with sample messages to ensure correct replies.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Line account and send messages to it. Observe how the workflow processes these messages and responds using the AI assistant. Experiment with different message types to see how the AI adapts its responses.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation portfolio, offering clients AI-driven chat solutions that improve customer engagement. This can increase your service offerings, attract more clients, and boost your income in the AI automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
