# HTTP Schedule Update Webhook
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote√ó5, scheduleTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` ‚Äî rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", width: "940", height: "620"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "340", height: "240", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` ‚Äî height: "180", content: "**Binance**
   - No Binance API key required (uses public endpoint)
   - Ensure internet access to call Binance API"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` ‚Äî height: "180", content: "
### ‚è± Schedule
- Runs **every hour**
- Cron expression: `5 * * * *`  
  _(At minute 5 of every hour)_"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "560", content: "
3. **Optional: Add More Coins**
   - In the **Function node**, find the line:
     ```js
     const relevantSymbols = ['SOLUSDC', 'BTCUSDC', 'ETHUSDC'];
     ```
   - Add your pre‚Ä¶[truncated]"
8. **Binance 24h Price Change** `httpRequest` ‚Äî url: `https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr`
9. **Analyze & Format Market Data** `function` ‚Äî functionCode: "function escapeHTML(text) {
  return String(text)
    .replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
    .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
    .replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
}

function formatVolume(volume) {
  const vol ‚Ä¶[truncated]"
10. **Send Telegram Message** `telegram` ‚Äî text: "={{ $json.data }}

", chatId: "-4685771678", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching cryptocurrency market data from Binance every hour. It retrieves 24-hour price change data for specific cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL), analyzes and formats this data, then sends a summarized report via Telegram. The report includes metrics like price change percentage, volatility, bid-ask spread, and more, providing a comprehensive market overview.

### Demonstrate
A cryptocurrency trader could use this workflow to receive timely updates on market trends without manually checking prices. This helps in making informed trading decisions and staying updated on market movements.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Telegram bot via @BotFather and get the bot token.
3. Configure the Telegram node with your bot token and chat ID.
4. Adjust the function node to include any additional cryptocurrencies.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends the desired updates.

### Practice
Create a mock Telegram group and add your bot. Run the workflow with test data to ensure it updates the group with market summaries. Try adding a new cryptocurrency pair to see how the workflow handles it.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time market monitoring services to crypto traders. This adds value to your automation offerings, potentially attracting more clients and increasing your income in the growing crypto and automation market.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
