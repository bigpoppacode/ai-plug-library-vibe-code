# HTTP Stickynote Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note1**.
  2. **Azure OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatAzureOpenAi` — model: `4o`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "320", height: "260"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "340", height: "560"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "340", height: "560"
6. **Line Chatbot** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/AIChatbot`
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "320", height: "600"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "320", height: "320"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "320", height: "620"
10. **Loading Animation** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/chat/loading/start`
11. **Check Message Type IsText?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $('Line Chatbot').item.json.body.events[0].message.text }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
13. **ReplyMessage - Not supported** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
14. **Format Reply** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **ReplyMessage - Line** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates a chatbot using LINE messaging and Azure OpenAI services. It listens for messages sent to a LINE chatbot, checks if the message is text, and processes it using a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) AI model. If the message is text, it gets a response from the AI model and sends a reply via LINE. If the message is not text, it informs the user that only text messages are supported.

**Demonstrate:**  
A mental health app could use this workflow to provide 24/7 CBT-based chatbot support, offering users immediate guidance and support for mental health challenges.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a LINE chatbot and configure the webhook URL.
3. Connect Azure OpenAI API credentials.
4. Test by sending text messages to the chatbot and observing AI-generated responses.

**Practice:**  
Create a LINE chatbot and test the workflow by sending various text messages. Observe how the AI model responds. Experiment with non-text messages to see how the workflow handles unsupported formats.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated mental health support services, expanding your service offerings. This can attract clients looking for scalable, AI-driven solutions in healthcare, increasing your market reach and revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, azureOpenAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
