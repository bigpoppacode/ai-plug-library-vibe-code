# HTTP ExecuteWorkflow Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "616", height: "236", content: "### Convert the query string into JSON, apply the limit for a page length"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "491", height: "285.7", content: "## Send an error message:
1. If query param was incorrect, return the instruction. AI Agent should pick up on this and adapt the query on the next iteration.
2. If the query is OK …[truncated]"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1200", height: "493", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "617", height: "503", content: "## Example ReAct AI Agent
1. Agent Prompt is default
2. Check the description of the HTTP_Request_Tool, it guides the agent to provide a query string with several parameters instea…[truncated]"
6. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
7. **OpenAI Chat Model1** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
8. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
9. **HTTP_Request_Tool** `toolWorkflow` — name: "HTTP_Request_Tool", workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "Call this tool to fetch a webpage content. The input should be a stringified HTTP query parameter like this: "?url=VALIDURL&method=SELECTEDMETHOD". "url" parameter should contain t…[truncated]"
10. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
11. **QUERY_PARAMS** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **CONFIG** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ encodeURI($json.query.url) }}`
14. **Is error?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
15. **Stringify error message** `set` — include: "selected", options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
16. **Exctract HTML Body** `set` — include: "selected", options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **Remove extra tags** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
18. **Simplify?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
19. **Simplify output** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
20. **Convert to Markdown** `markdown` — html: "={{ $json.HTML }}", options: "[object Object]", destinationKey: "page_content"
21. **Send Page Content** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves webpage content based on a query, processes it by extracting and cleaning the HTML body, converts it to Markdown, and ensures the content length is within limits. If errors occur, it sends back error messages. This process facilitates handling and formatting web content efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A web scraping service could use this workflow to fetch and process webpage data, converting it into a more readable format for clients. This is useful for content aggregation platforms that need structured data from various web sources.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the HTTP request URL to target specific web pages.
3. Set up error handling and content length limits in the CONFIG node.
4. Adjust the Markdown conversion settings to suit your output needs.
5. Test the workflow with different URLs to ensure it processes content correctly.

### Practice
Create a workflow with a test URL that fetches a webpage, processes the content, and outputs it in Markdown format. Experiment by changing the URL and observing how the workflow handles different content structures.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer web content processing services, transforming raw HTML into structured Markdown. This skill can attract clients needing content aggregation, enhancing your service portfolio and potentially increasing revenue in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
