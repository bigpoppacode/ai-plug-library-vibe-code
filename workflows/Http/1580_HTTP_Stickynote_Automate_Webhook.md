# HTTP Stickynote Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Chat Message Trigger**.
  2. **Chat Message Trigger** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **LLM Response Provider (OpenRouter)** `lmChatOpenRouter` — model: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`
4. **LLM Memory Buffer (Input Context)** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "my_test_session", sessionIdType: "customKey", contextWindowLength: "20"
5. **LLM Memory Buffer (Report Context)** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "my_test_session", sessionIdType: "customKey", contextWindowLength: "20"
6. **Fetch Wikipedia Information** `toolWikipedia` — configured for its default action.
7. **Sticky Note: SerpAPI Setup** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "420", height: "140"
8. **Sticky Note: Jina AI Setup** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "420", height: "140"
9. **Sticky Note: OpenRouter API Setup** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "300", height: "180"
10. **Generate Search Queries using LLM** `chainLlm` — text: "=User Query: {{ $('Chat Message Trigger').item.json.chatInput }}", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
11. **Parse and Chunk JSON Data** `code` — jsCode: "// Parse the input JSON string and split it into four chunks
const rawText = $json.text;

// Remove Markdown JSON code blocks if present
const cleanedText = rawText.replace(/```jso…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This workflow automates the process of deep research using AI. It starts with a chat message that triggers the generation of search queries. These queries are processed to fetch information from sources like SerpAPI and Wikipedia. The data is then analyzed and relevant contexts are extracted using AI, specifically the LLM model. Finally, a comprehensive research report is generated based on the gathered information.

**Demonstrate:** A consultant could use this workflow to automate the process of gathering and analyzing competitive intelligence, saving time and improving the accuracy of reports.

**Imitate:** To apply this workflow, set up your n8n environment, import the workflow, connect the necessary APIs (SerpAPI, Jina AI, OpenRouter), and configure triggers and nodes according to your research needs. Test the workflow to ensure it runs smoothly.

**Practice:** Create a test workflow that responds to a chat message by fetching data from Wikipedia and generating a brief summary. This will help you understand the data flow and AI integration.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated research services to clients, saving them time and providing them with detailed insights. This can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openRouterApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
