# HTTP Telegram Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using cron, httpRequest, telegram.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Telegram**.
  2. **Telegram** `telegram` — text: "=Hey Daniel, here's your daily affirmation...

{{$node["HTTP Request"].json["affirmation"]}}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending daily affirmations via Telegram. At 9 AM daily, it triggers an HTTP request to fetch an affirmation from an external API. The affirmation is then sent as a message to a specified Telegram user, providing a positive start to their day.

### Demonstrate
A life coach could use this workflow to automatically send daily motivational quotes or affirmations to their clients, enhancing customer engagement and providing consistent value with minimal effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Connect your Telegram account with a valid API token.
3. Set the desired time in the Cron node for when you want the message sent.
4. Test the workflow to ensure the affirmation is correctly retrieved and sent.

### Practice
Create a test Telegram bot and set up the workflow to send affirmations to your own account. Adjust the message format or content source to experiment with different types of messages.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer personalized daily messaging services to clients, enhancing engagement and customer relationships. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and potential upsell opportunities in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
