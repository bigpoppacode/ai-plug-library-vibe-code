# HTTP Schedule Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, scheduleTrigger, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "## Test Data 

Using n8n.io as test url.

For production use, you have to connect your data here."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "389", height: "255.7976193268613", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Test Data** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **Scrape website with Scrappey** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://publisher.scrappey.com/api/v1`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of web scraping using Scrappey. It starts with a schedule trigger to run at specified intervals. It sets up test data, including a URL to scrape, then uses Scrappey’s API to perform the web scraping task. The workflow is designed to fetch data from the specified website URL and can be customized for production by connecting it to the relevant data sources.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to regularly collect data from competitor websites for market analysis, ensuring they have up-to-date information without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your Scrappey API key.
3. Adjust the schedule trigger to your desired frequency.
4. Update the test data URL to the target website you wish to scrape.
5. Run the workflow and review the output.

### Practice
Create a sample workflow to scrape a public website like a news site. Use the workflow to extract headlines at regular intervals, then review how the fetched data changes over time.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer web scraping services to clients, automating data collection for competitive analysis, lead generation, or market research. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
