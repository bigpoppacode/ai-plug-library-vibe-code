# HTTP Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **AI Agent** `agent` — agent: "conversationalAgent", options: "[object Object]"
4. **DeepSeek** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `=deepseek-reasoner`
5. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "420", height: "340"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "580", height: "400"
8. **Ollama DeepSeek** `lmChatOllama` — model: `deepseek-r1:14b`
9. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "600", height: "460"
10. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "420", height: "340"
11. **DeepSeek JSON Body** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`
12. **DeepSeek Raw Body** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`
13. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "580", height: "840"
14. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "580", height: "400"
15. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "300", height: "120"
16. **Basic LLM Chain2** `chainLlm` — messages: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to handle chat messages, process them using an AI agent, and interact with the DeepSeek API for reasoning. When a chat message is received, it triggers the AI agent to process the message, utilizing the DeepSeek reasoning model for generating responses. The workflow incorporates memory to maintain conversation context and uses HTTP requests to interact with external APIs for advanced processing.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer service chat interactions, providing instant, intelligent responses to customer inquiries, thus reducing the need for human intervention and improving response times.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Set up the chat trigger to receive messages from your platform.
  3. Connect and configure the AI agent with your desired settings.
  4. Ensure DeepSeek credentials are set up for API interaction.
  5. Test the workflow with sample chat messages to verify performance.

- **Practice:** Create a test environment where you simulate customer chat messages. Use different scenarios to see how the AI agent and DeepSeek API handle varying inquiries. Adjust settings for improved accuracy and response quality.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated chat solutions to clients, enhancing their customer service operations and creating potential revenue streams from AI-driven customer engagement services. This skillset positions you as a valuable asset in the AI automation space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, ollamaApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
