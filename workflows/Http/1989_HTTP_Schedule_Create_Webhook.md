# HTTP Schedule Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×2, scheduleTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **searchQuery** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
4. **set API key** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Perplexity** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions`
6. **Post to X** `twitter` — text: "={{ $json.choices[0].message.content }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically retrieves the latest AI news and posts it to Twitter. It starts with a scheduled trigger every 21 hours, sets a search query for AI news, uses Perplexity AI to generate a concise news summary, and posts this summary to Twitter. The workflow ensures consistent, timely updates on AI developments on social media.

### Demonstrate
A tech blogger could use this workflow to keep their Twitter followers updated with the latest AI news, helping to establish themselves as a thought leader in the AI space without manually searching and posting.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Perplexity API and Twitter credentials.
3. Customize the news query if needed.
4. Activate the workflow to automatically post updates every 21 hours.
5. Test with different search queries to refine the content quality.

### Practice
Create a test Twitter account and run the workflow with different AI-related search queries. Observe the variations in the news summaries generated and posted. Adjust the workflow parameters to optimize the quality and relevance of the content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content curation and posting, enhancing your social media presence with minimal effort. It can attract followers, establish authority in your niche, and potentially draw clients interested in similar automation solutions, expanding your business opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** twitterOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
