# HTTP Medium Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using medium, webhook, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTTP Request**.
  2. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `https://dev.to/api/articles`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates content publishing by receiving article data via a webhook, then posting it to both Medium and Dev.to. It starts with a webhook that triggers when new content is submitted. The workflow sends this content to Dev.to using an HTTP request and simultaneously publishes it on Medium, ensuring content is distributed across multiple platforms efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A content creator or marketing agency could use this workflow to streamline publishing articles across multiple platforms, saving time and ensuring consistent messaging. By automating this process, they maintain a strong online presence without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Medium and Dev.to accounts.
3. Set up a webhook trigger to receive article data.
4. Customize the JSON fields to match your content structure.
5. Test the workflow to ensure articles are published correctly.

### Practice
Create a test webhook and submit a sample article with a title, content, and tags. Run the workflow to see how it posts to Medium and Dev.to. Adjust the content and tags to see how the workflow handles different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated content distribution services, enhancing your value to clients and expanding your service offerings. This can lead to increased efficiency, client satisfaction, and potential revenue growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mediumApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
