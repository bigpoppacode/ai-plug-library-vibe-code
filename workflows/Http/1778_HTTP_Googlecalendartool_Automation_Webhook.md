# HTTP Googlecalendartool Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Window Buffer Memory**.
  2. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $json.body.events[0].source.userId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **Wikipedia** `toolWikipedia` — configured for its default action.
5. **Line Receiving** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/linechatbotagent`
6. **Google Calendar Create** `googleCalendarTool` — end: "=  {{ $fromAI("createenddate","end date and time to create event") }}", start: "=  {{ $fromAI("createstartdate","start date and time to create event") }}", calendar: "[object Object]"
7. **Google Calendar Read** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **getAll**
8. **Gmail Read** `gmailTool` — operation: **getAll**
9. **Switch Between Text and Others** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
10. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.body.events[0].message.text }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
11. **OpenAI** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
12. **Error Handling from AI Response** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
13. **Text Cleansing** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Line Answering (Error Case)** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
15. **Line Answering (Ordinary Case)** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow acts as a chatbot assistant integrated with LINE, Google Calendar, and Gmail. It processes incoming messages from LINE users, using AI to interpret and respond to inquiries. It can create and read Google Calendar events, read Gmail messages, and provide information from Wikipedia. The workflow includes error handling to manage unexpected inputs or failures, ensuring smooth interaction and response.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer service on LINE, handling scheduling requests or FAQs, freeing up human resources for more complex tasks.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect LINE, Google Calendar, and Gmail accounts.
3. Set up the LINE webhook for message handling.
4. Customize AI prompts to match your business needs.
5. Test with sample messages to ensure correct responses.

**Practice:**  
Create a test LINE account and send different types of messages to see how the workflow responds. Adjust AI prompts and error handling to refine interactions.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow lets you offer AI-driven customer service solutions, enhancing client engagement and efficiency. This skill can attract businesses seeking to automate support, expanding your service offerings and income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
