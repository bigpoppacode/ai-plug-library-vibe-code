# HTTP Emailreadimap Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Read emails (IMAP)** `emailReadImap` — options: "[object Object]", postProcessAction: "nothing"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "361", height: "90", content: "## Summarize emails with A.I.
You can find out more about the [use case](https://rumjahn.com/how-a-i-saved-my-kids-school-life-and-my-marriage/)"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "229", height: "280"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "365", height: "442"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "307", height: "439"
7. **Send email to A.I. to summarize** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
8. **Send summarized content to messenger** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**: This workflow automates the process of summarizing emails using artificial intelligence. It reads emails from an inbox, sends them to an AI service to generate concise summaries, and then forwards these summaries to a messaging platform, ensuring quick and efficient communication of important information.

**Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to keep track of important emails without having to read each one in detail. By receiving summaries on a messaging app, they can quickly grasp the essence of their emails on the go.

**Imitate**: 1. Connect your IMAP email account and LINE messaging account to n8n. 2. Import the workflow. 3. Set up the necessary API credentials for the AI and messaging services. 4. Test the workflow with your email data to ensure summaries are sent correctly.

**Practice**: Create a test email account and send various emails to it. Run the workflow to see how different types of emails are summarized and sent to your messaging app. Adjust the AI prompt to refine the summaries.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a unique service of email summarization and quick communication to clients, enhancing their productivity and decision-making. This can be a valuable addition to your automation business, attracting more clients and increasing revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
