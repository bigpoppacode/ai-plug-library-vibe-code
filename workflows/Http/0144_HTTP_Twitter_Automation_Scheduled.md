# HTTP Twitter Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, cron, twitter.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Tweet image jokes**.
  2. **Tweet image jokes** `twitter` — text: "={{$node["Request blablagues"].json["data"]["data"]["content"]["text"]}}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically posts a joke image on Twitter every day at 5 PM. It fetches a random joke image from the Blablagues API, downloads the image, and then tweets it with the joke text. This ensures consistent, engaging content on your Twitter feed with minimal effort.

### Demonstrate
A social media manager for a brand could use this workflow to keep their Twitter account active and engaging by automatically posting humorous content daily, increasing engagement and follower interaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Twitter account credentials.
3. Set the cron node for your preferred posting time.
4. Test the workflow with a manual trigger to ensure it tweets as expected.
5. Activate the workflow to start posting daily.

### Practice
Create a test Twitter account and run the workflow to see how it posts. Experiment with different posting times and joke categories from the Blablagues API to see how content variation affects engagement.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated social media management services, freeing clients from daily content posting. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** twitterOAuth1Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
