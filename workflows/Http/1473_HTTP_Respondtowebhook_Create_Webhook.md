# HTTP Respondtowebhook Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using respondToWebhook×2, if, webhook.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/generate-voice`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "806.0818150700699", height: "495.17470523089514", content: "[redacted]"
4. **If params correct** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
5. **Generate voice** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{{ $json.body.voice_id }}`
6. **Error** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "json", responseBody: "{
 "error": "Invalid inputs."
}"
7. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "binary"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to convert text into speech using the Elevenlabs API. It begins by receiving a POST request at a specific webhook endpoint. The workflow checks if the request contains the necessary parameters: `voice_id` and `text`. If the parameters are present, it sends a request to the Elevenlabs text-to-speech API to generate the voice output. If the parameters are incorrect or missing, it returns an error message. Once the voice is generated, the workflow responds with the audio file.

### Demonstrate
A content creator could use this workflow to automate the process of generating voiceovers for videos. By simply sending a text and voice ID, they can quickly receive a voiceover file, saving time and maintaining consistency across projects.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Elevenlabs API credentials in n8n.
3. Configure the webhook to receive POST requests with `voice_id` and `text`.
4. Test the workflow by sending a request with valid parameters.
5. Customize the workflow to handle different voice IDs or text inputs as needed.

### Practice
Create a test webhook and send a POST request with sample text and a voice ID. Observe how the workflow processes the request and generates the voice output. Experiment by changing the text or voice ID to see different results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated voiceover services, which can enhance content production efficiency. This skill can attract content creators or businesses looking to streamline their media production, providing an opportunity to expand your service offerings and generate additional income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpCustomAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
