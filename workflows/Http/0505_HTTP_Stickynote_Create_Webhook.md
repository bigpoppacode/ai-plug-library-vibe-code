  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates lead management from form submissions. It verifies email addresses using CaptainVerify, checks available credits, and manages leads in SuiteCRM. If the email is valid, it creates a lead in SuiteCRM and a contact in Brevo, linking them with a unique ID. Notifications are sent via NextCloud for credit status and lead creation.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automate managing new customer leads from online forms, ensuring email validity, and integrating them into their CRM and marketing platforms, saving time and reducing manual errors.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow in n8n.
2. Connect Tally Forms, CaptainVerify, SuiteCRM, and Brevo.
3. Set up a form to collect leads.
4. Test the email verification and lead creation process.
5. Adjust notifications for your NextCloud discussion setup.

**Practice:**  
Create a test form and submit a few entries. Observe how the workflow processes each form, verifies emails, creates CRM leads, and sends notifications. Experiment with different email addresses to see how it handles invalid entries.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated lead management services to businesses, enhancing your offerings as an AI automation consultant. This can lead to new clients, increased revenue, and the ability to provide scalable solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
