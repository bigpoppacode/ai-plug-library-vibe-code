# HTTP Emailreadimap Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Read emails (IMAP)** `emailReadImap` — options: "[object Object]", postProcessAction: "nothing"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "361", height: "90", content: "## Summarize emails with A.I.
You can find out more about the [use case](https://rumjahn.com/how-a-i-saved-my-kids-school-life-and-my-marriage/)"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "229", height: "280"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "365", height: "442"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "307", height: "439"
7. **Send email to A.I. to summarize** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
8. **Send summarized content to messenger** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates email management by reading emails from an IMAP server, sending their content to an AI service for summarization, and then pushing the summarized content to a messaging service. This process helps users quickly understand their emails without manually reading each one.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently manage their inbox, allowing them to focus on critical tasks by quickly reviewing AI-generated summaries of their emails sent to a messaging app like LINE.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up an IMAP email account in n8n.
2. Connect to Openrouter.ai for AI summarization.
3. Configure the HTTP request to send summaries to LINE Messenger.
4. Test the workflow with a few emails to ensure it summarizes and sends correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a dummy email account and send emails to it. Run the workflow and observe how summaries are generated and sent to LINE. Adjust the summarization criteria and see the effects on the output.

**WIIFM:**  
This workflow can help you provide email management services to clients, enhancing productivity and saving time. Mastering such workflows can expand your business offerings, attract more clients, and increase revenue by automating repetitive tasks.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
