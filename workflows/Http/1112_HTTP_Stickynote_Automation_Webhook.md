# HTTP Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute "Generate a chart" tool**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`
3. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
4. **Generate a chart** `toolWorkflow` — name: "generate_a_chart", schemaType: "manual", workflowId: "={{ $workflow.id }}"
5. **Execute "Generate a chart" tool** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "680.7609104727082", height: "619.3187860363884"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "768.8586342909368", height: "503"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "768", height: "485.8165429718969"
9. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
10. **OpenAI - Generate Chart definition with Structured Output** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
11. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
12. **Set response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow integrates an AI Agent that can generate charts based on user queries. When a user sends a message that requires a chart, the AI Agent processes the request, uses OpenAI to generate a Chart.js definition, and returns a URL to a chart image via Quickchart.io. This enables dynamic chart creation within conversations.

- **Demonstrate:** A business analyst could use this workflow to quickly generate visual data representations during meetings, enhancing data-driven discussions and decision-making processes.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Connect your OpenAI account.
  3. Set up a trigger for receiving chat messages.
  4. Customize the AI Agent's prompts for specific chart types.
  5. Test by sending sample queries to generate different charts.

- **Practice:** Create a sample dataset and request different chart types (bar, line, pie) through the AI Agent. Observe how the workflow adapts the chart generation based on your input and modify parameters to fit your needs.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer dynamic data visualization services, enhancing client presentations and reports. This capability can increase your value proposition, attract clients, and open new revenue streams in the automation and AI service industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
