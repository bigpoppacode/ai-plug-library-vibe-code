# HTTP AWSRekognition Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Set3**.
  2. **Set3** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of searching for street images using Google's Custom Search API, analyzing them with AWS Rekognition to identify labels, and then storing the results in a Google Sheets document. It starts by making an HTTP request to fetch images, processes the images to detect labels, and finally logs the image title, link, and detected labels into a Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A travel blogger could use this workflow to automatically gather and label street images for their blog, saving time on manual searches and ensuring they have relevant, well-labeled content for their posts.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google API and AWS Rekognition credentials.
3. Set up a Google Sheet with columns for image name, link, and labels.
4. Run the workflow to see how it fetches images and logs data.
5. Adjust the search query or Google Sheet ID as needed.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to search for images of your favorite travel destination and identify the main elements in those images. Check how the labels correspond to your expectations and refine your search criteria accordingly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated content curation services, such as image sourcing and labeling, to clients in media, marketing, or blogging. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and generate additional income streams in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** aws, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
