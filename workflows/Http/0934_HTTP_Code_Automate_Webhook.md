# HTTP Code Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, googleDriveTrigger, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Drive Trigger**.
  2. **Google Drive Trigger** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1340", height: "280", content: "## Automated PDF to HTML Conversion
"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "1340", height: "180", content: "## Description: 
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting a newly stored PDF file from Google Drive into an HTML file and saving it back to Google Drive. The workflow …[truncated]"
5. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
6. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.pdf.co/v1/pdf/convert/to/html`
7. **Convert to Binary File** `code` — jsCode: "// Convert the HTML string to a Buffer
const buffer = Buffer.from($json.body, 'utf-8');

// Return the buffer as binary data
return [
  {
    binary: {
      data: {
        data: …[truncated]"
8. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — name: "sample.html", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the conversion of newly uploaded PDF files in Google Drive into HTML files. When a PDF is added to a specific folder, the workflow triggers, checks if the file is indeed a PDF, and then uses an external API to convert the PDF to HTML. The resulting HTML file is then saved back to Google Drive, streamlining document transformation without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A web development agency could use this workflow to convert client-provided PDFs into HTML, facilitating easier content integration into websites. This saves time and ensures consistency in document handling.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Drive and PDF.co API accounts.
3. Set the Google Drive trigger to watch a specific folder.
4. Customize the folder ID and API credentials as needed.
5. Test by uploading a PDF to see if it converts and saves as HTML.

### Practice
Create a test folder in Google Drive, upload a few PDF files, and run the workflow. Check the folder for the HTML outputs. Experiment with different PDFs to see how well the conversion process works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated PDF-to-HTML conversion services, reducing manual workload for clients. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract more clients, and potentially increase your income in the automation and AI business sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
