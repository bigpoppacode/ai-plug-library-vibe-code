# HTTP Telegram Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×7, httpRequest×4, supabase×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Get New Message**.
  2. **Get New Message** `telegramTrigger` — updates: "message", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "600.723278204605", height: "213.15921994594194"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "282.075050779723", height: "80"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "235.09282368774151", height: "80"
6. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "3", height: "80", content: "Create table in [Supabase](https://supabase.com) with SQL query"
7. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280.2462120317618", height: "438.5821431288714"
8. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "636.2128494576581", height: "494.9629292914819"
9. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "330.5152611046425", height: "240.6839895136402"
10. **Find User** `supabase` — operation: **getAll**, table: `telegram_users`
11. **If User exists** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **OPENAI - Create thread** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/threads`
13. **Create User** `supabase` — table: `telegram_users`
14. **Merge** `merge` — configured for its default action.
15. **OPENAI - Send message** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{{ $('Merge').item.json.openai_thread_id }}/messages `
16. **OPENAI - Run assistant** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{{ $('Merge').item.json.openai_thread_id }}/runs`
17. **OPENAI - Get messages** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.openai.com/v1/threads/{{ $('Merge').item.json.openai_thread_id }}/messages`
18. **Send Message to User** `telegram` — text: "={{ $('OPENAI - Get messages').item.json.data[0].content[0].text.value }}", chatId: "={{ $('Get New Message').item.json.message.chat.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This workflow automates a chatbot interaction through Telegram and OpenAI. When a user sends a message to a Telegram bot, it checks if the user exists in a Supabase database. If the user doesn't exist, it creates a new user record and a thread for conversation. The workflow uses OpenAI to generate responses and sends them back to the user via Telegram, ensuring continuity in conversations by storing session data.

**Demonstrate:** A business can use this workflow to provide automated customer support via Telegram, answering user queries with AI-generated responses while maintaining conversational context using Supabase.

**Imitate:** 
1. Set up a Telegram bot using BotFather.
2. Create a Supabase table for user data.
3. Obtain OpenAI API credentials and create an assistant.
4. Import the workflow into n8n and configure the nodes with your credentials.
5. Test the workflow by sending a message to your Telegram bot.

**Practice:** Create a test Telegram bot and Supabase table. Run the workflow, send messages to the bot, and observe how the workflow logs user interactions and generates responses.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer AI-enhanced customer support solutions, improving user engagement and efficiency. This skill can attract businesses needing scalable support systems, thus increasing your service offerings and income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi, openAiApi, supabaseApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
