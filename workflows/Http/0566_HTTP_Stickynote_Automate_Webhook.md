8. **Return Tool Response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to enhance query resolution by integrating Confluence's knowledge base into an IT support process. It begins with a trigger that initiates a search in Confluence's API for relevant articles based on user queries. The workflow retrieves search results, including article titles, links, and summaries, and prepares them to be sent back to the parent workflow for further processing or user response, ensuring efficient and accurate information retrieval.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to improve their IT support by quickly accessing relevant knowledge base articles, reducing response time and improving the accuracy of information provided to users.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Confluence account with the correct API credentials.
3. Customize the query transformation logic to match your knowledge base structure.
4. Test the workflow by triggering a query and observing the results.

### Practice
Set up a test Confluence space with a few articles. Run the workflow with different queries to see how well it retrieves and formats the data for response. Adjust the query logic to improve search accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer enhanced IT support services, improving customer satisfaction and reducing support costs. This capability can attract new clients and provide upsell opportunities in your automation business, leading to increased revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
