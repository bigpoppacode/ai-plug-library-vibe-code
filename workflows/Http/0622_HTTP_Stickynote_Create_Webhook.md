# HTTP Stickynote Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works

3. **Sticky Note51** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "619.0692735087202", height: "320.9196076003899"
4. **Sticky Note52** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "773.6179704580734", height: "875.8289847608302"
5. **Sticky Note53** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "620.0617659833041", height: "218.46830740679286"
6. **Sticky Note54** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "409.8920345317687", height: "133.75846341937205"
7. **Set image description** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Generate Image** `openAi` — resource: **image**, prompt: "=Create a minimalist professional illustration of {{ $json.description }} with these specifications:

1. Visual Style:
- Modern tech-focused minimalist design
- Clean, uncluttered …[truncated]"
9. **Upload Img to ImgBB for URL** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload`
10. **ReSmush.it Image Optimisation** `httpRequest` — url: `=http://api.resmush.it/ws.php?img={{ $json.data.url }}`
11. **Store Optimised Image ImgBB** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload`
12. **No Operation, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow automates the process of generating and optimizing images for web use. It starts by setting an image description and generating an image using OpenAI's image generation capabilities. The generated image is then uploaded to ImgBB to generate a URL for hosting. Next, the image is optimized using ReSmush.it to reduce the file size. Finally, the optimized image is stored again on ImgBB, providing a URL for easy access and use online.

**Demonstrate**  
A graphic designer might use this workflow to quickly generate and optimize images for their website, ensuring the images are both visually appealing and efficiently formatted for web use, thus improving page load times and user experience.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up your OpenAI and ImgBB credentials.  
3. Customize the image description in the "Set image description" node.  
4. Activate the workflow and test by generating an image and verifying the URL and optimization.

**Practice**  
Create a simple test with a unique image description, run the workflow, and compare the original and optimized image sizes. Adjust the description and see how it impacts the generated image to understand the workflow's flexibility.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer image optimization services, helping clients improve their web performance and SEO. This can enhance your service offerings in an automation business, attracting more clients and increasing revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
