# HTTP Form Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Creation Form**.
  2. **Creation Form** `formTrigger` — path: `/1c6fe52c-48ab-4688-b5ae-7e24361aa602`
3. **On payment** `stripeTrigger` — events: "checkout.session.completed"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "275.01592825011585", height: "468.76027109756643"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "372", height: "200.14793114506386"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "519.9859025074911", height: "106.11515926602786"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "202.64787116404852", height: "85.79488430601403"
8. **Config** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **if is creation flow** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **Create Zoom meeting** `zoom` — channel/topic: `={{ $('Creation Form').item.json.title }}`
11. **Format participant** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Create Stripe Product** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.stripe.com/v1/products`
13. **Add participant to list** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
14. **Create payment link** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_links`
15. **Send confirmation to participant** `gmail` — sendTo: "={{ $('On payment').item.json.data.object.customer_details.email }}", message: "[redacted]", options: "[object Object]"
16. **Create participant list** `googleSheets` — operation: **create**
17. **Format event** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
18. **Notify teacher** `gmail` — sendTo: "={{ $('Config').item.json.teacher_email }}", message: "=<b>A new participant registred for the event {{ $('Retrieve event infos').item.json.title }} ({{ $('Retrieve event infos').item.json.start }})!</b><br/><br/>

<b>Name: {{ $('On pa…[truncated]", options: "[object Object]"
19. **Send email to teacher** `gmail` — sendTo: "={{ $('Config').item.json.teacher_email }}", message: "[redacted]", options: "[object Object]"
20. **Store event** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
21. **the end** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of setting up events with Zoom meetings and Stripe payments. It starts with a form submission to create an event, then generates a Zoom meeting and a Stripe product. It creates a payment link for the event and sends confirmation emails to participants and notifications to the organizer. Additionally, it logs event and participant details into Google Sheets for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate:**  
A consultant could use this workflow to streamline the setup of paid webinars, automating the creation of Zoom meetings, managing payments via Stripe, and keeping track of attendees in Google Sheets.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Zoom, Stripe, Gmail, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Customize the form fields and email contents as needed.
4. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it functions as expected.

**Practice:**  
Create a test event using the form and follow the flow to see how each step is executed. Adjust the configurations and email templates to fit your needs, and observe how the data is logged in Google Sheets.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer seamless event management solutions, enhancing your service offerings. By automating these processes, you can save time, reduce errors, and provide a professional service, potentially increasing your income through consulting or service fees.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** zoomOAuth2Api, stripeApi, gmailOAuth2, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
