# HTTP Googlecalendartool Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Window Buffer Memory**.
  2. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $json.body.events[0].source.userId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **Wikipedia** `toolWikipedia` — configured for its default action.
5. **Line Receiving** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/linechatbotagent`
6. **Google Calendar Create** `googleCalendarTool` — end: "= {{ $fromAI("createenddate","end date and time to create event") }}", start: "= {{ $fromAI("createstartdate","start date and time to create event") }}", calendar: "[object Object]"
7. **Google Calendar Read** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **getAll**
8. **Gmail Read** `gmailTool` — operation: **getAll**
9. **Switch Between Text and Others** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
10. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.body.events[0].message.text }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
11. **OpenAI** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
12. **Error Handling from AI Response** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
13. **Text Cleansing** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Line Answering (Error Case)** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
15. **Line Answering (Ordinary Case)** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow integrates LINE messaging with Google Calendar and Gmail using n8n. It receives messages from LINE, processes them with AI, reads and creates events in Google Calendar, and checks Gmail. If the message is text, it uses AI to generate a response or create calendar events, then sends a reply via LINE. It handles errors and cleans text before sending responses.

**Demonstrate**  
A business can use this workflow to automate calendar management and email checks directly from LINE messages, enhancing productivity and ensuring timely responses and event scheduling.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your LINE, Google, and OpenAI accounts.  
3. Adjust webhook and calendar settings.  
4. Test the workflow by sending LINE messages to trigger calendar or email actions.  
5. Monitor and refine the AI responses for accuracy.

**Practice**  
Set up a test Google Calendar and LINE account. Send different text messages to see how the workflow handles them, updating the calendar or checking emails. Adjust AI prompts to refine responses.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated communication and scheduling services, increasing efficiency for clients. It can differentiate your AI automation business by providing seamless integration of messaging and scheduling platforms, leading to potential income growth.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
