# HTTP Form Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, httpRequest, formTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On form submission**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "180", content: "[redacted]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "440", content: "## STEP 2

Submit the form and you will receive a call to the phone number you entered where the selected voice will tell you the content of the text you wrote."
4. **On form submission** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Send Voice Message", formFields: "[object Object]"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "440", content: "## Automate text-to-speech voice calls
This workflow is a simple yet powerful way to automate text-to-speech voice calls using the ClickSend API. It’s ideal for notifications, remi…[truncated]"
6. **Send Voice** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://rest.clicksend.com/v3/voice/send`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending text-to-speech voice calls using the ClickSend API. When a user submits a form with a message, phone number, voice type, and language, the workflow triggers a call to the specified number. The selected voice then reads out the provided message, making it ideal for automated notifications or reminders.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically notify customers about upcoming appointments or payment reminders via a voice call, reducing the need for manual calls and ensuring timely communication.

### Imitate
1. Register with ClickSend to get an API key.
2. Set up the workflow in n8n.
3. Configure the form to collect message content, phone number, voice, and language.
4. Connect the form submission to the ClickSend API call.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a form to ensure the call is triggered correctly.

### Practice
Create a test form with a few sample entries and submit it to see if the workflow sends the voice call as expected. Experiment with different voice and language options to understand the workflow's flexibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated voice call services to clients, enhancing their customer communication strategies. This can lead to increased service offerings and potential income in your automation business by providing a unique, scalable notification solution.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
