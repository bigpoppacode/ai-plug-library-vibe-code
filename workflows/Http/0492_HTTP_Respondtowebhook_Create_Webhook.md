# HTTP Respondtowebhook Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using respondToWebhook×2, if, webhook.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/generate-voice`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "806.0818150700699", height: "495.17470523089514", content: "[redacted]"
4. **If params correct** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
5. **Generate voice** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{{ $json.body.voice_id }}`
6. **Error** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "json", responseBody: "{
  "error": "Invalid inputs."
}"
7. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "binary"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow provides an API endpoint to transform text into speech using Elevenlabs' text-to-speech service. It starts when it receives a POST request with the text and a specified voice ID. If these parameters are correct, it sends a request to Elevenlabs to generate the speech, returning the audio file. If parameters are missing or incorrect, it responds with an error message.

**Demonstrate:**  
A content creator could use this workflow to automate voiceover generation for videos, saving time by converting scripts into spoken audio quickly and efficiently.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up an n8n account and import the workflow.
2. Configure your Elevenlabs API key in n8n.
3. Create a POST request to the workflow's webhook with `voice_id` and `text`.
4. Test to ensure the voice generation works.

**Practice:**  
Create a test with different text inputs and voice IDs. Observe how the workflow handles valid and invalid inputs, and test the audio output for consistency.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated voiceover services, reducing production time and costs for content creation. This can attract clients needing scalable and efficient audio solutions, enhancing your automation business offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpCustomAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
