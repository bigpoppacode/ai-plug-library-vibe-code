# HTTP Stickynote Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, executeWorkflowTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute Workflow Trigger**.
  2. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.

7. **Query Confluence** `httpRequest` — url: `https://n8n-labs.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/search`
8. **Return Tool Response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow is designed to enhance IT support by integrating with a knowledge base. It starts by receiving a query from a parent workflow, refines it using AI into relevant search terms, and sends it to Confluence's API to find matching articles. The results, including article titles, links, and content excerpts, are then sent back to the parent workflow for further processing.

- **Demonstrate**: A business might use this workflow to streamline IT support, allowing users to quickly get answers to their questions by querying a knowledge base directly from a chat platform like Slack.

- **Imitate**: To apply this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your Confluence account, and customize the query transformation logic to fit your knowledge base structure. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and returns the correct information.

- **Practice**: Create a mock query in your knowledge base and run the workflow. Observe how the query is processed and results are returned. Modify the query to see different results and ensure the workflow handles them correctly.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer enhanced IT support solutions, reducing response times and increasing customer satisfaction. This can lead to higher client retention and open opportunities to offer additional automation services, thus generating more income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
