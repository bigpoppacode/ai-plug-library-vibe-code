# HTTP Extractfromfile Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, httpRequest×2, set×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "187.37066290133808", height: "80", content: "**Add direct link to CV and Job description**"
4. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280.2462120317618", height: "438.5821431288714"
5. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "636.2128494576581", height: "598.6675280064023"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "330.5152611046425", height: "240.6839895136402"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "187.37066290133808", height: "80", content: "**Replace OpenAI connection**"
8. **Set Variables** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Download File** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.file_url }}`
10. **Extract Document PDF** `extractFromFile` — operation: **pdf**
11. **OpenAI - Analyze CV** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
12. **Parsed JSON** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of screening resumes. It downloads a resume from a given URL, extracts text from the PDF, and sends this data along with a job description to OpenAI for analysis. OpenAI evaluates the candidate's suitability for the job, providing a matching score, strengths, and weaknesses. The results are then parsed for further use.

### Demonstrate
A recruitment agency could use this workflow to quickly screen large volumes of CVs against specific job descriptions, saving time on initial candidate evaluations and improving the efficiency of the hiring process.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the "Set Variables" node with your file URL and job description.
3. Configure your OpenAI API credentials.
4. Test the workflow with a sample resume.
5. Review the parsed results to ensure accuracy.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by using a sample resume and job description. Run the workflow to see how it evaluates the candidate. Adjust the prompts or parameters to see how different inputs affect the analysis.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated CV screening services, streamlining recruitment processes for clients and saving them time. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and new revenue streams in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
