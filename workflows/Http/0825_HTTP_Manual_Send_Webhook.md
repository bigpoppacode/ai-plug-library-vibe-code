# HTTP Manual Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, httpRequest, executeWorkflowTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Recieve log message**.
  2. **Recieve log message** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
3. **Test workflow** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "860", height: "280", content: "## Send log entries to BetterStack
This workflow can be used in two ways:
1. Save it as a separate workflow to
use if from multiple worflows.
2. Embed it into one workflow to just
…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "660", height: "280"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", height: "200", content: "### Edit me"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "300", height: "580"
8. **Send Log to BetterStack** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**
9. **Send test log message** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to send log messages to BetterStack Logs. It receives log messages from other workflows, formats them into a JSON object containing the log message and its level, and sends this data to BetterStack using an HTTP POST request. This setup helps centralize and monitor logs from various workflows.

### Demonstrate
A developer might use this workflow to consolidate error logs from multiple applications into BetterStack, enabling easier monitoring and troubleshooting of issues across different systems.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your BetterStack endpoint URL and authentication in the HTTP Request node.
3. Trigger the workflow manually or from another workflow to send test log messages.
4. Customize the log message and level fields as needed.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that generates a log message and triggers this workflow to send it to BetterStack. Adjust the message content and observe how it appears in BetterStack. Test with different log levels.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing centralized log management solutions. This capability can attract clients needing robust monitoring systems, potentially increasing your income and client base in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
