# HTTP AWSSQS Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using awsSqs, set, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically tracks the International Space Station (ISS) by fetching its location data every minute. It starts with a Cron node that triggers an HTTP request to get the ISS's position data, including latitude, longitude, and timestamp. The data is then formatted using a Set node and sent to an AWS SQS queue for further processing or storage.

### Demonstrate
A space research organization could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's real-time location, ensuring they have up-to-date data for scheduling observations or coordinating satellite communications.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your AWS SQS credentials.
3. Ensure the HTTP Request node is configured with the correct API URL.
4. Activate the workflow to run every minute.
5. Monitor the AWS SQS queue to verify data is being received.

### Practice
Create a test AWS SQS queue and run the workflow. Confirm that the ISS location data is being added to the queue every minute. Experiment by changing the trigger frequency or modifying the data format in the Set node.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time data tracking and automation services to clients, enhancing your portfolio with cutting-edge automation solutions. This skill can help you attract businesses needing precise and timely data processing, thereby increasing your marketability and potential income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** aws.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
