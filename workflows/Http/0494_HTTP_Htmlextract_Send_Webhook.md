# HTTP Htmlextract Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **HTML Extract Data**.
  2. **HTML Extract Data** `htmlExtract` — options: "[object Object]", dataPropertyName: "item", extractionValues: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking Hacker News for trending posts labeled "Show HN". It runs daily at a set time, retrieves the latest Hacker News page, extracts post titles, URLs, and ranks, and checks if they contain "Show HN". If they do, it compiles these into an email and sends it to a specified recipient.

### Demonstrate
A tech news blogger could use this workflow to stay updated on trending "Show HN" posts, ensuring they quickly cover popular tech discussions and innovations, thus keeping their content timely and relevant.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Cron node with your preferred schedule.
3. Connect your email account to the Send Email node.
4. Customize the email text and recipient details.
5. Test the workflow by manually triggering and checking the email output.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that scrapes another website, like a news site, for specific keywords in headlines. Adjust the extraction and email steps to fit your chosen site and verify the email output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content curation, saving time and ensuring you always have the latest information. This can enhance your productivity and appeal to clients needing automated content monitoring and reporting services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
