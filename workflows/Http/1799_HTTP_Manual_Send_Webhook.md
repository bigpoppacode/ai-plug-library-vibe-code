# HTTP Manual Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, stickyNote×2, webhook.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **Webhook from Line Message** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/638c118e-1c98-4491-b6ff-14e2e75380b6`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "720", height: "340", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "720", height: "340", content: "## Line Message API Send Message

You need to get the Line UID first.
Every user is differnt.

If you have the Line UID. Then you can push the message to the User."
5. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
6. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Line : Reply with token** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/reply`
9. **Line : Push Message** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow interacts with the Line Messaging API to automate responses. It listens for messages via a webhook and checks if the received event is a message. If so, it sends a reply using the provided token. The workflow can also push messages to users if their Line UID is known, facilitating communication automation.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business could use this workflow to automate customer support on Line, instantly replying to messages and pushing notifications or updates to users, enhancing customer interaction and satisfaction.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the webhook to receive Line messages.  
3. Configure the nodes with your Line API credentials.  
4. Customize the message content as needed.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it replies and pushes messages correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Line account and send messages to your webhook. Observe how the workflow replies automatically. Experiment by changing the reply message content to see how it affects the response.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated messaging services, improving client communication strategies. This can lead to new business opportunities, boosting customer engagement and retention, and increasing your income through enhanced service offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
