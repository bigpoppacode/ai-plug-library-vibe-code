# HTTP MQTT Monitor Webhook
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote√ó3, mqttTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Remote Sensor MQTT Trigger**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "340", height: "120", content: "MQTT trigger subscribed to a topic called wokwi-weather via a Mosquitto MQTT broker. The trigger receives the temperature and humidity payloads from a DHT22 sensor connected to a r‚Ä¶[truncated]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî height: "100", content: "Javascript code to extract the temperature and humidity values to ensure correct JSON format for the database"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "260", height: "120", content: "HTTP request node posts temperature and humidity data from the DHT22 sensor to the InfluxDB data bucket running on a local host http://localhost:8086"
5. **Remote Sensor MQTT Trigger** `mqttTrigger` ‚Äî topics: "wokwi-weather", options: "[object Object]"
6. **Payload data preparation node** `code` ‚Äî jsCode: "// Try to parse the incoming message as JSON
let data;
try {
  data = JSON.parse($json.message); // $json.message is expected to be a JSON string
} catch (e) {
  // If parsing fail‚Ä¶[truncated]"
7. **Data ingest to InfluxDB bucket** `httpRequest` ‚Äî method: **POST**, url: `http://localhost:8086/api/v2/write?orgID=<Organization ID>&bucket=<InfluxDB bucket name>&precision=s`
  
  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to collect temperature and humidity data from a remote DHT22 sensor connected to an ESP32 microcontroller. The data is sent via MQTT to the workflow, which then processes it to ensure the correct format and posts it to an InfluxDB database. This setup allows for continuous monitoring and storage of environmental data.

**Demonstrate:**  
A greenhouse owner could use this workflow to monitor climate conditions, ensuring optimal growing conditions by tracking temperature and humidity in real-time.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up an MQTT broker and connect your DHT22 sensor to an ESP32.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Configure the MQTT trigger to listen to your sensor's data topic.
4. Adjust the JavaScript node to parse your specific data format.
5. Connect to your InfluxDB instance and ensure data is stored correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test setup with a mock MQTT broker and sample JSON data to simulate sensor readings. Run the workflow and verify that data is correctly formatted and stored in InfluxDB.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer IoT monitoring solutions, attracting clients in agriculture, smart home, and industrial sectors. This expertise can lead to new business opportunities and recurring income through maintenance and data management services.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mqtt.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
