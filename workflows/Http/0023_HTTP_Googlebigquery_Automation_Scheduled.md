# HTTP Googlebigquery Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using googleBigQuery, set, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically tracks the position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute. It uses a Cron node to trigger an HTTP request to an API that provides the ISS's current coordinates. The data is then processed and stored in a Google BigQuery table, updating it with the latest location information.

### Demonstrate
A space research organization could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position in real-time, enabling them to coordinate observations or plan satellite communications efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google BigQuery credentials.
3. Configure the Google BigQuery node with your project, dataset, and table details.
4. Ensure the HTTP request URL points to a valid API endpoint for ISS data.
5. Activate the workflow to start tracking.

### Practice
Create a test BigQuery dataset and table. Use the workflow to log ISS data for a day. Review the data to understand how the ISS's position changes over time, practicing data extraction and analysis.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you offer real-time data tracking services, expanding your automation offerings. This skill can attract clients needing precise data logging, enhancing your reputation and potential income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleBigQueryOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
