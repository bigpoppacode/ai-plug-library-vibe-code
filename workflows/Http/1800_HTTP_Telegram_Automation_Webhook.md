# HTTP Telegram Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using telegram×2, stickyNote×2, telegramTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Telegram Trigger**.
  2. **Telegram Trigger** `telegramTrigger` — updates: "*", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "691.428571428571", height: "521.142857142858"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "650.2857142857147", height: "524.571428571429", content: "## Using GROQ API

Now we send the image in base64 to the API and get the description of the image."
5. **Receive the File** `telegram` — resource: **file**
6. **convert the image file to base64** `extractFromFile` — operation: **binaryToPropery**
7. **HTTP Request GROQ LLAVA** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions`
8. **Get only the text** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Telegram send the text** `telegram` — text: "={{ $json.choices[0].message.content }}", chatId: "={{ $('Telegram Trigger').item.json.message.chat.id }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of receiving an image file via Telegram, converting it to base64 format, and sending it to the GROQ API. The API processes the image and returns a description, which is then sent back to the original Telegram chat. This allows users to quickly get detailed descriptions of images they send through Telegram.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to quickly get detailed descriptions of product images sent by clients via Telegram, aiding in cataloging or marketing efforts.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Set up a Telegram bot using BotFather and connect it to n8n.
  3. Configure the workflow with your GROQ API token.
  4. Test by sending an image via Telegram to see if you receive a description back.

- **Practice:** Set up a Telegram bot and use this workflow to test sending different types of images. Observe how the descriptions vary and adjust the workflow if necessary to better suit your needs.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer image analysis services, enhancing product cataloging or marketing strategies. This can attract clients looking for automated image processing solutions, providing a potential revenue stream in AI automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** telegramApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
