# HTTP Stickynote Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Airtable Trigger**.
  2. **Airtable Trigger** `airtableTrigger` — table: `[object Object]`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1420", height: "2640"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — content: "## CRM node

Connect it to the table where you store information about your leads or contacts in general."
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — height: "220", content: "## Add contacts to telli

Here you perform a POST request to telli's API to bring your CRM contacts into the telli system."
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — height: "220", content: "## Schedule calls for your new contacts

Right after the contacts have been added, we perform another POST request to the telli API to schedule calls based on our smart calling str…[truncated]"
7. **Add contact request** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.telli.com/v1/add-contact`
8. **Schedule Calls Request** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.telli.com/v1/schedule-call`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of connecting your Airtable contacts with the Telli system for automated voice call scheduling. It starts by triggering on new entries in an Airtable table, adds these new contacts to Telli via an API call, and then schedules voice calls using Telli's smart calling strategy. This integration helps manage and streamline contact follow-ups and communication processes efficiently, reducing manual effort and error.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to ensure that every new lead entered in their CRM is automatically followed up with a personalized AI voice call. This ensures timely engagement, improving lead conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n setup.
2. Connect your Airtable and Telli accounts.
3. Set up your Airtable table with the necessary fields for contact information.
4. Configure the API keys and endpoints in the HTTP Request nodes.
5. Test the workflow by adding a new contact to Airtable and observing the automated call scheduling.

### Practice
Create a test Airtable table with dummy contact data. Run the workflow and watch as it processes the entries to add them to Telli and schedule calls. Adjust the API credentials and mapping to ensure correct operation.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated lead follow-up services, increasing the efficiency of sales processes for clients. This could lead to higher conversion rates and customer satisfaction, offering a valuable service that can be monetized in an automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableTokenApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
