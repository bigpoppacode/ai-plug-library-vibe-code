# HTTP Schedule Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, scheduleTrigger, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "458", height: "404"
4. **setTenant** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Generate OAuth Token** `httpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`
6. **Fetch SharePoint List** `httpRequest` — url: `https://{your-sharepoint-domain}.sharepoint.com/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('YourListTitle')/items`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of fetching data from a SharePoint list. It starts with a scheduled trigger, sets tenant information, generates an OAuth token for authentication, and then retrieves items from a specified SharePoint list. This ensures that you have up-to-date access to SharePoint data without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to regularly update their internal dashboards with the latest data from SharePoint, ensuring team members always have access to current information for decision-making.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the `Schedule Trigger` for your desired interval.
3. Fill in the `setTenant` node with your SharePoint tenant ID.
4. Set up the `Generate OAuth Token` node with your client credentials.
5. Test the `Fetch SharePoint List` node by specifying your SharePoint domain and list title.

### Practice
Create a test SharePoint list with sample data. Run the workflow to see how it retrieves and handles the data. Experiment by changing list titles or intervals to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline data management tasks, saving time and reducing errors. Offering this as a service can attract clients needing automated data retrieval, enhancing your business's value proposition and potentially increasing income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
