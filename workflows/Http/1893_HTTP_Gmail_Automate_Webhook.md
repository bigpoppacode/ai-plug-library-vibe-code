# HTTP Gmail Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Weekly Trigger (Monday 7AM)**.
  2. **Weekly Trigger (Monday 7AM)** `cron` — configured for its default action.
3. **📌 Setup Instructions** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "280", height: "320"
4. **📌 Google Search Console Config** `stickyNote` — color: "2", height: "320", content: ""
5. **📌 Email Node Setup** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "360", content: ""
6. **Get SEO Data from GSC** `httpRequest` — url: `https://searchconsole.googleapis.com/webmasters/v3/sites/YOUR_SITE_URL/searchAnalytics/query`
7. **Generate SEO Report** `function` — functionCode: "
                const rows = items[0].json.rows || [];
                const reportLines = rows.map((row, index) => {
                    return `${index + 1}. ${row.keys[0]} - Cl…[truncated]"
8. **Send Weekly Report by Email** `gmail` — sendTo: "rodrigue.gbadou@gmail.com", options: "[object Object]", subject: "Send Weekly Report by Email"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automatically retrieves SEO data from Google Search Console every Monday at 7 AM. It processes this data to generate a report on the top 10 search queries over the past week, including metrics like clicks and impressions. This report is then emailed to a specified recipient, providing regular SEO insights without manual intervention.

- **Demonstrate:** A digital marketing agency could use this workflow to provide clients with automated weekly SEO performance reports, saving time on manual data extraction and analysis, and ensuring timely delivery of insights.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Set up a Google Search Console account and connect it to n8n.
  2. Use the HTTP Request node to fetch SEO data.
  3. Create a function to process this data into a report.
  4. Set up the Gmail node to email the report.
  5. Schedule it to trigger every Monday at 7 AM.

- **Practice:** Create a test workflow in n8n that fetches mock data, processes it, and sends a summary email. Adjust the data processing logic to experiment with different report formats.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to automate SEO reporting services, a valuable offering for clients looking to improve their online presence. This can enhance your service portfolio, leading to increased client satisfaction and potential revenue growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
