# HTTP Kafka Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using cron, httpRequest, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Kafka**.
  2. **Kafka** `kafka` — channel/topic: `iss-position`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automatically tracks the International Space Station's (ISS) position every minute. It uses a Cron node to trigger an HTTP request that fetches the ISS's current latitude and longitude. The data is then formatted and sent to a Kafka topic called "iss-position" for further processing or analysis.

**Demonstrate**  
A space enthusiast or educational organization could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position in real-time, providing live updates on a website or app to engage users and foster interest in space exploration.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.  
2. Connect your Kafka credentials.  
3. Ensure the HTTP request URL is correctly set to fetch ISS data.  
4. Activate the workflow to start receiving updates.  
5. Customize the Kafka topic if needed for your use case.

**Practice**  
Create a simple Kafka consumer that listens to the "iss-position" topic. Run the workflow and observe the incoming data, experimenting by visualizing it on a map to see the ISS's path.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time data streaming services or educational tools, enhancing your automation portfolio. This can attract clients interested in space data or real-time analytics, boosting your business's income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** kafka.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
