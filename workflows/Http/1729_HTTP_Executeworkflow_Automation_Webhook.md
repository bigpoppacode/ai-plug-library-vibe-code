# HTTP ExecuteWorkflow Automation Webhook
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote√ó8, set√ó5, httpRequest√ó2.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute Workflow Trigger**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", width: "320", height: "540"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", content: "I tested this KNN classifier on a whole `test` set of a dataset (it's not a part of the collection, only `validation` + `train` parts). Accuracy of classification on `test` is **93‚Ä¶[truncated]"
4. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` ‚Äî configured for its default action.
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "460", height: "380", content: "## KNN classification workflow-tool
### This n8n template takes an image URL (as anomaly detection tool does), and as output, it returns a class of the object on the image (out of ‚Ä¶[truncated]"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` ‚Äî height: "200", content: "Variables define another Qdrant's collection with landscapes (uploaded similarly as the crops collection, don't forget to switch it with your data) + amount of neighbours **limitKN‚Ä¶[truncated]"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` ‚Äî height: "80", content: "Similarly to anomaly detection tool, we're embedding input image with the Voyage model"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "740", height: "200", content: "## Tie loop
Here we're [querying](https://api.qdrant.tech/api-reference/search/query-points) Qdrant, getting **limitKNN** nearest neighbours to our image <*Query Qdrant node*>, par‚Ä¶[truncated]"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` ‚Äî height: "80", content: "Here, we extract the name of the input image class decided by the Majority Vote
"
10. **Sticky Note10** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "4", width: "540", height: "260"
11. **Image Test URL** `set` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Embed image** `httpRequest` ‚Äî method: **POST**, url: `https://api.voyageai.com/v1/multimodalembeddings`
13. **Qdrant variables + embedding + KNN neigbours** `set` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow is designed to classify satellite images of land types using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. An image URL is processed to generate an embedding, which is then queried against a Qdrant vector database. The database returns similar images, and a majority vote is used to determine the class of the input image. If there's a tie in classification, the workflow increases the number of neighbors considered until a definitive class is determined.

### Demonstrate
A company dealing with geographical data could use this workflow to automatically classify satellite images of various land types, such as forests or urban areas, for environmental monitoring or urban planning purposes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Qdrant database and upload your image dataset.
3. Configure the Voyage AI API for image embedding.
4. Adjust the workflow to use your dataset and API credentials.
5. Test with sample images to ensure accurate classification.

### Practice
Create a small dataset of labeled satellite images and upload it to Qdrant. Run the workflow with sample images and observe how it classifies them. Experiment with adjusting the number of neighbors to see its effect on classification accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated image classification services, which are valuable for industries like agriculture, urban development, and environmental monitoring. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and create additional revenue streams in the AI automation business.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, qdrantApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
