# HTTP Schedule Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "300", height: "440", content: "The following triggers start the workflow at the Start of the day and the End of the day. Times can be adjusted to user's preference. "
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "460", height: "660"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "800", height: "540"
5. **Morning Trigger To Pull Data At 7:00am** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Evening Trigger To Pull Data At 11:00pm** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Retrieve Data Of Upcoming Sport Events For The Day** `httpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`
8. **Retrieve Sport Results Data At The End Of The Day** `httpRequest` — url: `[redacted]`
9. **Create Records Of Upcoming Events For The Day** `airtable` — operation: **create**, table: `[object Object]`
10. **Combine Sport Results With Upcoming Events Records By Matching ID** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", fieldsToMatchString: "id"
11. **Update Table Records With Scores And Results For Sport Events** `airtable` — operation: **update**, table: `[object Object]`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the retrieval of sports event data using TheOddsAPI and records it into Airtable. It triggers twice daily: at 7:00 AM to fetch upcoming sports events and at 11:00 PM to get the results of those events. The data is stored in Airtable, where morning event data is logged, and evening results are merged with the morning records to update them with scores and outcomes.

### Demonstrate
A sports betting company could use this workflow to automate the collection and updating of sports events data, ensuring they have the latest information for odds and outcomes. This streamlines their data management and enhances their betting services.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and TheOddsAPI accounts.
3. Adjust the schedule triggers to your preferred times.
4. Set up your Airtable base with appropriate fields for sports data.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves and updates data correctly.

### Practice
Create a sample Airtable base and test the workflow with mock sports data. Adjust the schedule triggers to run more frequently to observe the workflow in action and see how data is updated in Airtable.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated sports data management services, increasing efficiency for sports betting or analytics businesses. This can lead to new client opportunities and a competitive edge in the sports data industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, airtableTokenApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
