# HTTP Slack Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On new company created**.
  2. **On new company created** `hubspotTrigger` — eventsUi: "[object Object]", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Get company information** `hubspot` — resource: **company**, operation: **get**
4. **Try to load the domain** `httpRequest` — url: `={{$json["properties"]["domain"]["value"]}}`
5. **Check Result** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]", combineOperation: "any"
6. **Post to Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `#hubspot-alerts`

  1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, hubspotDeveloperApi, hubspotApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
