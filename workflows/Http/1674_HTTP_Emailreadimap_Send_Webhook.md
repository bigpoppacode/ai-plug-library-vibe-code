# HTTP Emailreadimap Send Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **Read emails (IMAP)** `emailReadImap` — options: "[object Object]", postProcessAction: "nothing"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "361", height: "90", content: "## Summarize emails with A.I.
You can find out more about the [use case](https://rumjahn.com/how-a-i-saved-my-kids-school-life-and-my-marriage/)"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "229", height: "280"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "365", height: "442"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "307", height: "439"
7. **Send email to A.I. to summarize** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
8. **Send summarized content to messenger** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.line.me/v2/bot/message/push`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing emails using AI and sending the summaries to a messaging app. It begins by reading emails from an email server using IMAP, then sends the email content to an AI service for summarization. The AI processes the email content, highlighting important information and deadlines. Once summarized, the content is sent to a messaging platform, like LINE, to notify the user in a concise format.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to quickly receive email summaries on their messaging app, helping them stay on top of important messages without having to read lengthy emails, especially while on the go.

### Imitate
1. Import the n8n workflow.
2. Connect your email account using IMAP.
3. Set up the AI summarization service with your API key.
4. Configure the messaging service with your credentials.
5. Test the workflow by sending a few emails and checking the summaries received.

### Practice
Create a test email account and send several test emails with varying importance levels and deadlines. Run the workflow to ensure it correctly summarizes and highlights key information, and sends it to your messaging app.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer email management and summarization services, enhancing productivity for clients. This can lead to increased efficiency in communication, potentially attracting more clients and increasing your revenue in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
