# HTTP Respondtowebhook Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works

  2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "Give me a URL of a video from YouTube to start! 👍"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "300", height: "420"

9. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]", looseTypeValidation: "true"
10. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.supadata.ai/v1/youtube/transcript?url={{ $json.text }}&text=true&lang=pt`
11. **Respond to Webhook - Chat Message** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.text }}"
12. **OpenAI** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
13. **Edit Fields - Respond to Chat Message 2** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow automates the transcription of YouTube videos. When a user submits a YouTube video URL, it validates the URL, retrieves a transcript via the Supadata API, and formats it using OpenAI. The transcript is returned in a structured and readable format, making it easier for users to access video content without watching the entire video.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly transcribe educational YouTube videos into text, saving time on content consumption and enabling easier note-taking and summarization.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a trigger for receiving YouTube URLs.
3. Connect to Supadata and OpenAI with your API keys.
4. Customize the OpenAI prompt to suit your needs.
5. Test the workflow with a YouTube URL to ensure it transcribes correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test workflow using a YouTube video URL of your choice. Run the workflow and verify the transcript output. Experiment by modifying the OpenAI prompt to adjust the structure and format of the transcription.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer transcription services, enhancing content accessibility and usability for clients. This skill can be monetized by providing efficient content summarization and analysis, attracting more customers and increasing revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
