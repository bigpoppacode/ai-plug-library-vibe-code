# HTTP Form Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, stickyNote×2, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Creation Form**.
  2. **Creation Form** `formTrigger` — path: `/my-form-id`
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "275.01592825011585", height: "261.76027109756643"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "202.64787116404852", height: "85.79488430601403"
5. **Config** `set` — include: "selected", options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **Create Stripe Product** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.stripe.com/v1/products`
7. **Create payment link** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_links`
8. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", redirectURL: "={{ $json.url }}", respondWith: "redirect"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates the creation of a Stripe product and payment link based on user input from a form. When a user fills out the form with a product title and price, the workflow converts the price to cents, creates a product in Stripe, generates a payment link, and then redirects the user to the payment page.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to quickly set up new products and payment links on their website, streamlining the process of adding new items to their online store without manually creating each product in Stripe.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
  2. Connect your Stripe account in the credentials section.
  3. Customize the form to suit your product needs.
  4. Test the form to see if it creates a product and payment link successfully.

- **Practice:** Create a test form in n8n with different product names and prices. Submit the form and check if the Stripe dashboard reflects the new products and payment links. Verify the redirection to the payment page.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer streamlined e-commerce solutions to businesses, helping them quickly scale their product offerings. This efficiency can attract more clients and generate additional income by providing automation services that reduce manual setup time.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** stripeApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
