# HTTP Stickynote Import Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, googleDrive×2, httpRequest×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Check GDrive for new images**.
  2. **Check GDrive for new images** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "459.2991776576996", height: "146.4269155371431"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "463.09809221779403", height: "176.7894351639415"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "411.49840818526235", height: "189.2115813199212"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "322.632285684791", height: "189.2115813199212"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "322.632285684791", height: "239.85571564814694"
8. **Download image** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
9. **Optimise - Send image to TinyPNG** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.tinify.com/shrink`
10. **Get optimised image from tinyPNG** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.headers.location }}`
11. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — name: "name.png", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates image optimization for files uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder. It detects new images, downloads them, sends them to TinyPNG for compression, and then saves the optimized images back to a designated Google Drive folder. This process reduces image file sizes, saving storage space and improving loading times.

### Demonstrate
A web developer could use this workflow to automatically optimize images uploaded by clients, ensuring faster website loading times and improved SEO performance by reducing image sizes without losing quality.

### Imitate
1. Connect your Google Drive and TinyPNG API credentials in n8n.
2. Set the Google Drive folder to monitor for new images.
3. Configure the TinyPNG API key in the HTTP Request node.
4. Specify the destination folder in Google Drive for optimized images.
5. Test the workflow by uploading a test image to the monitored folder.

### Practice
Create a Google Drive folder and upload several test images. Run the workflow to see how it processes each image, optimizing and saving them to the specified folder. Adjust settings to test different image sizes and formats.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer efficient image optimization services, enhancing website performance for clients. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and the potential to upsell additional automation services in your AI business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
