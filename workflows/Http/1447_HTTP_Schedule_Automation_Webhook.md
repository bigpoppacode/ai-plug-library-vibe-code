# HTTP Schedule Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using splitOut, scheduleTrigger, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **URLs List** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
4. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "urls"
5. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.url }}`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow periodically checks a list of URLs to ensure they are accessible. It starts with a schedule trigger that activates every 15 minutes, sets up a list of URLs, splits them into individual URLs, and sends an HTTP request to each to verify their availability.

- **Demonstrate:** A website owner could use this workflow to monitor the uptime of their websites. By automatically checking URLs every 15 minutes, they can quickly identify and respond to any downtime, ensuring their sites are always accessible to users.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into your n8n instance. Replace the URLs in the "URLs List" node with your own. Set the schedule in the "Schedule Trigger" node to your desired frequency. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly pings each URL and handles errors.

- **Practice:** Create a test workflow with a few sample URLs. Run the workflow manually and observe the HTTP request results. Modify a URL to be incorrect and see how the workflow reacts. This will help you understand error handling.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer website monitoring services to clients, ensuring their online presence is reliable. This can enhance your service portfolio and potentially increase your income by providing value in website management and uptime assurance.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
