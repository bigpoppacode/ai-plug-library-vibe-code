# HTTP Schedule Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Think** `toolThink` — configured for its default action.
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Gmail** `gmailTool` — sendTo: "simoroosvelt@gmail.com", message: "={{ /*n8n-auto-generated-fromAI-override*/ $fromAI('Message', ``, 'string') }}", options: "[object Object]"
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "520", content: "[redacted]"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "480", height: "300"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "480", height: "300"
9. **Set Your Location Coordinates** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Set User Profile** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Get Air data** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.ambeedata.com/latest/by-lat-lng`
12. **Get Pollen data** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.ambeedata.com/latest/pollen/by-lat-lng`
13. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "Follow the prompt below", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to provide users with personalized environmental health information. It automatically checks air quality and pollen levels at a specific location every day. Using the AI agent, it summarizes the environmental conditions and offers tailored advice based on user profiles, then sends this information via email.

### Demonstrate
A healthcare consultant could use this workflow to send daily environmental health updates to clients with allergies or respiratory conditions, helping them plan their day and reduce exposure to harmful pollutants.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your location coordinates in the "Set Your Location Coordinates" node.
3. Customize the user profile in the "Set User Profile" node.
4. Connect your Gmail account to the workflow.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends the correct environmental summary and suggestions.

### Practice
Create a test user profile with different health sensitivities and run the workflow. Observe how the AI agent tailors its advice based on the profile. Experiment with different locations to see how environmental data changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer personalized environmental health updates as a service, potentially expanding your client base and increasing revenue. It positions you as a knowledgeable provider in the growing field of health and wellness automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
