# HTTP Github Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using github×3, httpRequest×3, function×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Merge1**.
  2. **Merge1** `merge` — mode: "removeKeyMatches", propertyName1: "data.updatedAt", propertyName2: "data.updatedAt"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up and updating workflow data from an n8n instance to a GitHub repository. It retrieves workflows from an n8n instance, processes and merges data, and then creates or updates files in a specified GitHub repository to ensure data backup and version control.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the backup of their n8n workflows to GitHub daily. This ensures that all changes are tracked and can be reverted if necessary, providing a reliable version control system for workflow configurations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up GitHub credentials and specify your repository details.
3. Schedule the workflow to run daily using the cron node.
4. Test the workflow to verify that it creates or updates JSON files in your GitHub repository.

### Practice
Create a test repository on GitHub and run the workflow to back up a few sample workflows from your n8n instance. Check the repository to ensure files are created or updated correctly. Experiment with modifying workflows and observe the changes in GitHub.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated backup solutions to clients, ensuring their data is secure and version-controlled. This can enhance your service offerings, leading to increased client trust and potential revenue growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi, httpBasicAuth, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
