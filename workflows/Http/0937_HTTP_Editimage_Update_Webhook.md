  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of adding custom text to an image. It starts by fetching an image from a URL, then uses a webhook to capture user input. This input is incorporated into the image using an "Edit Image" node, which overlays the text onto the image, creating a personalized graphic.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create personalized marketing materials automatically. For example, when a customer submits their name through a form, the workflow generates a custom image with the customer's name, which can be used in personalized email campaigns.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook node to capture user input (e.g., a name).
3. Configure the HTTP Request node to fetch the desired image.
4. Adjust the Edit Image node to position and style the text overlay.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a name through the webhook URL.

### Practice
Create a simple form that sends a name to the webhook URL. Run the workflow to generate a personalized image with the submitted name. Experiment by changing the text position and style in the Edit Image node to see different results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer personalized content creation services. This can enhance customer engagement and satisfaction, opening new revenue streams through personalized marketing solutions and increasing your value as an automation expert.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
