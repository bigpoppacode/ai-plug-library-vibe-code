# HTTP Cron Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function, set, httpRequest.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow tracks the International Space Station (ISS) position every minute. It sends an HTTP request to an API to get the current location of the ISS, including latitude, longitude, and timestamp. It stores this data, checks for new entries, and logs new coordinates, ensuring you always have the latest position data.

### Demonstrate
A space enthusiast or educator could use this workflow to display real-time ISS data on a website, engaging users by showing the current position of the ISS as it orbits Earth.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the Cron node to trigger every minute.
3. Connect the HTTP Request node to the ISS API.
4. Use the Set node to format the data.
5. Use the Function node to log new coordinates.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to track a different satellite or use different APIs to get real-time data. Experiment by changing the trigger interval or the data you log to see how it affects your results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time data tracking services, such as monitoring satellite positions or other live data streams. This can be a unique selling point for your business, attracting clients who need up-to-date information for decision-making or educational purposes.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
