# Code Schedule Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, httpRequest×2, scheduleTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Friday 8pm** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", height: "340", content: "## Trigger
Set the trigger to run when you like"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "300", height: "340"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "540", height: "220", content: "[redacted]"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "660", height: "340"
8. **Config** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Get Recipes** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.mealieBaseUrl }}/api/recipes`
10. **Generate Random Items** `code` — jsCode: "const numberOfRecipes = $('Config').first().json.numberOfRecipes;
const offsetPlanDays = $('Config').first().json.offsetPlanDays;
const items = $input.first().json.items;

let plan…[truncated]"
11. **Create Meal Plan** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ $('Config').first().json.mealieBaseUrl }}/api/households/mealplans`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates the creation of meal plans using Mealie, a recipe management tool. Every Friday at 8 PM, it retrieves recipes from a specified category, randomly selects a set number of them, and generates a meal plan for the upcoming days. The workflow ensures that meal planning is automated, efficient, and varied.

- **Demonstrate:** A health coach could use this workflow to provide clients with weekly meal plans automatically. It saves time, ensures nutritional diversity, and helps clients stay on track with their dietary goals.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow to n8n.
  2. Set up your Mealie API credentials.
  3. Configure the base URL, number of recipes, and category ID in the Config node.
  4. Test the workflow using the manual trigger.
  5. Activate the schedule trigger for automatic weekly runs.

- **Practice:** Set up a Mealie instance and create a few recipe entries. Use the workflow to generate a test meal plan. Experiment by changing the number of recipes or categories to see how the meal plans differ.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer personalized meal planning services, attract health-conscious clients, and increase your service offerings. This can lead to enhanced client satisfaction and potential for recurring revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
