# Code Webhook Create Webhook
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates lead processing from ERPNext. It triggers on new lead generation, checks if the source is a website and status is open, retrieves lead details, and processes them using AI. The AI categorizes the lead and drafts an email summarizing the inquiry, which is then sent via Microsoft Outlook to the relevant contact.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure every new customer inquiry from their website is promptly categorized and addressed, improving response time and customer satisfaction.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect ERPNext, Google Docs, Sheets, and Microsoft Outlook.  
3. Set up a webhook in ERPNext for new leads.  
4. Customize the Google Sheets and Docs to align with your company data.  
5. Test the workflow with a sample lead to ensure emails are generated and sent correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test lead in ERPNext and observe how the workflow processes it. Verify if the email is correctly drafted and sent to the appropriate contact. Experiment by modifying the lead data and see how the AI categorizes different inquiries.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated lead management solutions, enhancing client communication and efficiency. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction, retention, and potentially higher revenue by converting more leads into clients.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, microsoftOutlookOAuth2Api, googleDocsOAuth2Api, erpNextApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
