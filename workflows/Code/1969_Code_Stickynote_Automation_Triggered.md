# Code Stickynote Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using executeWorkflowTrigger, compression, stickyNote.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute Workflow Trigger**.
  2. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "360", content: "## About
Use me as modular workflow. Instead of building me fixed in your workflow. Just call me when you need me.


## Input
Input can be multiple files 
-imgaes
-pdfs
-xlsx,csv..…[truncated]"
4. **Code Magic** `code` — jsCode: "let binaries = {}, binary_keys = [];

for (const [index, inputItem] of Object.entries($input.all())) {
  binaries[`data_${index}`] = inputItem.binary.data;
  binary_keys.push(`data…[truncated]"
5. **Compression** `compression` — operation: **compress**
6. **Prepare Output** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of compressing multiple files into a single zip file. It starts with a trigger, processes the input files using a code node to prepare them for compression, and then compresses all the files using the Compression node. Finally, it sets the output file name and other relevant details, preparing the zip file for further use or download.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the process of archiving documents, images, or reports at the end of each day, reducing manual effort and ensuring all files are organized and stored efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect the trigger to your desired start event (e.g., a specific time or external input).
3. Ensure your file sources are correctly configured to provide input files.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it compresses files as expected.
5. Adjust file naming conventions as needed in the "Prepare Output" node.

### Practice
Create a test set of files in various formats (e.g., PDF, images, CSV). Run the workflow to see how it compresses these files into a single zip file. Experiment by adding or removing files from the input to observe the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated file management services, saving clients time and reducing errors in document handling. This expertise can help you attract more clients and increase your revenue in the automation and AI services market.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
