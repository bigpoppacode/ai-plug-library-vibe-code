# Code EditImage Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, editImage×3, code×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.

7. **Get the Image for Background** `httpRequest` — url: `https://cloud.let-the-work-flow.com/workflow-data/robot-1.png`
8. **Get Logo for the Watermark** `httpRequest` — url: `https://cloud.let-the-work-flow.com/workflow-data/logo-shadow.png`
9. **Get Meta BG** `editImage` — operation: **information**
10. **Get Meta Top** `editImage` — operation: **information**
11. **Nest Bg Meta** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Nest Top Meta** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Rename Image Binary Background Image** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "$input.item.binary.bg = $input.item.binary.data;
delete $input.item.binary.data;
return $input.item;"
14. **Rename Image Binary Top Image** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "$input.item.binary.top = $input.item.binary.data;
delete $input.item.binary.data;
return $input.item;"
15. **Wait for both Images and merge Binary in one Item** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "mergeByPosition"
16. **Calculate Center** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "

  const centerX = ($input.item.json.metaBg.size.width + $input.item.json.metaTop.size.width) / 2;

17. **Let "top" overlay "bg"** `editImage` — operation: **composite**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow overlays a background image with another image, acting as a watermark or logo. It fetches both images, retrieves their metadata, and calculates the position to place the overlay image at the center of the background. The final output is a composite image with the overlay properly positioned.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to automatically add watermarks to images before sharing them with clients, ensuring their work remains protected and branded.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect to the image sources.
3. Adjust the position calculations if needed.
4. Run the workflow to test the watermark placement.
5. Save the final composite image.

### Practice
Create a test with different background and overlay images. Adjust the overlay position to place the watermark in various locations like corners or off-center, and observe the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer image watermarking services, protecting digital assets and enhancing brand identity. This could lead to attracting new clients and generating additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
