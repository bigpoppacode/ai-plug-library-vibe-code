# Code Manual Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, readWriteFile, stickyNote.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "218", height: "132", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Create HTML** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Convert HTML to File** `code` — jsCode: "const text = $node["Create HTML"].json["data"]
const buffer = Buffer.from(text, 'utf8');
const binaryData = {
  data: buffer.toString('base64'),
  mimeType: 'application/octet-stre…[truncated]"
6. **Convert File to PDF** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://v2.convertapi.com/convert/html/to/pdf`
7. **Write Result File to Disk** `readWriteFile` — operation: **write**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting HTML content into a PDF file. It starts with a manual trigger, creates an HTML document, converts this HTML into a file format, sends it to an online service to convert the file to a PDF, and finally writes the PDF to disk. 

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to automate the generation of PDF reports from HTML templates for clients, saving time and ensuring consistent formatting for each report.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect a manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Customize the HTML content in the "Create HTML" node.
4. Ensure the ConvertAPI credentials are set up for file conversion.
5. Test the workflow to make sure the PDF is created and saved correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple HTML file with your details and run the workflow to convert it into a PDF. Modify the HTML to include different styles or content and see how the workflow handles these changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated document creation services, increasing efficiency and consistency. This skill can attract clients needing automated report generation or document management, enhancing your service offerings and revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpQueryAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
