# Code Schedule Export Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set, scheduleTrigger, stickyNote.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "560", height: "140"
4. **Parameters** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Get all n8n Workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
6. **Code** `code` — jsCode: "return items.map(item => {
  const jsonData = JSON.stringify(item.json);
  const binaryData = Buffer.from(jsonData).toString('base64');
  item.binary = {
    data: {
      data: bi…[truncated]"
7. **Backup to Google Drive** `googleDrive` — name: "={{  $json.name+ ".json"}}", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup of your n8n workflows to Google Drive. It begins with a schedule trigger that runs at a specified time, retrieves all n8n workflows, converts them into a base64 format using a code node, and then uploads them to a specified Google Drive folder. This ensures that your workflow data is securely backed up regularly, reducing the risk of data loss.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically back up their n8n workflows daily to Google Drive. This is crucial for data security, ensuring that if any changes or disruptions occur, the workflows can be easily restored from the backup.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the schedule trigger for your preferred backup time.
3. Set up your Google Drive credentials and folder ID in the Parameters node.
4. Test the workflow by running it manually to ensure it backs up the workflows correctly.

### Practice
Create a test n8n workflow and run the backup workflow to see how it saves the workflow data to Google Drive. Modify the backup schedule and observe how the changes affect the backup timing.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer reliable backup solutions to clients, enhancing their data security. This service can be a valuable addition to your automation business, attracting clients who prioritize data integrity and disaster recovery.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
