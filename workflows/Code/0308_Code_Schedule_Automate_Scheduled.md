# Code Schedule Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing and reporting new UX ideas from a Notion database. It runs weekly, retrieves the latest entries, filters for UX-related ideas, counts them, and then sends a summary message to a specified Slack channel.

**Demonstrate:** A product manager could use this workflow to keep their team updated on new UX ideas. By automating this reporting process, the team can focus more on evaluating and implementing ideas rather than manually tracking them.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the JSON workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your Notion and Slack accounts. 3. Set the schedule trigger to your preferred time. 4. Customize the Notion database and Slack channel to fit your needs. 5. Test the workflow by executing it manually.

**Practice:** Create a test Notion database with sample UX ideas. Run the workflow and see how it filters and counts the entries, then sends the summary to Slack. Adjust the filter criteria to explore different data views.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data reporting, enhancing efficiency and communication. This skill can attract clients who need streamlined operations and real-time updates, boosting your AI automation business's value proposition.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, slackApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
