  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending the latest company news before meetings. Every morning at 7 AM, it checks your Google Calendar for meetings starting with "Meeting with" or "Call with." It extracts the company name from the meeting title, fetches the latest news articles about the company using an API, formats the news into an email, and sends it to specified recipients.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to prepare for daily meetings with clients by receiving the latest news about each client‚Äôs company, enhancing meeting preparedness and fostering informed discussions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Calendar and Gmail accounts.
3. Set up an API key for a news service.
4. Configure the emails to receive the news.
5. Test the workflow to ensure emails are sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a test meeting in your Google Calendar with a title like "Meeting with ExampleCorp." Run the workflow to see if it fetches and emails the latest news articles about "ExampleCorp."

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer a valuable service to business professionals who need to stay informed about their clients, enhancing your consultancy or automation business. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and potential upsells in meeting preparation services.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, googleCalendarOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
