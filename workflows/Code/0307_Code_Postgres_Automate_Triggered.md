# Code Postgres Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Postgres Trigger**.
  2. **Postgres Trigger** `postgresTrigger` — schema: "[object Object]", firesOn: "UPDATE", tableName: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "424", height: "559", content: "## 👋 How to use this template
This template shows how to sync data from one service to another. In this example we're saving a new qualified lead to a Google Sheets file. Here's h…[truncated]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "344", height: "562", content: "### 1. Trigger step listens for new events

5. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — width: "462", height: "407", content: "### 2. Filter and transform your data
















In this case, we only want to save qualified users that don't have `@n8n.io` in their email address.

6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "342.52886836027733", height: "407.43618112665195", content: "### 3. Save the user in a Google Sheet
















For simplicity, we're saving our qualified user in a Google Sheet.

**You can replace this node with any service like [Excel]…[truncated]"
7. **On clicking "Execute Node"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
8. **Code** `code` — jsCode: "return [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "max_mustermann",
    "email": "max_mustermann@acme.com",
    "company_size": "500-999",
    "role": "Sales",
    "users": 50
  }
]"
9. **Filter** `filter` — conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — operation: **appendOrUpdate**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow listens for updates in a Postgres database. When a user is updated, it checks if the user's email does not contain "@n8n.io". If the email is valid, the user's information is added or updated in a Google Sheets document. This ensures that only qualified leads with acceptable email addresses are saved for further action.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update their CRM system with leads that meet specific criteria, ensuring their marketing efforts are targeted effectively.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Postgres and Google Sheets accounts.  
3. Set the Postgres Trigger to listen for updates in your desired table.  
4. Configure the filter to exclude emails containing "@n8n.io".  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates Google Sheets correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test Postgres table and add some entries. Update an entry and observe how the workflow filters and processes the data, updating a Google Sheet only if the email passes the filter.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer data synchronization services, ensuring clients have up-to-date and valid lead information. This can enhance marketing strategies and improve client satisfaction, leading to more business opportunities and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
