# Code Executecommand Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×9, form×4, code×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On form submission**.

10. **Sticky Note13** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "216.47293010628914", height: "376.16893354714523"
11. **On form submission** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Credential Transfer", formFields: "[object Object]"
12. **Settings** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Get Instance Names** `code` — jsCode: "dropDownValues = [];

for (const instance of $input.first().json.remoteInstances) {
  dropDownValues.push({"option": instance.name});
}

return { "options": JSON.stringify(dropDown…[truncated]"
14. **Choose Instance** `form` — options: "[object Object]", defineForm: "json", jsonOutput: "=[
   {
      "fieldLabel": "Destination",
      "fieldType": "dropdown",
      "requiredField": true,
      "fieldOptions": {
        "values": {{ $json.options }}
      }
   }
]"
15. **Export Credentials** `executeCommand` — command: "n8n export:credentials --all --pretty --decrypted --output=/tmp/cred"
16. **Get Credentials Data** `readWriteFile` — options: "[object Object]", fileSelector: "/tmp/cred"
17. **Binary to JSON** `extractFromFile` — operation: **fromJson**
18. **Get Credential Names** `code` — jsCode: "dropDownValues = [];

for (const credential of $input.first().json.data) {
  dropDownValues.push({"option": credential.name});
}

return { "options": JSON.stringify(dropDownValues)…[truncated]"
19. **Choose Credential** `form` — options: "[object Object]", defineForm: "json", jsonOutput: "=[
   {
      "fieldLabel": "Credential",
      "fieldType": "dropdown",
      "requiredField": true,
      "fieldOptions": {
        "values": {{ $json.options }}
      }
   }
]"
20. **Prepare Request Data** `code` — jsCode: "output = {};

for (const credential of $('Binary to JSON').first().json.data) {
  if (credential.name == $input.first().json.Credential) {
    output.credential = credential;
  }
}…[truncated]"
21. **Create Credential** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ $json.instance.baseUrl }}/credentials`
22. **Success** `form` — operation: **completion**
23. **Error** `form` — operation: **completion**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to transfer credentials from one n8n instance to another. It begins with a form submission to initiate the process. The workflow retrieves instance names and credential data, allowing the user to select the destination instance and specific credentials to transfer. It then exports, reads, and prepares the credentials for transfer, sending them to the specified instance. Confirmation or error messages are displayed based on the success of the transfer.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to easily migrate credentials between different n8n environments, ensuring that their automation processes remain functional and secure after transitioning to a new system or during system upgrades.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Configure your instances in the "Settings" node with names, API keys, and base URLs.
3. Trigger the workflow via the form submission node.
4. Select the destination instance and credentials to transfer.
5. Test the workflow to ensure credentials are transferred successfully.

### Practice
Create a test scenario where you transfer credentials between two dummy n8n instances. Observe the process and verify the credentials are correctly transferred and functional in the new instance.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer seamless credential management as a service, streamlining complex migrations and system updates for clients. This can enhance your service offerings and increase customer satisfaction, leading to higher retention and new opportunities in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
