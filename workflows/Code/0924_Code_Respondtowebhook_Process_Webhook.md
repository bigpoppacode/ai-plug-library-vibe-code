# Code Respondtowebhook Process Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using code×7, respondToWebhook×2, webhook.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Webhook1** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/flow`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "580", height: "1900", content: "## Try it out

### 🔗 **1. Webhook Entry & Initial Decryption Block**

**Nodes involved:**

* `Webhook1`
* `move to base64`
* `[partially visible node for decryption using RSA + AE…[truncated]"
4. **move to base64** `code` — jsCode: "console.log($json);

  {
    encryptedFlowData: Buffer.from($json.body?.encrypted_flow_data || "", "base64"),
    encryptedAesKey: Buffer.from($json.body?.encrypted_aes_ke…[truncated]"
5. **Decryption Code** `code` — jsCode: "const crypto = require("crypto");

const privateKey = `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
[INSERT YOUR KEY HERE]
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`;

// Convert input buffers
const encryptedAesKe…[truncated]"
6. **Json Parser** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
7. **Switch** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
8. **Data Extraction Code** `code` — jsCode: "const groupedAppointments = items.reduce((acc, { json: { appointment_date, start_time } }) => {
  const dateKey = new Date(appointment_date).toISOString().split('T')[0];
  if (!acc…[truncated]"
9. **Data Extraction Code1** `code` — jsCode: "const jsonData = items;

// Parse the decryptedPayload string into a JSON object
const decryptedPayload = JSON.parse(jsonData[0].json.originalPayload.decryptedPayload);

// Extract…[truncated]"
10. **Encrypt Return** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
11. **Encrypt Return1** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
12. **Respond to Webhook1** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.body }}"
13. **Respond to Webhook2** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.body }}"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow processes encrypted data received via a webhook. It decrypts the data using RSA and AES, parses it to determine the type of request (e.g., "APPOINTMENT" or "DATE_SELECTION_SCREEN"), and extracts relevant information such as appointment details or seat selections. The workflow then re-encrypts the response and sends it back via a webhook response, ensuring secure data handling throughout the process.

### Demonstrate
A healthcare provider could use this workflow to handle encrypted patient appointment requests. The system would decrypt incoming requests, process appointment data, and securely return available slots, streamlining scheduling while maintaining patient confidentiality.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive encrypted data.
2. Use nodes to convert incoming data to base64 and decrypt it using RSA and AES.
3. Parse the decrypted data to determine the request type.
4. Extract relevant data based on the request type.
5. Re-encrypt the response and send it back using a webhook response node.

### Practice
Create a test webhook to simulate receiving encrypted appointment requests. Manually encrypt sample data to test the decryption and parsing process. Verify that the workflow correctly processes different types of requests and returns appropriate responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer secure data processing services to clients who handle sensitive information. This capability can help you attract clients in healthcare, finance, or any industry requiring secure data exchange, boosting your automation business's value proposition.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
