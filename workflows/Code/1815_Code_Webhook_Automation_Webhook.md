# Code Webhook Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×21, switch×4, if×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **API** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/docker-influxdb`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "639", height: "909"
4. **Parametrs** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
6. **Container Stat** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
7. **Container Actions** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
8. **InfluxDB** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
9. **If1** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **422-Invalid server domain** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "json", responseBody: "[{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Invalid server domain"
}]"
11. **Inspect** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Stat** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Log** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Start** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Stop** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
16. **Mount Disk** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **Unmount Disk** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
18. **GET ACL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
19. **SET ACL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
20. **GET NET** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
21. **Version** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
22. **Change Password** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
23. **nginx** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
24. **Deploy-docker-compose** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
25. **Service Actions** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
26. **Test Connection1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
27. **Deploy** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
28. **Suspend** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
29. **Unsuspend** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
30. **Terminated** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
31. **ChangePackage** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
32. **SSH** `ssh` — cwd: "=/", command: "={{ $json.sh }}"
33. **Code1** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "try {
  if ($json.stdout === 'success') {
    return {
      json: {
        status: 'success',
        message: '',
        data: '',
      }
    };
  }

  const parsedData = JSON…[truncated]"
34. **API answer** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "allIncomingItems"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the deployment and management of InfluxDB Docker containers. It listens for API requests, handles container actions like starting, stopping, and mounting disks, and manages configurations such as ACLs and network settings. It ensures proper setup and maintenance of InfluxDB instances using Docker.

- **Demonstrate:** A developer could use this workflow to automate the deployment of InfluxDB instances for different clients, ensuring consistent setups and reducing manual errors. It saves time and ensures uniform configurations across multiple deployments.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n, configure the webhook and SSH credentials, and adjust parameters like `server_domain` and paths to match your setup. Run the workflow by sending POST requests to the webhook endpoint with appropriate commands to manage your Docker containers.

- **Practice:** Set up a test environment with Docker and InfluxDB. Use the workflow to deploy a new InfluxDB instance, modify its configuration, and perform actions like starting and stopping the container. Observe the workflow's behavior and log outputs.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated Docker-based InfluxDB deployment services, enhancing your portfolio in AI automation. It can attract clients seeking reliable and efficient database solutions, leading to increased income opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth, sshPassword.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
