# Code Schedule Export Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×7, set×3, httpRequest×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Workflow changes committed to the repository"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Check if there are any changes in the workflow"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Create a new file for the workflow"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Check if file exists in the repository"
7. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Get all workflows"
8. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Set variables"
9. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "560", height: "1620", content: "[redacted]"
10. **Globals** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automatically backs up your workflows to a Git repository on Gitea. It checks for changes in your workflows every 45 minutes, creates or updates files in the repository accordingly, ensuring your automation workflows are securely stored and version-controlled.

- **Demonstrate:** A developer might use this workflow to ensure their automation workflows are always backed up and versioned, allowing easy recovery or rollback if needed. This is crucial for maintaining workflow integrity and tracking changes over time.

- **Imitate:** To apply this workflow: 1) Import it into your n8n setup. 2) Configure the Gitea repository details in the Globals node. 3) Set up Gitea authentication tokens. 4) Test the workflow to ensure it correctly backs up your workflows. 5) Activate the schedule trigger.

- **Practice:** Start by creating a test repository in Gitea and use this workflow to back up a few sample workflows. Check the repository to ensure files are correctly created and updated. Modify a workflow and observe how the backup reflects this change.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer backup and version control services for automation workflows, enhancing reliability and confidence for clients. This can be a valuable add-on to your automation business, increasing client trust and potential income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
