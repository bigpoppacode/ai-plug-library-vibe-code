# Code Respondtowebhook Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using webhook, memoryBufferWindow, lmChatGoogleGemini.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **Webhook** at `POST` **/b0631bec-9ccc-4eb8-b143-d73609b213c7**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/b0631bec-9ccc-4eb8-b143-d73609b213c7`
3. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $json.body.userId }}", sessionIdType: "customKey", contextWindowLength: "50"
4. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash"
5. **Discord AI Response Agent** `agent` — text: "=Username: {{ $json.body.userName }}

Question/Prompt: {{ $json.body.question }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
6. **correctNaming** `code` — jsCode: "// Hole alle Items
const items = $input.all();

// Nehme das erste Item (falls mehrere vorhanden sind)
const item = items[0];

// Extrahiere den output
const antwort = item.json.ou…[truncated]"
7. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "allIncomingItems"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates responses to questions asked on Discord about YouTube videos from a specific channel. It begins with a Webhook that captures incoming questions, stores session data using Simple Memory, and processes the question using the Google Gemini Chat Model. The Discord AI Response Agent formulates a response, which is formatted via a code node before being sent back to the user who asked the question.

### Demonstrate
A YouTube channel owner could use this workflow to manage viewer questions about their videos on Discord, providing immediate and consistent responses even when they're not available to answer personally.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Webhook to capture incoming Discord messages.
3. Connect your Google Gemini and Discord credentials.
4. Customize the AI agent's prompt to suit your content.
5. Test the workflow with sample questions to ensure proper responses.

### Practice
Create a Discord server and set up a test channel. Use the workflow to respond to questions about a series of fictional YouTube videos. Adjust the AI agent's prompts and observe how changes affect the responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate customer interactions, enhancing engagement and freeing up your time. As a service offering, it can help you attract content creators seeking to scale their audience interaction effortlessly, thereby increasing your revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googlePalmApi.
2. **Expose Webhook:** Map your external app to the listed path/method; test with curl/Postman before activation.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
