# Code Form Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On form submission**.
  2. **On form submission** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Example Title", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Google Sheets Trigger** `googleSheetsTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "960", height: "240", content: "## Form setup

- Customize your form fields. 
- The dropdown field will auto-update with values from your data source. 
- Other form fields can be added as needed (limited to one d…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "400", content: "## Data source setup

- Connect to your Google Sheet containing dropdown values
- Node can be replaced with any other data source (API, database)
- Set timing trigger"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "260", height: "400", content: "## Data formatting

- Extracts needed data from source
- Renames field to 'value' (do not change this name)"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — height: "400", content: "## Nested properties

- Transforms the data to the desired format"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — height: "400", content: "## Get Workflow 

- Gets the current workflow data"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — height: "400", content: "## Add Dropdown Values 
- Replaces the nested parameters of the Dropdown Form Field with the nested properties sourced from the data."
10. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — height: "400", content: "## Update Form 

- Replaces the current workflow’s JSON with the updated JSON containing the new Dropdown values."
11. **Execute Workflow** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]"
12. **Get all values** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
13. **Format to 'values'** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Write JSON** `code` — jsCode: "const inputArray = items.map(item => item.json);

const output = [
  {
    nodes: [
      {
        parameters: {
          formFields: {
            values: [
              {
    …[truncated]"
15. **n8n | get wf** `n8n` — operation: **get**
16. **Replace values** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
17. **n8n | update** `n8n` — operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**
This n8n workflow dynamically updates a form's dropdown field options by syncing them with data from a Google Sheet. When a form is submitted, it triggers the workflow to fetch values from a specified Google Sheet, formats these values, and updates the form's dropdown options accordingly. This ensures the dropdown options are always current with the data in the Google Sheet.

**Demonstrate:**
A business owner can use this workflow to keep a customer feedback form updated with the latest list of product categories from a Google Sheet, ensuring customers always select from the most current options.

**Imitate:**
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Google Sheets account and specify the sheet containing dropdown values.
3. Customize the form fields and ensure the dropdown field is set up correctly.
4. Test the workflow by submitting the form and checking if the dropdown updates.

**Practice:**
Create a simple Google Sheet with a list of options. Set up the workflow to pull these options and update a form's dropdown field. Submit the form and verify the dropdown reflects the latest Google Sheet data.

**WIIFM:**
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer dynamic form solutions to clients, ensuring their forms are always up-to-date with the latest data. This can enhance user experience, improve data accuracy, and increase your value as an automation expert, potentially leading to new business opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, googleSheetsTriggerOAuth2Api, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
