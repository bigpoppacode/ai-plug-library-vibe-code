# Code Schedule Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **Airtable2** `airtableTool` — table: `[object Object]`
4. **OpenAI Chat Model1** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
5. **8:00am Morning Scheduled Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "280", height: "440"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "860", height: "360"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "940", height: "460"
9. **Pull List of Pinterest Pins From Account** `httpRequest` — url: `https://api.pinterest.com/v5/pins`
10. **Update Data Field To Include Organic** `code` — jsCode: "// Initialize an array to hold the output formatted for Airtable
const outputItems = [];

for (const item of $input.all()) {
  if (item.json.items && Array.isArray(item.json.items)…[truncated]"
11. **Create Record Within Pinterest Data Table** `airtable` — operation: **upsert**, table: `[object Object]`
12. **Pinterest Analysis AI Agent** `agent` — text: "You are a data analysis expert. You will pull data from the table and provide any information in regards to trends in the data. 

Your output should be suggestions of new pins that…[truncated]", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
13. **Pinterest Data Analysis Summary LLM** `chainSummarization` — options: "[object Object]"
14. **Send Marketing Trends & Pinterest Analysis To Marketing Manager** `gmail` — sendTo: "john.n.foster1@gmail.com", message: "={{ $json.response.text }}", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates the analysis of Pinterest data to generate marketing insights. It starts by pulling data from Pinterest, processes and stores it in Airtable, and uses AI to analyze trends and suggest content ideas. The results are then summarized and emailed to a marketing manager, providing actionable insights to enhance Pinterest marketing strategies.

**Demonstrate:**  
A marketing manager could use this workflow to automate the process of analyzing Pinterest performance weekly, ensuring they receive consistent, data-driven insights to refine their content strategy and improve engagement.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and Gmail accounts.
3. Schedule the workflow to run weekly.
4. Customize the Airtable table to match your Pinterest data structure.
5. Test the workflow with sample data.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Airtable base and populate it with mock Pinterest pin data. Run the workflow to see how it processes and analyzes the data, then adjust the AI prompts to refine the marketing insights generated.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer Pinterest analysis as a service, providing clients with valuable insights to optimize their marketing efforts. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, airtableTokenApi, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
