# Code Schedule Export Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, set×3, code×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "371.1995072042308", height: "600.88409546716"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1066", height: "435"
6. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "170", height: "120"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "150", height: "80"
8. **Get Squarespace data** `httpRequest` — url: `https://beyondspace.studio`
9. **Get Header Injection** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Get Footer Injection** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Clean up Headers** `code` — jsCode: "const cheerio = require('cheerio');

try {
    const $headers = cheerio.load($input.first().json.value);
    let sqsHeaders = '';

    // Find the Squarespace CSS link that marks t…[truncated]"
12. **Clean up Footers** `code` — jsCode: "const cheerio = require('cheerio');

try {
    const $footers = cheerio.load($input.first().json.value);
    let sqsFooters = '';

    /** CLEAN FOOTERS */
    // Remove all elemen…[truncated]"
13. **Merge Injections** `merge` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### **Explain**
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up Squarespace header and footer code injections to a GitHub repository. It retrieves the header and footer data from a Squarespace site, cleans the data to remove unnecessary elements, and then saves the cleaned data into a specified GitHub repository at regular intervals or manually triggered. This ensures that any custom code injected into the Squarespace site is safely stored and versioned for future reference or recovery.

### **Demonstrate**
A web developer managing multiple Squarespace sites could use this workflow to maintain a version-controlled backup of all custom code injections. This helps in quick recovery in case of accidental deletions or site issues, ensuring business continuity.

### **Imitate**
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Configure the Squarespace URL in the 'Get Squarespace data' node.
3. Set up your GitHub credentials in the 'Edit Injection data' and 'Create Injection data' nodes.
4. Adjust the repository details in the 'Globals' node.
5. Test the workflow by executing it manually or setting a schedule.

### **Practice**
Create a test Squarespace site and add custom header and footer code. Use this workflow to back up those injections to a GitHub repository. Experiment with modifying the code on Squarespace and observe the changes in GitHub after running the workflow.

### **WIIFM**
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer reliable backup solutions for web developers and agencies managing multiple Squarespace sites. This can lead to increased client trust and potential upsell opportunities for additional automation services, boosting your income and reputation in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
