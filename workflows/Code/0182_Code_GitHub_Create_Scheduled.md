# Code Github Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "1910.7813046051347", height: "731.7039821513649"
4. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "385", height: "417"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1272.6408145680155", height: "416.1856906618075"
8. **Config** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
9. **Starting Message** `slack` — text: "=:information_source:  Starting Workflow Backup [{{ $execution.id }}]", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"
10. **Get file data** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **get**
11. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
12. **If file too large** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **Get File** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.download_url }}`
14. **Merge Items** `merge` — configured for its default action.
15. **isDiffOrNew** `code` — jsCode: "const orderJsonKeys = (jsonObj) => {
  const ordered = {};
  Object.keys(jsonObj).sort().forEach(key => {
    ordered[key] = jsonObj[key];
  });
  return ordered;
}

// Check if fi…[truncated]"
16. **Create sub path** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
17. **Check Status** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{$json.github_status}}", dataType: "string"
18. **Same file - Do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
19. **File is different** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
20. **File is new** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
21. **Edit existing file** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **edit**
22. **Create new file** `github` — resource: **file**
23. **Return** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the backup of all workflows to GitHub every 24 hours. It checks if local workflows have changed, creates a new file or updates existing ones in GitHub, and notifies via Slack upon completion. This ensures all workflows are safely stored and versioned.

- **Demonstrate:** A software development company could use this workflow to automatically back up their workflow automations to GitHub, ensuring they have a version history and can easily restore previous versions if needed.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
  2. Set up GitHub and Slack credentials.
  3. Configure repository details in the Config node.
  4. Activate the Schedule Trigger to run daily.
  5. Test by executing the workflow manually.

- **Practice:** Create a test GitHub repository and run the workflow to back up a few sample workflows. Check GitHub to ensure files are created/updated, and verify Slack notifications are received.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated backup solutions to businesses, ensuring their automations are secure and versioned. This can increase client trust and open opportunities for recurring revenue through maintenance services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
