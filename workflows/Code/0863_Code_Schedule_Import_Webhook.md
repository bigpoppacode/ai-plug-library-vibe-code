# Code Schedule Import Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Daily Trigger1** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note16** `stickyNote` — content: "[redacted]"
4. **Sticky Note17** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "280", content: "### 📄 How to Connect Google Sheets in n8n

To connect your Google Sheets to n8n:

1. Go to your n8n Credentials page.
2. Select **Google Sheets** and add new credentials.

5. **Sticky Note18** `stickyNote` — width: "280", height: "260", content: "### About Me

6. **Set Date1** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
7. **Fetches today’s Product Hunt posts via API.** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql`
8. **Extracts Product Info** `code` — jsCode: "return $json.data.posts.edges.map(edge => {
  return {
    json: {
      name: edge.node.name,
      tagline: edge.node.tagline,
      description: edge.node.description,
      web…[truncated]"
9. **Resolve Website Redirection** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.website }}
`
10. **Data 1 (product info)** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
11. **Data  2 (website url)** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
12. **Merge Data** `function` — functionCode: "// Initialize empty arrays for both data sources
let productData = [];
let redirectData = [];

try {
  productData = $items("Data to Keep4");
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Error…[truncated]"
13. **Appends all details** `googleSheets` — operation: **appendOrUpdate**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting the latest posts from Product Hunt daily, extracting relevant product information, resolving website redirections, and storing the data in Google Sheets. It helps keep an up-to-date record of new product launches.

**Demonstrate:**  
A startup could use this workflow to track new product launches on Product Hunt, helping them keep an eye on potential competitors or partners, and quickly assess market trends.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Product Hunt API and Google Sheets accounts.  
3. Schedule the trigger to run daily.  
4. Customize the Google Sheets column names if needed.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is correctly appended.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Google Sheet and run the workflow. Verify that new product data from Product Hunt is correctly logged each day. Adjust the columns or data fields as necessary to suit your needs.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer services in market research automation, helping businesses stay informed about industry trends. This can enhance your service offerings and potentially increase revenue through new client engagements.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
