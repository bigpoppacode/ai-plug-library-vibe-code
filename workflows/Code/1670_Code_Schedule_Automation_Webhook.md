# Code Schedule Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, httpRequest×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "614.709677419355", height: "208.51612903225802"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "214.75050403225822", height: "531.7318548387107", content: "[redacted]"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "225.99936321742769", height: "508.95792207792226"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "331.32883116883124", height: "474.88"
8. **Get data from SerpBear** `httpRequest` — url: `https://myserpbearinstance.com/api/keyword?id=22`
9. **Parse data from SerpBear** `code` — jsCode: "const keywords = items[0].json.keywords;
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];

// Create summary for each keyword
const keywordSummaries = keywords.map(kw => {
 co…[truncated]"
10. **Send data to A.I. for analysis** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
11. **Save data to Baserow** `baserow` — operation: **create**, table: `644`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing keyword rankings for a website. It retrieves keyword data from SerpBear, processes the information to summarize SEO performance, sends the data to an AI service for analysis, and saves the results into a Baserow database. This helps in understanding keyword trends and improving SEO strategies.

- **Demonstrate:** A digital marketing consultant could use this workflow to automate the process of tracking and analyzing keyword rankings for client websites, providing insights on performance and areas for improvement.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Set up an n8n instance.
  2. Connect your SerpBear and Baserow accounts.
  3. Configure the workflow with your API keys and URLs.
  4. Customize the JavaScript code for data parsing if needed.
  5. Test the workflow and ensure the data flows correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a test environment with a sample SerpBear dataset. Run the workflow to see how it processes and outputs the data to Baserow. Modify the data or code and observe the changes in the results.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated SEO insights to clients, enhancing your service offerings and potentially increasing your revenue through value-added services in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, baserowApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
