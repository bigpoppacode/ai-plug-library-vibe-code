# Code Schedule Monitor Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the monitoring of specific topics from RSS feeds and provides AI-generated summaries in Slack. It retrieves RSS feed URLs from Google Sheets, filters new articles, classifies their relevance using AI, summarizes relevant articles, and posts these summaries to a Slack channel. 

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner can use this workflow to keep their team updated on industry trends by automatically summarizing relevant articles and sharing them in a dedicated Slack channel.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up a Google Sheet with RSS feed URLs.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Connect your Google Sheets, OpenAI, and Slack accounts.
4. Adjust the RSS feed URLs and categories for relevance.
5. Activate the workflow to start receiving summaries in Slack.

**Practice:**  
Create a Google Sheet with a few RSS feed URLs on topics of interest. Run the workflow and observe how it filters, classifies, and summarizes articles, then posts them to Slack.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated information monitoring as a service, helping clients stay informed with minimal effort. This can enhance your service offerings and increase revenue in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleApi, slackOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
