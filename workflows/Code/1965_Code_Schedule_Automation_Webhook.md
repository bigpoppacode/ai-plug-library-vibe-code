# Code Schedule Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, httpRequest×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "614.709677419355", height: "208.51612903225802"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "214.75050403225822", height: "531.7318548387107", content: "[redacted]"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "225.99936321742769", height: "508.95792207792226"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "331.32883116883124", height: "474.88"
8. **Get data from SerpBear** `httpRequest` — url: `https://myserpbearinstance.com/api/keyword?id=22`
9. **Parse data from SerpBear** `code` — jsCode: "const keywords = items[0].json.keywords;
const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];

// Create summary for each keyword
const keywordSummaries = keywords.map(kw => {
  c…[truncated]"
10. **Send data to A.I. for analysis** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
11. **Save data to Baserow** `baserow` — operation: **create**, table: `644`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the analysis of SEO keyword performance using SerpBear data. It retrieves keyword data, evaluates trends, and sends the data to an AI for further analysis. The AI's insights are then stored in a Baserow database for ongoing tracking and strategic planning.

**Demonstrate:**  
A digital marketing agency could use this workflow to regularly analyze keyword performance, helping clients optimize their SEO strategy by identifying trends and areas needing improvement.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your SerpBear and OpenRouter AI accounts.
3. Set up a schedule to automate data retrieval.
4. Customize the Baserow table for storing AI insights.
5. Test to ensure data flows correctly from SerpBear to AI and Baserow.

**Practice:**  
Create a test keyword dataset in SerpBear and run the workflow. Review how the AI analyzes trends and updates Baserow. Modify keywords to see how the analysis changes.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer SEO analysis as a service, providing clients with actionable insights to enhance their online presence. This can increase your service offerings, lead to higher client retention, and generate new income streams in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, baserowApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
