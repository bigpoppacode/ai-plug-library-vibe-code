# Code Github Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, noOp×3, github×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "2086.845881354743", height: "750.8363163824032"
4. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "371.1995072042308", height: "600.88409546716"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "886.4410237965205", height: "434.88564057365943"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "150", height: "80"
8. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
9. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
10. **Globals** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Get file data** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **get**
12. **If file too large** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **Get File** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.download_url }}`
14. **Merge Items** `merge` — configured for its default action.
15. **isDiffOrNew** `code` — jsCode: "const orderJsonKeys = (jsonObj) => {
  const ordered = {};
  Object.keys(jsonObj).sort().forEach(key => {
    ordered[key] = jsonObj[key];
  });
  return ordered;
}

// Check if fi…[truncated]"
16. **Check Status** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{$json.github_status}}", dataType: "string"
17. **Same file - Do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
18. **File is different** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
19. **File is new** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
20. **Edit existing file** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **edit**
21. **Create new file** `github` — resource: **file**
22. **Return** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up workflows to GitHub. It checks if a workflow file already exists in the GitHub repository. If it does, it compares the current workflow with the existing one to determine if there are changes. If the file is new or different, it updates or creates a new file in the repository. This ensures that all workflows are backed up and version-controlled, maintaining a history of changes.

- **Demonstrate:** A developer could use this workflow to automatically back up all their n8n workflows to GitHub, ensuring they have a version history and a secure backup. This is crucial for maintaining code integrity and enabling easy rollback if needed.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into your n8n instance. Set up GitHub credentials in the Globals node. Configure the repository details (owner, name, path). Run the workflow manually or set it to trigger on a schedule. Check GitHub to confirm workflows are backed up.

- **Practice:** Create a new n8n workflow or modify an existing one. Run the backup workflow to see it reflected in your GitHub repository. Change the workflow again and rerun the backup to observe versioning.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated backup solutions to clients, enhancing data security and version control. This can attract new clients and increase income by offering peace of mind with reliable workflow management and backup services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, githubApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
