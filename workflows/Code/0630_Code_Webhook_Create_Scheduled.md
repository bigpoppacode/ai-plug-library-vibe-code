# Code Webhook Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using code×2, stickyNote×2, webhook.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/a227afae-e16e-44c2-bb5c-e69fe553b455`
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "660", height: "400", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "180", height: "420"
6. **1. initiate static data** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
7. **if token is valid** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]", looseTypeValidation: "true"
8. **get new accessToken** `httpRequest` — url: `http://your-api.com`
9. **2. set token in static data** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
10. **continue with valid token** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow manages API access tokens by checking their validity and refreshing them if necessary. It starts with a webhook or scheduled trigger, checks if the current token is still valid, and if not, requests a new token from an API. This new token is then stored for future use, ensuring uninterrupted service.

- **Demonstrate**: A developer managing an application that requires API access might use this workflow to automatically refresh access tokens, ensuring continuous access without manual intervention, thus maintaining seamless integration with third-party services.

- **Imitate**: 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Connect your webhook or schedule trigger.
  3. Set the API endpoint in the HTTP Request node.
  4. Customize the static data storage to fit your token storage needs.
  5. Activate the workflow and test it by expiring the token manually.

- **Practice**: Create a test API that requires token authentication. Set up the workflow to manage token refreshes. Manually expire the token and observe the workflow's ability to request and store a new token.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a critical automation service to clients who rely on API integrations, thus enhancing their system reliability and reducing downtime. This skill can help you attract clients needing robust API management solutions, increasing your value and income potential in automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
