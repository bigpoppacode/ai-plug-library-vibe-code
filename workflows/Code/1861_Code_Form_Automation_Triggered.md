  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **n8n Form Trigger**.
  2. **n8n Form Trigger** `formTrigger` — path: `/c07c8eb6-cf56-4941-91cc-e3cb31c90b5c`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "2256.3366317584496", height: "851.9587677224575"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "510.8381838182147", height: "206.48715095387286", content: "### Links to Node Documentation:

5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1105.0652438372836", height: "630.9350509674927", content: ""
6. **Extracting Date and Time Fields from 'submittedAt' Field** `code` — jsCode: "// Loop over input items and separate date and time into two new fields

  const submittedAt =…[truncated]"
7. **Format the Fields** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", include: "selected", options: "[object Object]"
8. **Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
9. **Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **create**, table: `[object Object]`
10. **Gmail1** `gmail` — sendTo: "={{ $json.Email }}", message: "=Dear {{ $json.Name }} ..

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data processing from a form submission. It captures form data (Name, City, Email), processes it to extract the date and time of submission, formats the data, and then stores it in both Google Sheets and Airtable for record-keeping. It also sends a confirmation email to the submitter with personalized content.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the collection of customer inquiries from their website. It ensures data is neatly stored for analysis and follow-up, reducing manual data entry and improving response times.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your form using the n8n Form Trigger node.
3. Connect Google Sheets and Airtable accounts.
4. Customize fields in the 'Format the Fields' node as per your form.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a form entry.

### Practice
Create a test form and submit different entries. Check how the data is formatted and stored in Google Sheets and Airtable. Verify the personalized email you receive for each submission, ensuring the flow works as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps streamline data management and communication processes, enhancing client satisfaction. By offering such automation services, you can attract more clients, improve operational efficiency, and potentially increase your income through automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableTokenApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
