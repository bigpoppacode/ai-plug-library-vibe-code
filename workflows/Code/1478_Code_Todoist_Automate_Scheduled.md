# Code Todoist Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **RSS Feed: Times of India** `rssFeedRead` — url: `https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/-2128936835.cms`
4. **Gmail: Fetch Emails** `gmail` — operation: **getAll**
5. **TodoList: Fetch Tasks** `todoist` — operation: **getAll**
6. **Merge** `merge` — numberInputs: "3"
7. **Format Digest: Merge & Style Data** `code` — jsCode: "const newsItems = $input.all().map(item => item.json);
const emails = $("Gmail: Fetch Emails").all().map(item => item.json);
const tasks = $("TodoList: Fetch Tasks").all().map(item…[truncated]"
8. **Gmail: Send Digest** `gmail` — sendTo: "youremail@gmail.com", message: "={{ $json.email.body }}", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a daily digest by gathering the latest news from the Times of India RSS feed, fetching recent emails from Gmail, and retrieving tasks from Todoist. It merges this data into a styled summary and emails it as a daily digest, helping users stay organized and informed.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to receive a daily summary of important news, emails, and tasks, allowing them to start their day informed and focused, without having to manually check multiple sources.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail and Todoist accounts.
3. Set up the Schedule Trigger for your desired time.
4. Customize the RSS feed URL if needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure the email digest is formatted and sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a test version of the workflow using your own RSS feed, email, and task management accounts. Run the workflow manually to see how it compiles and sends the digest, and tweak the styling or content to match your preferences.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer personalized daily digest services to clients, enhancing their productivity and providing a unique value proposition. This skill can attract more clients and increase your service offerings, leading to greater income potential in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, todoistApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
