# Code Schedule Send Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using ftp, scheduleTrigger, mqtt.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Convert to File - base64 to binary**.
  2. **Convert to File - base64 to binary** `convertToFile` — operation: **toBinary**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up data from a Zigbee2MQTT server. It starts with a scheduled trigger every Monday at 2:45 am to send a backup request to the Zigbee2MQTT server. Once the backup response is received, the workflow parses the JSON data, converts the base64-encoded backup file into binary, and uploads it to an SFTP server for secure storage.

### Demonstrate
A smart home provider could use this workflow to ensure that their Zigbee network configurations are backed up regularly and securely. This prevents data loss and facilitates quick recovery in case of system failures.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the CRON trigger for the desired schedule.
3. Configure the MQTT node with your Zigbee2MQTT server details.
4. Ensure the SFTP server credentials are correctly set for file uploads.
5. Test the entire flow to validate the backup process.

### Practice
Create a test MQTT topic and simulate a backup response. Use the workflow to process this data and verify that the file is correctly converted and uploaded to a test SFTP server.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer reliable backup solutions for IoT networks, ensuring data integrity and security. This can attract clients who need robust data protection services, enhancing your automation business's value and profitability.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** sftp, mqtt.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
