# Code Github Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, set×3, noOp×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "2547", height: "751"
4. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "371.1995072042308", height: "600.88409546716"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "886.4410237965205", height: "434.88564057365943"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "150", height: "80"
8. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
9. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
10. **tag?** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **/** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Globals** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Get file data** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **get**
14. **If file too large** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
15. **Get File** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.download_url }}`
16. **Merge Items** `merge` — configured for its default action.
17. **isDiffOrNew** `code` — jsCode: "const orderJsonKeys = (jsonObj) => {
  const ordered = {};
  Object.keys(jsonObj).sort().forEach(key => {
    ordered[key] = jsonObj[key];
  });
  return ordered;
}

// Check if fi…[truncated]"
18. **Check Status** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{$json.github_status}}", dataType: "string"
19. **Same file - Do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
20. **File is different** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
21. **File is new** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
22. **Edit existing file** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **edit**
23. **Create new file** `github` — resource: **file**
24. **Return** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates backing up workflows to GitHub. It starts with a schedule or manual trigger, retrieves workflow data, checks if it already exists on GitHub, and if not, creates a new file or updates an existing one. This ensures all workflows are safely stored and version-controlled in a GitHub repository.

**Demonstrate**  
A software development team might use this workflow to automatically back up their n8n workflows to GitHub every day. This practice helps prevent data loss and makes it easier to track changes or revert to previous versions if needed.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up GitHub credentials in n8n.
3. Configure the "Globals" node with your GitHub repository details.
4. Customize the schedule trigger for your desired backup frequency.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly backs up workflows to GitHub.

**Practice**  
Create a simple test workflow in n8n and run the backup workflow. Check your GitHub repository to see if the backup appears. Modify the test workflow, run the backup again, and verify that changes are reflected in GitHub.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated backup solutions, ensuring data integrity and easy version management for clients. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract clients needing reliable automation solutions, and generate ongoing income through maintenance contracts.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, githubApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
