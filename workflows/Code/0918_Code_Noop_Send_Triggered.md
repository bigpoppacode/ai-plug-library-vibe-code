# Code Noop Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Triggered on Restaurant Chat workflow**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model1** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "340", height: "680"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "460", height: "680"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "440", height: "680"
6. **Triggered on Restaurant Chat workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
7. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]"
8. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
9. **Call n8n Workflow Tool** `toolWorkflow` — workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "This tool sends the text output generated by the AI Agent node to another n8n workflow for additional handling or automation.", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
10. **Last 5 conversations Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "340", height: "300", content: "## Restaurant Order Chat bot
** It chats with the user and refines the order for the pos system in another workflow."
12. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", content: "## Call the subworkflow
it passes the data to the subworkflow for further process
"
13. **Information Extractor** `informationExtractor` — text: "={{ $json.query }}", options: "[object Object]", schemaType: "fromJson"
14. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
15. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
16. **No Operation, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
17. **Code** `code` — language: "python", pythonCode: "# Input from n8n
input_data = items

# Get the extracted list
extract_data = input_data[0].get('json', {}).get('output', {}).get('parameters', {}).get('extract', [])

# Prepare var…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow acts as a restaurant order chatbot. It interacts with users to take orders, extracts order details like item names, quantities, and table numbers, and refines this data. The workflow uses AI to ensure orders are accurate and then logs the orders in a Google Sheet for processing through a POS system.

- **Demonstrate:** A restaurant could use this workflow to automate the order-taking process, ensuring that all customer orders are correctly logged and ready for fulfillment, reducing human error and speeding up service.

- **Imitate:** 1) Import the workflow into n8n. 2) Connect OpenAI and Google Sheets. 3) Configure the chatbot to your restaurant's menu. 4) Test the workflow by simulating a chat order. 5) Verify that orders are logged correctly in Google Sheets.

- **Practice:** Set up a test environment with sample menu items and table numbers. Run the workflow by simulating a customer order and check how the workflow processes and logs the data.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer advanced chatbot solutions to restaurants, enhancing their order accuracy and efficiency. This can attract new clients and increase your service offerings, driving revenue growth in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
