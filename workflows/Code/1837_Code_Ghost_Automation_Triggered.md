# Code Ghost Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, formTrigger, extractFromFile.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Upload PDF**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "461", height: "359.27075107113785"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "508.8267597424673", height: "532.0416571599118"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "370.4721755771028", height: "352.3823858238478"
5. **Upload PDF** `formTrigger` — path: `/pdf`
6. **gpt-4o-mini** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`
7. **Structured Output - JSON** `outputParserStructured` — jsonSchemaExample: "{
    "title": "title",
    "content": "content"
}"
8. **Extract Text** `extractFromFile` — operation: **pdf**
9. **Create Structured Blog Post** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.text }}", agent: "conversationalAgent", options: "[object Object]"
10. **Separate Title & Content** `code` — jsCode: "try {
  // Check if input exists and has the expected structure
  const input = $input.all();
  if (!input || !input.length) {
    throw new Error('No input data received');
  }

 …[truncated]"
11. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **Post to Ghost** `ghost` — operation: **create**
13. **Do Nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates the process of converting a PDF document into a blog post. It starts by allowing users to upload a PDF, extracts the text, and uses an AI agent to generate a structured blog post with a title and content. The AI ensures the content is engaging and SEO-friendly. Finally, it checks if the title and content are valid and posts the draft to a Ghost blogging platform.
  
- **Demonstrate:** A content creator can use this workflow to efficiently turn research papers or whitepapers into blog posts, saving time and ensuring the content is structured for online readers.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Connect your Ghost account and OpenAI API.
  3. Set the PDF upload path and test with a sample document.
  4. Ensure the AI settings align with your blog's style.
  5. Test the workflow to see the post draft on Ghost.

- **Practice:** Create a simple PDF with text and upload it through the workflow. Check the draft blog post in Ghost, and adjust the AI settings to better fit your content style.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can streamline content creation, allowing you to offer blog writing services to clients or automate your own content production, increasing efficiency and potentially generating more income through enhanced online presence.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** ghostAdminApi, openAiApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
