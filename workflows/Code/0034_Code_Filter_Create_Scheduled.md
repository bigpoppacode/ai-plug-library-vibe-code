# Code Filter Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "1290.936043660723", height: "407.6508589002549", content: "## Check if the song is present in the database"
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "1481.5336029736159", height: "416.7665808180022", content: "## Check if the playlist present in the database"
4. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "1733.785946789966", height: "351.94195615011336", content: "## Check if the song is in the Spotify playlist. If not, add it."
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Get current date** `code` — jsCode: "const monthNames = [
  'January',
  'February',
  'March',
  'April',
  'May',
  'June',
  'July',
  'August',
  'September',
  'October',
  'November',
  'December',
]

const date…[truncated]"
7. **Get all user playlist** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**, operation: **getUserPlaylists**
8. **Get last 10 liked tracks** `spotify` — resource: **library**
9. **Get monthly playlist** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **Monthly playlist exist in Spotify ?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **Get playlist in DB** `nocoDb` — operation: **getAll**, table: `mchan0xys9h7h7e`
12. **Create playlist in Spotify** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**, operation: **create**
13. **Playlist exist  in DB ?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **Create playlist in DB1** `nocoDb` — operation: **create**, table: `mchan0xys9h7h7e`
15. **Create playlist in DB** `nocoDb` — operation: **create**, table: `mchan0xys9h7h7e`
16. **Clean op** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  Explain: This workflow automates the management of Spotify playlists based on monthly liked tracks. It checks if a monthly playlist exists in Spotify and a database, creates it if not, and adds liked songs to the playlist if they are not already present. It ensures your Spotify playlist is up-to-date with your most recent liked songs, organized by month.

Demonstrate: A music curator could use this workflow to automatically update monthly playlists with their latest liked tracks, ensuring their collection stays fresh and organized without manual effort.

Imitate: Import the workflow into n8n, connect your Spotify and database accounts, and set a schedule trigger to run monthly. Customize the steps to match your playlist naming conventions and database structure. Test the workflow to ensure it updates playlists as expected.

Practice: Create a test Spotify account and a mock database. Add a few liked tracks and run the workflow to observe how it updates the playlist. Adjust some track details and rerun to see the workflow's response.

WIIFM: Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated playlist management services to clients, enhancing their music curation processes. This could lead to new business opportunities in the music and entertainment industry, allowing you to expand your automation service offerings and increase revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** spotifyOAuth2Api, nocoDbApiToken.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
