# Code Github Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, noOp×3, github×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
  2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "2086.845881354743", height: "750.8363163824032"
4. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "365.19481715599653", height: "596.4810912485963"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1028.7522287279464", height: "434.88564057365943"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "150", height: "80"
8. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
9. **Execute Command** `executeCommand` — command: "npx n8n export:credentials --all --decrypted"
10. **Globals** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **JSON formatting** `code` — jsCode: "// Function to beautify JSON
function beautifyJson(jsonString) {
  try {
    // Parse the JSON string
    const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);

    // Format the JSON with in…[truncated]"
12. **Get file data** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **get**
13. **If file too large** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **Get File** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.download_url }}`
15. **Merge Items** `merge` — configured for its default action.
16. **isDiffOrNew** `code` — jsCode: "const orderJsonKeys = (jsonObj) => {
  const ordered = {};
  Object.keys(jsonObj).sort().forEach(key => {
    ordered[key] = jsonObj[key];
  });
  return ordered;
}

// Check if fi…[truncated]"
17. **Check Status** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{$json.github_status}}", dataType: "string"
18. **Same file - Do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
19. **File is different** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
20. **File is new** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
21. **Edit existing file** `github` — resource: **file**, operation: **edit**
22. **Create new file** `github` — resource: **file**
23. **Return** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup of all instance credentials to a GitHub repository. It exports credentials, checks for differences with existing files, and updates or creates new files in the repository based on the comparison. This ensures that all credentials are securely backed up and up-to-date.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing multiple client projects could use this workflow to automate the backup of their credentials. This ensures that all credentials are safely stored and easy to retrieve, reducing the risk of data loss and improving project management efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure your GitHub credentials in the `Globals` node.
3. Set a schedule in the `Schedule Trigger` node to run the workflow at desired intervals.
4. Test the workflow by executing it manually to ensure credentials are exported and backed up correctly.

### Practice
Create a test GitHub repository and simulate the workflow by exporting sample credentials. Observe how the workflow updates or creates files based on changes. This will help you understand the backup process and ensure everything is functioning as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated credential management services, ensuring data security and reliability for clients. This can lead to increased trust and potential upsell opportunities in your automation business, providing a competitive edge.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
