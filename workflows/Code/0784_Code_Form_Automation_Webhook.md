# Code Form Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, code×2, formTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Form**.
  2. **Form** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Form", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "320", content: "# 👆
Please add authentication to form by selecting Basic Auth to prevent unauthorized access to the form.
"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "520", height: "180"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", content: "# 👆
In Authentication, you need to select Predefined Credential Type and then choose Google Docs OAuth API."
6. **Copy template file** `googleDrive` — operation: **copy**
7. **Format form data** `code` — jsCode: "const data = [];

Object.keys($('Form').all().map((item) => {
  Object.keys(item.json).map((bodyProperty) => {
    data.push({
      key: bodyProperty,
      value: item.json[bodyP…[truncated]"
8. **Format form data to Google Doc API** `code` — jsCode: "const result = [];

$('Format form data').all().map((item) => {
  item.json.webhook_data.map((data) => {
    if ("submittedAt" !== data.key && "formMode" !== data.key) {
      resu…[truncated]"
9. **Replace data in Google Doc** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://docs.googleapis.com/v1/documents/{{ $('Copy template file').first().json.id }}:batchUpdate`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting form data and integrating it into a Google Doc template. It triggers when a form is submitted, copies a Google Doc template, formats the form data, and replaces placeholders in the copied template with submitted data, producing a customized document.

### Demonstrate
A business consultant could use this workflow to automatically generate personalized proposal documents for each new client inquiry received through a web form, saving time and ensuring consistency across documents.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Google Drive and set up form authentication.
3. Customize the Google Doc template with placeholders matching form fields.
4. Configure form fields and test the form submission.
5. Verify the document creation and data replacement.

### Practice
Create a test form with fields like "Name" and "Address". Set up the workflow to replace these in a Google Doc template. Submit the form and check if the document is generated with the correct details.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated document generation services, enhancing client interactions and saving time. This skill can attract clients seeking efficiency in document handling, boosting your automation business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, googleDocsOAuth2Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
