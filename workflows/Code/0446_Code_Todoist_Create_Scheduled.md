# Code Todoist Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using todoist×4, stickyNote×3, scheduleTrigger×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "424.4907862645661", height: "154.7766688696994"
3. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "351.4230769230764", height: "222.50000000000006"
4. **Every day at 5:10am** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Every day at 5am** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "256.14371825927645", height: "100"
7. **Get all tasks from template project** `todoist` — operation: **getAll**
8. **Get all tasks from Inbox** `todoist` — operation: **getAll**
9. **Parse task details** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "const item = {};

item.description = $input.item.json.description;
item.content = $input.item.json.content;

const parts = item.description.split(';').map((v) => v.trim());
parts.f…[truncated]"
10. **If list not empty** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **Keep tasks that match today** `filter` — conditions: "[object Object]", combineConditions: "OR"
12. **if it has daily label** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **Create new task in Inbox** `todoist` — labels: "daily", content: "={{ $json.content }}", options: "[object Object]"
14. **Delete task** `todoist` — operation: **delete**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the daily task management process using Todoist. Every day, it retrieves tasks from a template project and the Inbox at specific times. It parses task details to check if they are due today, then creates new tasks in the Inbox with a "daily" label if they match today's date. It also checks the Inbox for tasks with the "daily" label and deletes them, ensuring only relevant tasks are kept.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner uses this workflow to automate daily task setup. It ensures that every day, new tasks are generated based on a predefined template, saving time and ensuring consistency in task management.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Todoist account.
3. Set up a template project in Todoist with tasks including day and time details.
4. Run the workflow to ensure tasks are created and labeled correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a template project in Todoist. Add tasks with descriptions like "days:mon,tues; due:8am." Run the workflow and check if tasks appear in the Inbox with the correct label and timing.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow helps streamline daily task management, saving time and reducing manual entry errors. As a service, it can be offered to businesses looking to automate routine task setups, enhancing efficiency and reliability in their operations.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** todoistApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
