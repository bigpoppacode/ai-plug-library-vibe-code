  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating YouTube video descriptions by inserting a specified line of text between two existing lines. It retrieves a set number of videos, identifies the specific location within the descriptions, and updates them accordingly. This is particularly useful for YouTube creators who need to consistently update multiple video descriptions with new links or information without manual editing.

### Demonstrate
A YouTuber launching a new product might use this workflow to quickly add a promotional link to all their video descriptions, ensuring consistency and saving time from manual updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your YouTube account.
3. Define the text to insert and the lines to insert between.
4. Set a trigger to run the workflow (e.g., manually or on a schedule).
5. Test the workflow to confirm it updates video descriptions as intended.

### Practice
Create a test YouTube channel and upload a few videos. Use the workflow to update descriptions with a specific link. Modify the text to see how changes reflect in the descriptions, ensuring the workflow operates correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer YouTube description management services, helping clients maintain up-to-date and consistent video information. This can expand your service offerings and potentially increase your income as a part of an AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
