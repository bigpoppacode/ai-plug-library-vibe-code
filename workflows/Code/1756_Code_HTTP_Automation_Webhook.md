# Code HTTP Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
3. **OpenAI Chat Model1** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Accept and Publish** `toolWorkflow` — name: "submit", workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "Call this tool when the article quality is above the threshold we need"
5. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "What topics should I write about?"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "940", height: "680"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "860", height: "880"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "640", content: "## Editor Agent

- Sole purpose is to look at the quality of output for the previous combo of perplexity & openAI Agent.
- Determines if it is publishable or not."
9. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "460", height: "480"
10. **Initialize Count** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the creation of knowledge base articles. It uses AI to write and edit articles based on received chat messages. The workflow checks the quality of the draft and decides if it should be published or revised.
  
- **Demonstrate:** A content manager could use this workflow to efficiently generate and publish high-quality articles by automating the writing and editing process, saving time and ensuring consistency.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n, connect your OpenAI account, configure the chat trigger with your topics, and map the outputs to your content platform. Test to ensure articles are generated and published as expected.

- **Practice:** Set up a simple chat trigger to suggest article topics, then run the workflow to see how the AI generates content. Experiment with different topics to see how the workflow handles various inputs.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated content creation services, reducing manual writing efforts and increasing content output. This can enhance your service offerings and generate additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
