# Code Schedule Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Run workflow every day** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "300", content: "## VPS upgrade notify 
This workflow will everyday check if server has upgradable packages and inform you by email if there is."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "300", content: "## Update email addresses
Update From and To email addresses in this node to receive notifications"
5. **List upgradable packages** `ssh` — command: "apt list --upgradable"
6. **Format as HTML list** `code` — jsCode: "function formatStdoutAsHtmlList(stdoutData) {

    // Split the stdout into lines and map to HTML list items
    const htmlListItems = stdoutData.split('\n').map((line) => {
      …[truncated]"
7. **Check if there are updates** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Send Email through SMTP** `emailSend` — html: "=The following packages can be updated on your server:

{{ $json.htmlList }}

Please login and perform upgrade.", options: "[object Object]", subject: "Server needs updates"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically checks every day if there are any upgradable packages on a server using the SSH command `apt list --upgradable`. If updates are available, it formats the list of upgradable packages into an HTML format and sends an email notification to inform the user about the available updates.

### Demonstrate
A system administrator could use this workflow to keep servers up-to-date. It ensures that they are notified promptly of any available updates, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and ensuring optimal performance.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Update the SSH credentials to connect to your server.
3. Set your email addresses in the SMTP node.
4. Schedule the workflow to run daily.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly identifies updates and sends emails.

### Practice
Create a test server with outdated packages. Run the workflow and observe how it identifies the updates and sends an email. Modify the server to have no updates and verify that no email is sent.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer server maintenance automation services, ensuring client servers are secure and updated. This can lead to increased trust and potential upsells in your IT or automation service business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** sshPassword, smtp.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
