# Code Extractfromfile Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **WhatsApp Trigger**.
  2. **WhatsApp Trigger** `whatsAppTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", updates: "messages"
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "=memory_{{ $('WhatsApp Trigger').item.json.contacts[0].wa_id }}", sessionIdType: "customKey", contextWindowLength: "10"
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1340", height: "240", content: "## Text"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "1340", height: "240", content: "## Voice"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1340", height: "240", content: "## Image"
8. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "1340", height: "240", content: "## Document"
9. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1340", height: "600"
10. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "780", height: "2680"
11. **Input type** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
12. **Text** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Get Audio Url** `whatsApp` — resource: **media**, operation: **mediaUrlGet**
14. **Get Image Url** `whatsApp` — resource: **media**, operation: **mediaUrlGet**
15. **Only PDF File** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
16. **Not supported** `whatsApp` — operation: **send**
17. **Download Audio** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.url }}`
18. **Download Image** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.url }}`
19. **Get File Url** `whatsApp` — resource: **media**, operation: **mediaUrlGet**
20. **Incorrect format** `whatsApp` — operation: **send**
21. **Transcribe Audio** `openAi` — resource: **audio**, operation: **transcribe**
22. **Analyze Image** `openAi` — resource: **image**, operation: **analyze**
23. **Download File** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.url }}`
24. **Audio** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
25. **Image** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
26. **Extract from File** `extractFromFile` — operation: **pdf**
27. **File** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
28. **AI Agent1** `agent` — text: "={{ $json.text }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
29. **From audio to audio?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
30. **Generate Audio Response** `openAi` — resource: **audio**
31. **Send message** `whatsApp` — operation: **send**
32. **Fix mimeType for Audio** `code` — jsCode: "for (const item of $input.all()) {
  if (item.binary) {
    const binaryPropertyNames = Object.keys(item.binary);
    for (const propName of binaryPropertyNames) {
      if (item.b…[truncated]"
33. **Send audio** `whatsApp` — operation: **send**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow processes WhatsApp messages using AI to analyze and respond to texts, voice messages, images, and PDFs. It begins with a WhatsApp trigger that captures incoming messages, identifies the type of media, and uses OpenAI to transcribe, analyze, or respond based on the content. It manages different media types, transcribes audio, analyzes images, extracts text from PDFs, and sends responses back to the sender through WhatsApp.

- **Demonstrate:** A consultant could use this workflow to automate customer support on WhatsApp, providing instant AI-driven responses to inquiries, thus improving customer satisfaction and reducing response time.

- **Imitate:** To apply this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your WhatsApp and OpenAI accounts, configure the message types you want to handle, and test it with sample messages. Adapt the AI responses to suit your business needs.

- **Practice:** Send different types of media (text, audio, image, PDF) to your WhatsApp number and observe how the workflow processes each type. Adjust the AI responses for each media type to ensure they provide useful information.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer advanced, AI-driven customer service solutions to businesses using WhatsApp. This can enhance customer engagement, attract new clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** whatsAppTriggerApi, httpHeaderAuth, openAiApi, whatsAppApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
