# Code Schedule Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "230", height: "300"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "371.1995072042308", height: "600.88409546716"
6. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
7. **Get all rows** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
8. **Get all Users** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.n8n_url }}`
9. **Combine all paginated results** `code` — jsCode: "let results = [];
for (let i = 0; i < $input.all().length; i++) {
  results = results.concat($input.all()[i].json.data);
}

return results;"
10. **Get non-users** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", advanced: "true"
11. **Create users list** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Invite Users** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.n8n_url }}`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of inviting users from a Google Sheets document to an n8n instance. It retrieves user data from Google Sheets, compares it with existing users in n8n, and invites users who are not yet in the system. The workflow can be triggered manually or scheduled to run at specific intervals.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to streamline onboarding by automatically inviting new employees listed in a Google Sheet to their internal n8n system, ensuring timely access to necessary tools and resources.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and n8n accounts.
3. Set up the Google Sheet with columns for email and other user details.
4. Adjust the n8n URL in the workflow to match your instance.
5. Test the workflow manually to ensure it invites new users as expected.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with sample user data. Run the workflow to see how it processes the data and invites the users. Modify user details to see how the workflow adapts and updates the user invitations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated onboarding solutions to clients, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual errors. This skill can increase your service offerings and provide a competitive edge in the automation business, attracting more clients and generating additional revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, httpHeaderAuth, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
