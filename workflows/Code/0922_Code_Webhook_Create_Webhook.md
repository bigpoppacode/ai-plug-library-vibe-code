# Code Webhook Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×6, respondToWebhook×3, if×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **Webhook** at `POST` **/secure-webhook**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/secure-webhook`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "360", height: "460"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "1740", height: "240"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "460", height: "460"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "440", height: "460"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "760", height: "780"
8. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "760", height: "240"
9. **Configuration** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Check Authorization Header** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **Has required fields?** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "if(! $json.config.requiredFields) {
  return { json: { valid: true } };
}

const body = $('Webhook').first().json.body;

let requiredFields = $json.config.requiredFields;

for (let…[truncated]"
12. **401 Unauthorized** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "json", responseBody: "[redacted]"
13. **Check Valid Request** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **Add workflow nodes here** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
15. **400 Bad Request** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "json", responseBody: "{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Bad Request: Missing required fields",
  "hint": "Make sure all required fields are included in the request body."
}"
16. **Create Response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **200 OK** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to secure a webhook by verifying incoming requests. It checks for a valid authorization token and required fields in the request body. If both checks pass, it processes the request and responds with a success message. If not, it returns an error response indicating unauthorized access or missing fields, ensuring only authenticated and properly structured requests are processed.

### Demonstrate
A software developer could use this workflow to secure a public API endpoint, ensuring only authorized clients can interact with their service and that all necessary data is provided, enhancing security and data integrity.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your desired Bearer token in the Configuration node.
3. Define required fields in the Configuration node.
4. Replace the placeholder node with your business logic.
5. Test the workflow with valid and invalid requests to ensure it behaves as expected.

### Practice
Create a simple POST request to your webhook URL with and without the correct Bearer token and required fields. Observe how the workflow responds to each scenario, ensuring unauthorized or incomplete requests are handled correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you secure API endpoints, ensuring data integrity and security for your clients. This expertise can be a valuable service, attracting clients who need robust security solutions, thus generating income in the automation and API management space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Expose Webhook:** Map your external app to the listed path/method; test with curl/Postman before activation.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
