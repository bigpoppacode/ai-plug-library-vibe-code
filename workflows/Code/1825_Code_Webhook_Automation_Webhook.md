# Code Webhook Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×22, switch×4, if×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **API** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/docker-n8n`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "639", height: "909"
4. **Parametrs** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
6. **Container Stats** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
7. **Container Actions** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
8. **n8n** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
9. **If1** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **422-Invalid server domain** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "json", responseBody: "[{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "Invalid server domain"
}]"
11. **Inspect** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Stat** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Log** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Start** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Stop** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
16. **Mount Disk** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **Unmount Disk** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
18. **GET ACL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
19. **SET ACL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
20. **GET NET** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
21. **Version** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
22. **Users** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
23. **Change Password** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
24. **nginx** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
25. **Deploy-docker-compose** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
26. **Service Actions** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
27. **Test Connection1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
28. **Deploy** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
29. **Suspend** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
30. **Unsuspend** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
31. **Terminated** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
32. **ChangePackage** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
33. **SSH** `ssh` — cwd: "=/", command: "={{ $json.sh }}"
34. **Code1** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "try {
  if ($json.stdout === 'success') {
    return {
      json: {
        status: 'success',
        message: '',
        data: '',
      }
    };
  }

  const parsedData = JSON…[truncated]"
35. **API answer** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "allIncomingItems"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the management of Docker containers for a WHMCS/WISECP module. It triggers via a webhook, checks if the server domain is valid, and executes various container actions like starting, stopping, and managing disks. It also handles user management and version checks, providing automated responses for server operations.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer managing multiple client Docker containers could use this workflow to automate routine tasks like starting, stopping, and updating containers, ensuring efficient and error-free operations.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up webhook credentials for authentication.
3. Define your server domain and directories in the Parameters node.
4. Connect to a server with Docker installed using SSH credentials.
5. Test the workflow by sending a POST request to the webhook URL.

**Practice**  
Create a test Docker container and use the workflow to automate its startup and shutdown. Monitor the responses and logs to ensure the workflow performs as expected without manual intervention.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow equips you to offer automated Docker management services, reducing operational overhead and enhancing efficiency for businesses. This can attract clients seeking to streamline their server operations, potentially increasing your revenue through automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth, sshPassword.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
