# Code Noop Create Triggered
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute Workflow Trigger**.
  2. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` ‚Äî configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "5", width: "1316.8621045610755", height: "887.980239951363"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "216.6228464570463", height: "282.1449413577448"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "435.46822963832705", height: "327.68691689762716"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "216.6228464570463", height: "282.1449413577448"
7. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "216.6228464570463", height: "282.1449413577448", content: "## Update settings
Minimum requirement:
- Set your instanceBaseUrl"
8. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "216.6228464570463", height: "282.1449413577448"
9. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "216.6228464570463", height: "282.1449413577448", content: "## Setup Gmail
Minimum requirement:
- Update mail recipient"
10. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "657.2496253932529", height: "282.1449413577448"
11. **Start Reference** `noOp` ‚Äî configured for its default action.
12. **Settings** `set` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Get Workflow** `n8n` ‚Äî operation: **get**
14. **Modify Workflow (if required)** `code` ‚Äî mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "let symbol = $('Settings').item.json.symbol;
let onlyMajorChanges = $('Settings').item.json.onlyMajorChanges;
let addNodesToCanvas = $('Settings').item.json.addNodesToCanvas;

// c‚Ä¶[truncated]"
15. **Update Workflow** `n8n` ‚Äî operation: **update**
16. **Prepare Output** `set` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **Send Summary** `gmail` ‚Äî message: "=These workflows contain outdated nodes:<br>
<ul>
{{ $('Prepare Output').all().pluck('json').pluck('name').map(item => "<li>"+item+"</li>").join('') }}
</ul>", options: "[object Object]", subject: "Outdated n8n Workflow Nodes"
  
  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to check for outdated nodes in other workflows. It retrieves workflows, identifies nodes that are not up to date, and updates them if necessary. It then prepares a summary of these outdated nodes and sends an email notification listing them, ensuring all workflows are running the latest versions of nodes.

**Demonstrate:** A developer maintaining multiple automated workflows can use this to ensure all workflows use the latest node versions, preventing potential issues from outdated implementations.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your n8n and Gmail accounts.
3. Set the `instanceBaseUrl` in the Settings node.
4. Ensure your workflows are linked properly.
5. Test by executing the workflow to receive an email summary of outdated nodes.

**Practice:** Create a test workflow with outdated nodes. Run this workflow to see how it identifies and reports them. Experiment by updating nodes and running it again to see the changes.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow helps ensure your automations are always up-to-date and reliable, enhancing your service offerings. This can increase client trust, reduce maintenance time, and open opportunities for offering workflow optimization services.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, n8nApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
