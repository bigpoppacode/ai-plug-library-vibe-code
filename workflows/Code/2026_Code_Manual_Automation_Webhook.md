# Code Manual Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×3, noOp×2, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **ManualTrigger**.
  2. **ManualTrigger** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "180", height: "360", content: "## Settings"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "720", height: "360"
5. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "340", height: "360"
6. **Settings** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
7. **PrepareXML** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "[redacted]"
8. **PostRequest** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://{{ $('Settings').item.json.wordpressUrl }}/xmlrpc.php`
9. **HandleResponse** `xml` — options: "[object Object]"
10. **IsSuccessful** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]", looseTypeValidation: "true"
11. **Success** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
12. **Error** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of posting content to a WordPress.com blog using XML-RPC. It starts with a manual trigger, sets the necessary parameters like blog URL, username, and password, and then prepares an XML payload with the post content. The HTTP Request node sends this payload to the WordPress XML-RPC endpoint. The workflow checks if the post request was successful and routes the process accordingly, logging a success or error.
  
- **Demonstrate:** A blogger or business can use this workflow to automate posting updates to their WordPress blog, saving time on manual uploads and ensuring consistent posting schedules.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n, configure the 'Settings' node with your WordPress credentials and blog details, and customize the content fields. Test the workflow by running the manual trigger to ensure it posts successfully to your blog.

- **Practice:** Set up a dummy WordPress account, use the workflow to post a test article, and verify the post appears on your blog. Modify the content fields and observe how changes reflect in the blog post.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated content management services to clients, boosting their online presence effortlessly. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient blog management solutions, potentially increasing your revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
