# Code Schedule Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "200", content: "## 📝 Description

Automatically turn YouTube videos into clear, structured content ideas stored in Airtable. This workflow pulls new video links from Airtable, extracts transcript…[truncated]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "220", content: "## ⚙️ What It Does
- **Scans** Airtable for new YouTube video links every 5 minutes..
- **Extracts** the transcript of the video using a third-party API via RapidAPI.
- **Summarize…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "500", height: "460", content: "[redacted]"
6. **Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **search**, table: `[object Object]`
7. **Get Video ID** `code` — jsCode: "// Loop over input items
for (const item of $input.all()) {
    // Extract the YouTube video ID using a regular expression
    const Source = item.json.Source;
    const videoIdMat…[truncated]"
8. **Get video transcript** `httpRequest` — url: `https://youtube-video-summarizer-gpt-ai.p.rapidapi.com/api/v1/get-transcript-v2`
9. **Get All Transcripts** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Combine Transcripts** `code` — jsCode: "// Initialize an empty string to hold the concatenated transcript
let Transcript = "";

// Safeguard against undefined paths and ensure required properties exist
if ($json.data && …[truncated]"
11. **Get Full Transcript** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Extract detailed summary** `informationExtractor` — text: "=Your job is to generate detailed summary of "{{ $json.Transcript }}".

Always output your answer in the following format:

- Main Idea
- Takeaways", options: "[object Object]", schemaType: "fromJson"
13. **Get Main Idea & Key Takeaways** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
14. **Update Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **update**, table: `[object Object]`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting YouTube videos into structured content ideas stored in Airtable. It checks Airtable every 5 minutes for new YouTube video links, extracts the video transcript using RapidAPI, summarizes the content to outline the main idea and key takeaways, and updates the Airtable record with these insights, marking the task as completed.

**Demonstrate:**  
A content creator might use this workflow to streamline content ideation by automatically generating summaries and key points from YouTube videos, saving time on manual research and enhancing content planning.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and RapidAPI accounts.
3. Configure the Airtable node with your table and base.
4. Set up RapidAPI with your API key.
5. Test and activate the workflow to start automating.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Airtable table with a few YouTube video links. Run the workflow to see how it extracts and summarizes the content, updating the table with the main idea and takeaways. Adjust video links and observe changes.

**WIIFM:**  
Learning this workflow can help you offer content automation services, making content creation more efficient for clients. This can increase your service offerings, attract more clients, and boost income in an AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableTokenApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
