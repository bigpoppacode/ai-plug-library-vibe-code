# Code Schedule Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, httpRequest×2, manualTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "615", height: "289"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "224.51612903225822", height: "461.4193548387107", content: "[redacted]"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "225.99936321742769", height: "508.95792207792226"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "331.32883116883124", height: "474.88"
8. **Get data from Matomo** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://shrewd-lyrebird.pikapod.net/index.php`
9. **Parse data from Matomo** `code` — jsCode: "// Get input data
const items = $input.all();

// Format the visitor data into a clear prompt
const visitorData = items.map(item => {
  const visit = item.json;
  
  const visitorA…[truncated]"
10. **Send data to A.I. for analysis** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
11. **Store results in Baserow** `baserow` — operation: **create**, table: `643`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow retrieves visitor data from Matomo Analytics for users who have visited a site more than three times in the last 30 days. It formats this data into a prompt and sends it to an AI service for analysis, requesting insights on visitor behavior and SEO improvement suggestions. The AI's analysis is then stored in Baserow.

**Demonstrate:**  
A digital marketing consultant could use this workflow to analyze website traffic patterns and generate actionable SEO insights, helping businesses optimize their online presence.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Matomo, Openrouter AI, and Baserow accounts.  
3. Configure your Matomo API key and Baserow table ID.  
4. Set up the schedule trigger according to your needs.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it processes data correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Matomo site and simulate visitor data. Run the workflow to see how the AI analyzes and stores the results. Adjust the AI prompt for more specific insights.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can enable you to offer advanced analytics and SEO optimization services, enhancing your value proposition to clients and potentially increasing your earnings through data-driven marketing strategies.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, baserowApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
