# Code Respondtowebhook Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, webhook, set.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note4**.
  2. **Receive Vectors** `webhook` — path: `/centroid`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "620", height: "420"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "700", height: "500"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "680", height: "420"
6. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "840", height: "420"
7. **Extract & Parse Vectors** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Validate & Compute Centroid** `code` — jsCode: "const input = items[0].json;
const vectors = input.vectors;

if (!Array.isArray(vectors) || vectors.length === 0) {
  return [{ json: { error: "Invalid input: Expected an array of …[truncated]"
9. **Return Centroid Response** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow in n8n automatically calculates the centroid of a set of vectors sent via a webhook. It receives vector data through a GET request, validates the data to ensure all vectors are of the same dimension, computes the centroid by averaging each dimension, and then responds with the centroid coordinates or an error message if the input is invalid.

### Demonstrate
A data analyst might use this workflow to automatically calculate the centroid of data points from a sensor network. This can help in identifying the central point of activity, which is useful in various applications like tracking wildlife or monitoring environmental changes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive vectors as a GET request.
3. Ensure vectors are sent in JSON format through the webhook URL.
4. Verify the workflow correctly parses and computes the centroid.
5. Customize the response node to fit your specific application needs.

### Practice
Create a test case by sending a GET request to the webhook URL with a set of 3D vectors. Observe the workflow's response. Modify the vector dimensions or contents to see how validation and computation handle different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow equips you to offer automated data processing services, such as geographic data analysis, to clients. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract data-driven businesses, and generate additional income streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
