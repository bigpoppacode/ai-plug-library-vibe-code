# Code Schedule Export Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stickyNote×7, github×3, if×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Workflow changes committed to the repository"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Check if there are any changes in the workflow"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Create a new file for the workflow"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Check if file exists in the repository"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Convert the file contents to JSON string"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Get all workflows"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — height: "80", content: "Set variables"
10. **Globals** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up workflows to a GitHub repository. It triggers at scheduled intervals, retrieves all workflows, checks if they exist in the repository, and either creates new files or updates existing ones with the latest workflow data in JSON format. The workflow ensures that your automation processes are consistently backed up and version-controlled in GitHub.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer might use this workflow to ensure that all their n8n workflows are regularly backed up to GitHub, preventing data loss and allowing easy version tracking for collaborative projects.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your GitHub account.  
3. Set the repository details in the "Globals" node.  
4. Configure the schedule for backups in the "Schedule Trigger" node.  
5. Test the workflow to confirm it correctly backs up workflows to GitHub.

**Practice:**  
Create a test repository on GitHub and run the workflow to back up a simple n8n workflow. Check the repository to see the JSON file created or updated. Modify a workflow and rerun the backup to see the changes reflected in GitHub.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer backup and version control services to clients, ensuring their automations are secure and up-to-date. This adds reliability to your service offerings, potentially increasing client trust and retention in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** githubApi, n8nApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
