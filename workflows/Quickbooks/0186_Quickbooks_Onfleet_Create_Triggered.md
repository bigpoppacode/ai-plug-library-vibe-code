This n8n workflow automatically creates an invoice in QuickBooks Online whenever a new task is created in Onfleet. It starts with an Onfleet trigger that activates when a new delivery task is created. The workflow then uses the QuickBooks Online node to generate an invoice, streamlining the billing process and ensuring that each delivery task is promptly invoiced without manual intervention.

2. Connect your Onfleet and QuickBooks Online accounts.
3. Set the Onfleet trigger to activate on new task creation.
4. Customize the QuickBooks Online invoice fields as needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure invoices are created correctly.

### Practice

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
