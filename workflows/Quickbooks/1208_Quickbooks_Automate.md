### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating and sending invoices using QuickBooks. It first creates a customer in QuickBooks, then generates an invoice for a consulting service with a specified amount. Finally, it sends this invoice to the customer's email, streamlining the invoicing process and ensuring prompt delivery.

### Demonstrate
A freelance consultant could use this workflow to automate invoicing clients after each project completion, ensuring they are promptly billed and reducing the time spent on manual invoice creation and management.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your QuickBooks account with OAuth credentials.
3. Customize the customer details and invoice information.
4. Run the workflow to test the invoice creation and sending process.
5. Adjust parameters as needed for your specific use case.

### Practice
Create a test customer in QuickBooks and run the workflow with a small invoice amount. Verify that the invoice is correctly created and sent to the test customer's email, ensuring all steps are functioning as intended.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your billing efficiency, reducing time spent on invoicing and improving cash flow. Offering automated invoicing services can attract clients looking for streamlined financial operations, expanding your business opportunities in the AI automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
