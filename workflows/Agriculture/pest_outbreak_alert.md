# Pest Outbreak Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Pest Outbreak Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/pest_outbreak_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "pest_outbreak_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "pest_outbreak_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to manage and respond to pest outbreak alerts. It starts with a Webhook that receives POST requests containing alert data. This data is processed into embeddings using Cohere, stored in Pinecone for efficient retrieval, and then queried for insights. The findings are enriched by an AI agent using OpenAI, and the results are logged in a Google Sheet for record-keeping and further action.

### Demonstrate
A municipality could use this workflow to automatically log and respond to pest outbreak reports from local farmers. This ensures timely action and data-driven decision-making to mitigate the impact on agriculture.

### Imitate
1. Set up the webhook in n8n to receive pest alert data.
2. Connect your Pinecone and OpenAI accounts.
3. Configure the Google Sheets node with your sheet ID.
4. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a test alert with data like pest type and location, and run the workflow. Check the Google Sheet to ensure the alert data is logged and see how the AI enriches the information.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer pest management solutions to agricultural businesses, providing them with timely insights and actions. This can enhance your service offerings and increase your value as an automation consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, pineconeApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
