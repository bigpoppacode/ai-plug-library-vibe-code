# Soil Nutrient Analysis
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Soil Nutrient Analysis", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/soil_nutrient_analysis`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "soil_nutrient_analysis"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "soil_nutrient_analysis"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of analyzing soil nutrient data. It begins by receiving data through a Webhook, which is then split into manageable chunks. The chunks are processed to create embeddings using Hugging Face, which are then stored in a Weaviate vector database. The workflow queries the database for relevant information, processes it using AI, and logs the results into a Google Sheet for easy access and further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A farmer could use this workflow to automatically analyze soil samples sent from various fields. By storing and querying data in a vector database, the farmer can quickly access insights about soil conditions, leading to informed decisions about fertilization and crop rotation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Webhook, Hugging Face, Weaviate, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Configure the Webhook to receive soil data.
4. Customize the Google Sheet to log relevant findings.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it processes and logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a sample dataset of soil nutrient information. Run the workflow to see how it processes the data and logs it into Google Sheets. Experiment with different data inputs to observe changes in the analysis results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data analysis services, providing valuable insights for agriculture, environmental research, and more. This capability can attract clients seeking efficient data management and decision-making tools, enhancing your service portfolio and income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
