# Harvest Logbook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Harvest Logbook", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/harvest_logbook`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "harvest_logbook"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "harvest_logbook"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to handle and process incoming data through a webhook. It receives data, splits it into manageable chunks, and creates embeddings using OpenAI. The embeddings are then stored in a Pinecone vector database. The workflow also queries this database to retrieve relevant information and uses an AI agent to define and process the data. Finally, the processed information is appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate:** A developer might use this workflow to automate the process of logging and analyzing customer feedback. By storing feedback as vector embeddings, the business can later query this data to identify trends or specific customer sentiments.

**Imitate:** To apply this workflow, import it into your n8n environment. Set up the webhook to receive data from your source. Configure Pinecone and OpenAI credentials. Customize the Google Sheet setup to match your data needs. Test to ensure data flows correctly from the webhook to the sheet.

**Practice:** Create a test webhook and send sample data through it. Observe how the workflow processes this data, stores embeddings, and updates your Google Sheet. Experiment by querying the vector database to see how it retrieves information.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently handle and analyze large datasets, such as customer feedback, in an automated and scalable way. This expertise can help you offer advanced data processing services to clients, enhancing your AI automation business capabilities and attracting more customers.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
