# Weather Impact Report
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Weather Impact Report", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/weather_impact_report`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "weather_impact_report"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "weather_impact_report"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow is designed to create a "Weather Impact Report" by processing data through various steps. It begins with a Webhook that receives data, then splits and processes it using text embeddings. The data is stored and queried in a Supabase vector store. An AI agent compiles and analyzes the data, and the results are appended to a Google Sheet. This can be used to assess how weather impacts certain parameters by leveraging AI and data storage solutions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to analyze the impact of weather on sales. By feeding in weather data and sales figures, the workflow can generate insights, helping businesses adjust strategies based on weather patterns.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook to receive data.
3. Connect to Supabase and configure the vector store.
4. Set up the AI agent with your specific analysis needs.
5. Configure Google Sheets to log results.
6. Test with sample data for accuracy.

### Practice
Create a mock dataset with weather variables and hypothetical sales numbers. Run the workflow to see how different weather conditions might affect sales, refining the AI agent's prompts to improve analysis.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer data-driven insights as a service, helping businesses optimize their operations based on weather data. This can expand your service offerings and increase revenue as a consultant in the AI automation space.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
