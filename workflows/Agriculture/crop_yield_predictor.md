# Crop Yield Predictor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Crop Yield Predictor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/crop_yield_predictor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "crop_yield_predictor"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "crop_yield_predictor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
The "Crop Yield Predictor" workflow in n8n uses AI to predict crop yields. It starts with a Webhook node that receives data, which is then processed and transformed into embeddings using Hugging Face. The data is stored and queried in a vector database (Supabase). An AI agent uses this data to generate predictions, which are logged in Google Sheets for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate**  
A farm consultancy might use this workflow to predict crop yields for clients. By automating data processing and prediction, they can provide fast, data-driven insights to help farmers optimize their production strategies.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Supabase and Google Sheets accounts.  
3. Configure the Webhook to receive your crop data.  
4. Test the workflow with sample data to see predictions logged in Google Sheets.

**Practice**  
Create a mock dataset of crop factors (e.g., weather, soil quality) in Google Sheets. Run the workflow to see how it processes the data and logs predictions. Adjust input data to observe changes in predictions.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer predictive analytics services to agricultural clients, enhancing decision-making capabilities and potentially increasing crop yields. This expertise can position you as a valuable partner in the agricultural tech industry, opening new revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, supabaseApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
