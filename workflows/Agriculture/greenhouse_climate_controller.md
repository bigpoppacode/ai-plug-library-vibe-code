# Greenhouse Climate Controller
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Greenhouse Climate Controller", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/greenhouse_climate_controller`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "greenhouse_climate_controller"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "greenhouse_climate_controller"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
The "Greenhouse Climate Controller" workflow in n8n automates the process of managing climate data for a greenhouse. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, processes the data by splitting and embedding it, and then stores this information in a Pinecone vector database. The workflow queries the database, uses an AI agent to generate insights, and logs results in Google Sheets, enabling efficient climate monitoring and adjustments.

**Demonstrate**  
A greenhouse manager could use this workflow to automate the monitoring of climate conditions, ensuring optimal plant growth by adjusting environmental factors based on real-time data analysis.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Pinecone and Google Sheets accounts.  
3. Set up a webhook to receive climate data.  
4. Configure the vector database and AI agent for processing.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it logs and processes data correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a simple n8n workflow that receives temperature and humidity data via a webhook, logs it in Google Sheets, and sends an alert if conditions are outside a specified range.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer advanced automation solutions for agriculture, improving operational efficiency and potentially increasing crop yields. This skill can be marketed to clients as a valuable service, expanding your automation business offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, pineconeApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
