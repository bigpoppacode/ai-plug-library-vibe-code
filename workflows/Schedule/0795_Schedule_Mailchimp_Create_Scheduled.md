# Schedule Mailchimp Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "371.1995072042308", height: "600.88409546716"
5. **Squarespace newsletter submissions** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of transferring newsletter signups from a Google Sheet (populated by Squarespace) to Mailchimp. It retrieves email addresses and relevant data from the sheet and adds each new signup to a specified Mailchimp audience as a contact, enabling seamless email marketing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner using Squarespace for website forms can use this workflow to automatically add newsletter signups to their Mailchimp list, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring timely communication with new subscribers.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Google Sheets and Mailchimp accounts.
3. Set up a trigger (manual or scheduled).
4. Link to your Google Sheet and Mailchimp audience.
5. Test the workflow to ensure contacts are added correctly.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with mock email signups, then run the workflow. Verify that the entries are added to your Mailchimp audience. Adjust sheet columns or Mailchimp fields if needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data transfer services, saving clients time and reducing errors. This enhances your service offerings and can lead to additional income through upsells in automation and email marketing services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, mailchimpApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
