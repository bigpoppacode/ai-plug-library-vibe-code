# Schedule Slack Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — height: "260", content: "[redacted]"
4. **If Working Hours** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]", looseTypeValidation: "true"
5. **Assign parameters** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **Query For Upwork Job Posts** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/arlusm~upwork-scraper-with-fresh-job-posts/run-sync-get-dataset-items`
7. **Find Existing Entries** `mongoDb` — collection: `n8n`
8. **Output New Entries** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", joinMode: "keepNonMatches"
9. **Add New Entries To MongoDB** `mongoDb` — operation: **insert**, collection: `n8n`
10. **Send message in #general** `slack` — text: "=Job Title : {{ $json.title }}
Published : {{ $json.publishedDate }}
Link : {{ $json.link }}
Payment Type: {{ $json.paymentType }}
Budget: {{ $json.budget }}
Skills: {{ $json.skill…[truncated]", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching and notifying about new job posts from Upwork. It runs every 10 minutes during working hours, queries Upwork for job posts related to specified skills, checks if they already exist in a MongoDB database, and if not, adds them to the database. New entries are then sent to a Slack channel for team visibility.

### Demonstrate
A freelance agency could use this workflow to stay updated on new job opportunities on Upwork. By automatically fetching and notifying about relevant job posts, the agency can quickly respond to potential projects, increasing their chances of securing work.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up MongoDB and Slack credentials.
3. Modify the "Assign parameters" node to include specific Upwork URLs.
4. Schedule the workflow to run during your working hours.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it fetches and notifies correctly.

### Practice
Create a test MongoDB collection and Slack channel. Run the workflow with test URLs to see how it fetches job posts and sends notifications. Modify the collection or Slack channel to see how changes affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide a valuable service to freelancers or agencies, enhancing their job hunting efficiency. Offering such automation can expand your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase revenue as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpQueryAuth, mongoDb, slackApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
