# Schedule Slack Monitor Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Trigger daily** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Define relevant products** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
4. **Look up products** `airtop` — resource: **extraction**, operation: **query**, url: `https://www.producthunt.com/`, prompt: "=Extract up to 5 product launches that are {{ $json["Relevant Products"] }} for each product extract the title and URL (if exists).

Return format:
Today's [{{ $json["Relevant Prod…[truncated]"
5. **Found products?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
6. **Send slack message** `slack` — text: "={{ $json.data.modelResponse }}", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates daily monitoring of Product Hunt for new product launches related to "AI Agents". It starts every day at 6 AM, checks Product Hunt for up to 5 relevant products, and if products are found, it sends their details (title and URL) to a specified Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A startup tracking competitor product launches could use this workflow to stay updated on new AI tools, enabling them to quickly strategize marketing or product development responses.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the schedule trigger for daily execution.
3. Enter your specific product interest in the "Define relevant products" node.
4. Connect your Slack channel in the "Send slack message" node.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends updates correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Slack channel and run the workflow using a mock product category to see how it behaves. Modify the product category to test different results and ensure the Slack message formatting is clear.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer competitive intelligence services, giving clients timely insights into market trends. This expertise can enhance your offerings as an automation consultant, attract new clients, and increase revenue through high-value services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** airtopApi, slackApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
