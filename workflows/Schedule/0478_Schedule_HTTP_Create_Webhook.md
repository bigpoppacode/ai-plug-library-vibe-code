# Schedule HTTP Create Webhook
## üöÄ What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## üíº Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` ‚Äî rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Monitor Zalando Product** `formTrigger` ‚Äî path: `/6da9a655-b46b-454d-bb96-32e203627a20`
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", width: "275.01592825011585", height: "439.37809705210145"
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", width: "275.01592825011585", height: "93.37809705210145"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", width: "275.01592825011585", height: "136.37809705210145"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "202.64787116404852", height: "85.79488430601403"
8. **Add Product** `googleSheets` ‚Äî operation: **appendOrUpdate**
9. **List Products** `googleSheets` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
10. **Scrap Product** `httpRequest` ‚Äî url: `={{ $json.link }}`
11. **Format Product** `set` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Add Log in History** `googleSheets` ‚Äî operation: **appendOrUpdate**
13. **Update Products Infos** `googleSheets` ‚Äî operation: **update**
14. **If price below price alert** `if` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
15. **Notify Price Reduction** `gmail` ‚Äî sendTo: "n8n.ninja@gmail.com", message: "=<h3>Price reduction alert for {{ $('Format Product').item.json["name"] }}</h3>

<p>New price {{ $('Format Product').item.json["price"] }} CHF is bellow {{ $('List Products').item.‚Ä¶[truncated]", options: "[object Object]"

## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This n8n workflow monitors Zalando products for price changes. It starts with a scheduled trigger or a form submission to add a product to a Google Sheet. The workflow scrapes product data from the provided link, formats it, and logs it in a history sheet. If a product's price falls below a predefined alert threshold, an email notification is sent to the user.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner can use this workflow to track competitor prices on Zalando, ensuring they can adjust their pricing strategy in real time and capitalize on price drops.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your Google Sheets and Gmail accounts. 3. Set up the form to add products with price alerts. 4. Schedule the trigger or manually add products to monitor. 5. Test the workflow to ensure it notifies you of price changes.

**Practice:** Create a test Google Sheet with a few Zalando product links and price alert thresholds. Run the workflow and observe how it updates the sheet and sends notifications based on price changes.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated price monitoring services to clients, helping them stay competitive in the market. This can lead to increased customer acquisition and retention, boosting your income in the AI automation business.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
