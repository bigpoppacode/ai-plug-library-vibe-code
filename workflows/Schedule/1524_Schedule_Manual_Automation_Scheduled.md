# Schedule Manual Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, httpRequest×2, manualTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **retry workflow automatically** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ 

$('login_details').item.json.n8n_instance.endsWith('/') 
  ? $('login_details').item.json.n8n_instance + 'rest/executions/' + $json.id + '/retry' 
  : $('login_details').item…[truncated]`
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "383.5091496232509", height: "285.0376749192681", content: "- ## check for failed executions hourly.
- ## filter out those that have successful reexecution ids.
- ## log into n8n and get the session ids.
- ## retry the executions.

"
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "349.5813953488373", height: "278.232558139535"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "343.81395348837225", height: "263.8139534883721"
8. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "444.7441860465116", height: "268.139534883721"
9. **login_details** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Log into n8n** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ 

(() => {
  const instance = $json.n8n_instance;
  const normalizedUrl = instance.endsWith('/') ? instance + 'rest/login' : instance + '/rest/login';
  return normalizedUrl;
}…[truncated]`
11. **n8n** `n8n` — resource: **execution**
12. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **No Operation, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
14. **Loop Over Items** `splitInBatches` — options: "[object Object]", batchSize: "5"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically retries failed executions in an n8n instance. It logs into the n8n instance, checks for failed executions every hour, filters out those that have already been retried successfully, and attempts to retry the failed executions. This helps ensure that workflows run smoothly without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to ensure that critical automations, like order processing or customer notifications, are retried automatically if they fail, reducing downtime and maintaining operational efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.
2. Set up your n8n instance URL, username, and password in the login details node.
3. Schedule the workflow to run hourly.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it retries failed executions as expected.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that deliberately fails (e.g., an HTTP request to an invalid URL). Use the retry workflow to automatically attempt to resolve the failure, refining your understanding of error handling in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you minimize downtime and maintain client satisfaction by ensuring that critical automations are retried automatically. This reliability can be a key selling point for your automation services, leading to increased client trust and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
