# Schedule Spotify Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using spotify×4, stickyNote×3, scheduleTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **CRON** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "262", height: "354"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "634", height: "190"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "605.1751740139206", height: "733.4280742459401"
6. **Get User's Playlists** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**, operation: **getUserPlaylists**
7. **Switch** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", value1: "={{ $json.name }}", dataType: "string"
8. **Get Discover Tracks** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**, operation: **getTracks**
9. **Get Archive Tracks** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**, operation: **getTracks**
10. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", joinMode: "keepNonMatches"
11. **Check if tracks to add is NOT empty** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **Add tracks to Archive playlist** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automatically archives your Spotify Discover Weekly playlist to another playlist every Monday at 8:30 AM. It retrieves your playlists, identifies the Discover Weekly and Archive playlists, compares tracks to ensure only unique songs are added to the Archive, and updates the Archive playlist with new tracks.

**Demonstrate:**  
A music enthusiast could use this workflow to save their Discover Weekly playlist each week, ensuring they don't lose any favorite tracks when the playlist updates. This helps in building a comprehensive music collection over time.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Create a new Spotify playlist for archiving.  
3. Set up Spotify credentials in n8n.  
4. Modify the Switch node to match your playlist names if different.  
5. Activate the workflow to run automatically.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Spotify account and playlists. Run the workflow and check if new tracks from Discover Weekly are correctly added to the Archive playlist. Adjust the playlist names in the Switch node to see how it affects the workflow.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows students to offer personalized playlist management services to music lovers. It can be a unique selling point for an AI automation business, attracting clients who want to enhance their Spotify experience without manual effort.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** spotifyOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
