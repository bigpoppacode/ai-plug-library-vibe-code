# Schedule HTTP Monitor Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "560", height: "540", content: "📘 Node Descriptions for Your Web Server Monitor Workflow

⏰ 1. Schedule Trigger  
Triggers the workflow every minute to initiate regular checks on server availability.

📄 2. Web …[truncated]"
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Server-Monitor** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
5. **HTTP Request** `httpRequest` — url: `=http://{{ $json.Server }}`
6. **Server_Status_Alive** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
7. **Gmail** `gmail` — message: "=Hi Team,

At {{$now.format('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')}}, the following server failed to respond to ping:

🔻 Server Down: {{ $json["Server"] }}  

Please investigate immediately to pr…[truncated]", options: "[object Object]", subject: "=🔻 Server Down: {{ $json["Server"] }}: {{ $today.format('yyyy-MM-dd') }}"
8. **Server_Status_Down** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This workflow is designed to monitor the availability of web servers. It triggers every minute, retrieves a list of server IPs from Google Sheets, checks each server's status via HTTP requests, logs successful checks, and sends email alerts if a server is down. All results are logged back into Google Sheets for record-keeping.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner uses this workflow to ensure their website is always up and running. If a server goes down, they are immediately notified, allowing for quick response and minimizing downtime, which is critical for maintaining customer trust and revenue.

- **Imitate:** To apply this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your Google Sheets and Gmail accounts, configure the Google Sheets document with your server list, and set the Gmail node to send alerts to your team. Test the workflow to ensure alerts and logs work as expected.

- **Practice:** Create a Google Sheet with a few dummy server IPs. Run the workflow and observe how it logs successful checks and sends alerts for servers marked as "down." Modify server statuses to see how the workflow reacts.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer server monitoring services to clients, ensuring their online services are reliable. This can lead to increased trust and retention, as well as potential upsells to more comprehensive IT monitoring packages, thereby generating additional income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
