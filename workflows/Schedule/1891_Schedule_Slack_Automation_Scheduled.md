# Schedule Slack Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "217.47708894878716", height: "233"
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "223.7196765498655", height: "236.66152029520293"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "561", height: "360"
5. **Google Calendar - Get Events** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **getAll**
6. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "221.73584905660368", height: "233"
8. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
9. **Calendar AI Agent** `agent` — text: "=summarize today's meetings.
startdate = {{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00') }}
enddate = {{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd 23:59:59') }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
10. **Send response back to slack channel** `slack` — text: "=Gemini : {{ $json.output.removeMarkdown() }} ", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically summarizes daily meetings from a Google Calendar and sends the summary to a Slack channel. It triggers every day at 9 AM, retrieves all events for the day, uses the Google Gemini AI model to generate a summary, and posts it in a Slack channel. This automation helps keep teams informed about their daily schedules without manually checking the calendar.

### Demonstrate
A team leader could use this workflow to keep team members updated on daily meetings, ensuring everyone is aware of their schedules and can prepare accordingly. It streamlines communication and enhances productivity by reducing the need for manual updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google Calendar and Slack credentials.
3. Modify the Slack channel ID to target your desired channel.
4. Schedule the trigger to run at your preferred time.
5. Test the workflow to ensure the meeting summaries are accurately posted to Slack.

### Practice
Create a test Google Calendar with dummy events. Run the workflow to see how it summarizes and posts the events to a Slack channel. Adjust the event details and re-run the test to observe changes in the summary.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated scheduling solutions, helping clients stay organized and informed. This can enhance client productivity, improve team communication, and open opportunities for providing additional automation services, boosting your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, googleCalendarOAuth2Api, googlePalmApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
