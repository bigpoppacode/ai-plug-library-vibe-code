# Schedule Notion Sync Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **On schedule** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Get all tasks with specific label** `todoist` — operation: **getAll**
4. **Add to Notion database** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**
5. **Replace label on task** `todoist` — operation: **update**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the synchronization of tasks from Todoist to Notion. It runs on a set schedule, retrieves tasks with a specific label from Todoist, adds them to a Notion database, and then updates the Todoist tasks to reflect that they've been processed by changing their label and adding a Notion link.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to ensure that all tasks marked for review are collected in a Notion database for team visibility, enabling centralized task management and collaboration.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Todoist and Notion accounts.
3. Set up the schedule to trigger the workflow.
4. Define the specific label in Todoist and configure the Notion database.
5. Test the workflow to ensure tasks are correctly moved and labeled.

### Practice
Create a test label in Todoist and assign it to a few tasks. Run the workflow and verify that these tasks appear in your Notion database and have their labels updated in Todoist.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer task synchronization solutions, enhancing productivity and organization for clients. This expertise can attract businesses seeking seamless task management, opening opportunities for consulting and service upsells.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** todoistOAuth2Api, notionApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
