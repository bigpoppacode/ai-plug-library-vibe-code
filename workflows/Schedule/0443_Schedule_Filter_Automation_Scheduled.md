# Schedule Filter Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "379", height: "80"
3. **At midnight every work day** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "202", height: "100"
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "202", height: "100"
6. **Get all emails in the last day** `gmail` — resource: **thread**
7. **Get the thread of each email** `gmail` — resource: **thread**, operation: **get**
8. **Keep only starred emails in inbox** `filter` — conditions: "[object Object]"
9. **Archive thread  (remove from inbox)** `gmail` — resource: **thread**, operation: **removeLabels**
10. **for each message in the thread** `itemLists` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "messages"
11. **Archive message (remove from inbox)** `gmail` — operation: **removeLabels**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automatically manages your Gmail inbox every workday at midnight. It retrieves all emails from the last day, checks if they are starred, and archives those that are not starred. This helps keep your inbox clean by retaining only important emails.

**Demonstrate:**  
A busy professional could use this workflow to keep their inbox organized by automatically archiving non-important emails, ensuring that only crucial messages remain visible for immediate attention.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail account.
3. Schedule the trigger to run at midnight.
4. Test the workflow by starring some emails and observing how others are archived.
5. Customize the workflow to fit personal or work email needs.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Gmail account and send a few emails to it. Use the workflow to process these emails, starring some manually, and observe how the workflow archives the non-starred ones.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer email management solutions to clients, enhancing their productivity. This can be a valuable service in an automation business, leading to increased customer satisfaction and potential revenue growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
