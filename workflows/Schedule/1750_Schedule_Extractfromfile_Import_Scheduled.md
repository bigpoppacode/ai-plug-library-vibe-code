# Schedule Extractfromfile Import Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using googleDrive×3, extractFromFile×3, documentDefaultDataLoader.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **Default Data Loader** `documentDefaultDataLoader` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Recursive Character Text Splitter** `textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` — options: "[object Object]", chunkOverlap: "50"
4. **Embeddings OpenAI** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
5. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
6. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "380", height: "240"
8. **Search Folder** `googleDrive` — resource: **fileFolder**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of loading and processing files from Google Drive into a vector database. It searches for files in a specified Google Drive folder, downloads them, and processes their content using OpenAI embeddings to generate vector representations. These vectors are then stored in a PostgreSQL database with PGVector, enabling semantic search and retrieval capabilities.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to manage and query large document datasets. For instance, a company might want to index all their PDFs and text files into a vector database to enable advanced search capabilities, such as finding documents by their semantic content rather than just keywords.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Drive and PostgreSQL accounts.
3. Set up a scheduled trigger to run the workflow at a desired interval.
4. Customize the Google Drive folder path and PostgreSQL table details.
5. Test the workflow to ensure files are processed and indexed correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Google Drive folder with a few text and PDF files. Run the workflow to observe how files are processed and indexed in the PostgreSQL database. Experiment by querying the database to see if you can retrieve documents based on semantic content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer advanced data indexing and retrieval solutions to clients, enhancing their data accessibility and search capabilities. This can open up new revenue streams and increase the value you provide as a part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres, googleDriveOAuth2Api.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
