# Schedule Youtube Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, twitter, openAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "221.82716049382665", height: "308.7901234567902"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "244.34567901234558", height: "102.81481481481477", content: "**Use AI to Promote Your New YouTube Videos on X**

🎬 Watch the [Setup Video Here](https://mrc.fm/ai2x)"
4. **Check Every 30 Min** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Fetch Latest Videos** `youTube` — resource: **video**
6. **Generate Post for X with ChatGPT** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
7. **Post to X** `twitter` — text: "={{ $json.message.content }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the promotion of new YouTube videos on X (formerly Twitter). Every 30 minutes, it checks for new videos on a specified YouTube channel. If a new video is found, it uses ChatGPT to generate a short, engaging tweet about the video, including a link, title, and description. The generated tweet is then automatically posted to X, helping to promote the video to a wider audience without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A content creator could use this workflow to automatically promote their latest YouTube videos on X, ensuring timely and consistent engagement with their audience, thereby increasing views and subscriber count.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your YouTube and X accounts.
3. Set your YouTube Channel ID in the Fetch Latest Videos node.
4. Customize the tweet content in the ChatGPT node if needed.
5. Activate the workflow to start automatic posting.

### Practice
Create a test YouTube channel and upload a video. Run the workflow to see how it fetches the video and posts a promotional tweet. Adjust the content and schedule as needed to understand the process better.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated social media promotion services, enhancing your clients' online presence. This can lead to increased engagement, higher video views, and potential monetization opportunities, boosting your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** twitterOAuth2Api, openAiApi, youTubeOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
