# Schedule Slack Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "217.47708894878716", height: "233"
3. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "223.7196765498655", height: "236.66152029520293"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "561", height: "360"
5. **Google Calendar - Get Events** `googleCalendarTool` — operation: **getAll**
6. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "221.73584905660368", height: "233"
8. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
9. **Calendar AI Agent** `agent` — text: "=summarize today's meetings.
startdate = {{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd 00:00:00') }}
enddate = {{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd 23:59:59') }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
10. **Send response back to slack channel** `slack` — text: "=Gemini : {{ $json.output.removeMarkdown() }} ", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing daily meetings from Google Calendar and sending the summary to a Slack channel. It triggers daily at 9 AM, retrieves all events for the day, uses the Google Gemini Chat Model to summarize the meetings, and sends the summary back to a designated Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to get a daily overview of their meetings sent directly to their Slack, ensuring they stay informed and organized without manually checking their calendar.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Calendar and Slack accounts.
3. Set the Schedule Trigger to your preferred time.
4. Customize the Slack channel and message format if needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it functions as expected.

### Practice
Create a test Google Calendar with events for today. Run the workflow and observe how it retrieves and summarizes the events, then sends the summary to your Slack channel. Adjust event details to see how the summary changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated meeting summaries to clients, enhancing their productivity and communication. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and potential upsells in your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, googleCalendarOAuth2Api, googlePalmApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
