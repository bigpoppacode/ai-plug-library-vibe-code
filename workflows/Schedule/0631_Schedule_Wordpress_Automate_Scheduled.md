# Schedule Wordpress Automate Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
2. **Slack** `slack` — text: "=Zoom recurring meeting updated!
{{ $('Zoom').item.json.join_url }}", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating a recurring Zoom meeting link. It starts with a Schedule Trigger that resets the Zoom meeting link annually. It then updates a WordPress page to redirect visitors to the new Zoom meeting link. Finally, it sends a notification to a Slack channel with the updated Zoom link, ensuring all stakeholders have the latest meeting information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure that their team always has the correct Zoom link for a recurring annual meeting, reducing confusion and ensuring seamless communication.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Zoom, WordPress, and Slack accounts.
3. Set up the Schedule Trigger for the desired interval.
4. Customize the WordPress page ID and Slack channel ID.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates and notifies correctly.

### Practice
Create a dummy WordPress page and Slack channel, then run the workflow. Observe how the Zoom link is updated and how notifications are sent. Modify the schedule or notifications to see how changes affect the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can streamline meeting management for clients, ensuring they always have the latest information. This can improve client satisfaction and open opportunities for offering similar automation solutions, generating additional income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
