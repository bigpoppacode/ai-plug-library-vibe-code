# Schedule Youtube Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, twitter, openAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "221.82716049382665", height: "308.7901234567902"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "244.34567901234558", height: "102.81481481481477", content: "**Use AI to Promote Your New YouTube Videos on X**

🎬 Watch the [Setup Video Here](https://mrc.fm/ai2x)"
4. **Check Every 30 Min** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Fetch Latest Videos** `youTube` — resource: **video**
6. **Generate Post for X with ChatGPT** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
7. **Post to X** `twitter` — text: "={{ $json.message.content }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically promotes new YouTube videos on X (Twitter). Every 30 minutes, it checks for new videos on a specified YouTube channel. If a new video is found, it uses ChatGPT to generate a short, engaging post about the video, including a link to it. Finally, the generated post is published on X (Twitter).

### Demonstrate
A YouTube content creator could use this workflow to automatically announce new videos on their X account, increasing visibility and engagement without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your YouTube and Twitter accounts.
3. Set your YouTube Channel ID in the workflow.
4. Customize the ChatGPT prompt if desired.
5. Activate the workflow to start scheduled checks.

### Practice
Create a test YouTube channel and upload a video. Run the workflow to see it fetch the video, generate a post, and publish it on a test X account. Adjust the prompt to tweak the message style.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by automating social media promotion for clients, saving them time and boosting their content's reach, ultimately leading to increased client satisfaction and retention.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** twitterOAuth2Api, openAiApi, youTubeOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
