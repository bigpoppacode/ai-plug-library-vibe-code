# Schedule HTTP Monitor Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "660", height: "360"
3. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "660", height: "740"
4. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Setup** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **Products to Monitor** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to monitor Amazon product prices using the ScrapeOps API. It retrieves product information from a Google Sheets document, checks the current price, calculates any price changes, and updates the sheet with this information. If a significant price change is detected, it sends an email alert. It also logs the price history for trend analysis.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to track the prices of competitors’ products on Amazon. This helps in making informed pricing decisions and staying competitive in the market.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up Google Sheets and ScrapeOps API credentials.  
3. Update the Google Sheets URL in the Setup node.  
4. Define the ASINs of products to monitor in the Google Sheets.  
5. Schedule the workflow to run at desired intervals to keep track of price changes.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Google Sheet with a few sample ASINs of Amazon products. Run the workflow to see how it updates the sheet with pricing information and logs changes. Adjust the alert thresholds to see how email alerts are triggered for significant price changes.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer price monitoring services to e-commerce businesses, helping them optimize their pricing strategy. This can expand your service offerings and increase your revenue potential in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, smtp.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
