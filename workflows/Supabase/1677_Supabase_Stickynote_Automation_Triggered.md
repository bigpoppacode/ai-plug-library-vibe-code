# Supabase Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×5, vectorStoreSupabase×3, embeddingsOpenAi×3.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
3. **Default Data Loader** `documentDefaultDataLoader` — loader: "epubLoader", options: "[object Object]", dataType: "binary"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "749.1276349295781", height: "820.5109034066329", content: "# INSERTING

- it's important to use the same embedding model when for any interaction with your vector database (inserting, upserting and retrieval)"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "873.9739981925188", height: "534.0012007720542"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "876.5116990000852", height: "821.787041589866"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "810.9488123113013", height: "821.9537074055816"
8. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
9. **Vector Store Retriever** `retrieverVectorStore` — topK: "10"
10. **Recursive Character Text Splitter1** `textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` — options: "[object Object]"
11. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "=Hi there! 🙏

You can ask me anything about Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's Book - 'How To Transform Your Life'

What would you like to know? "
12. **Retrieve by Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — options: "[object Object]", tableName: "[object Object]"
13. **Embeddings OpenAI Retrieval** `embeddingsOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
14. **Embeddings OpenAI Insertion** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
15. **Placeholder (File/Content to Upsert)** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "={
 "Date": "{{ $now.format('dd MMM yyyy') }}",
 "Time": "{{ $now.format('HH:mm ZZZZ z') }}"
}
"
16. **Embeddings OpenAI Upserting** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
17. **Retrieve Rows from Table** `supabase` — operation: **getAll**, table: `n8n`
18. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "1587.0771183771394", height: "537.3056597675153"
19. **Insert Documents** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", tableName: "[object Object]"
20. **Question and Answer Chain** `chainRetrievalQa` — configured for its default action.
21. **Update Documents** `vectorStoreSupabase` — id: "1", mode: "update", options: "[object Object]"
22. **Customize Response** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This n8n workflow is designed to download a document from Google Drive, process it using OpenAI embeddings to generate vector representations, and store these vectors in a Supabase vector database. This setup allows for efficient querying and retrieval of information using AI models, enabling advanced interactions like question-answering based on the document's content.

**Demonstrate**: A researcher could use this workflow to upload academic papers to Google Drive, convert them to vector forms, and store them in a database. This allows them to quickly retrieve relevant information or answer specific questions about the papers without manually searching through each document.

**Imitate**: To adapt this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your Google Drive and OpenAI accounts, and configure the Supabase node with your database details. Customize the document processing settings and ensure the vector database is correctly set up for storing embeddings.

**Practice**: Set up a test scenario by uploading a sample document to Google Drive, running the workflow, and querying the Supabase database to see how information is retrieved based on specific questions. Adjust settings to improve retrieval accuracy.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can position you as an expert in AI-powered document management systems, appealing to businesses needing efficient data retrieval systems. This expertise can lead to consulting opportunities, helping clients streamline operations and enhance data accessibility.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
