# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, readWriteFile, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Write Result File to Disk (readWriteFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Download first remote PDF File (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Download second PDF File (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: PDF merge API HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading two PDF files, merging them into one, and saving the result to disk. It starts with a manual trigger and includes HTTP requests to fetch the files, followed by a merge action and a file write operation.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the preparation of reports that need to combine multiple PDF documents into one file for easier distribution, saving time and reducing manual errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Insert two HTTP Request nodes to download desired PDFs.
4. Use a PDF merge API HTTP Request node to combine the files.
5. Add a Write File node to save the merged PDF to disk.
6. Execute the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to download different PDF files or change the file names in the Write File node. Test the workflow to verify that it functions correctly and saves the merged document as intended.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to automate tedious document management tasks, making you more valuable to clients by saving them time and reducing errors. This skill can help you attract customers seeking efficient automation solutions, ultimately generating income through your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "PDF merge API HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
