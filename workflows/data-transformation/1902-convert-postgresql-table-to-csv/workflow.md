# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, spreadsheetFile, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Spreadsheet File (spreadsheetFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: TableName (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Postgres (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of executing a task triggered manually. It collects data from a spreadsheet, sets a table name, retrieves information from a PostgreSQL database, and outputs the results, streamlining data management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate report generation. For instance, after clicking "Execute Workflow," the workflow retrieves sales data from a PostgreSQL database and exports it as a CSV file, saving time on manual data handling.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node** to start the workflow.
3. Add a **Spreadsheet File Node** to specify the data source.
4. Add a **Set Node** to define the table name (e.g., "salesData").
5. Add a **Postgres Node** to execute a query using the table name.
6. Connect the nodes and test the workflow by clicking "Execute Workflow."

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to pull data from a different table in your PostgreSQL database. Change the table name in the Set Node and adjust the query in the Postgres Node to see how the workflow adapts to new data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data retrieval and reporting, enhancing efficiency and accuracy. This skill can help you attract clients seeking automation solutions, ultimately leading to increased revenue and business growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Postgres" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
