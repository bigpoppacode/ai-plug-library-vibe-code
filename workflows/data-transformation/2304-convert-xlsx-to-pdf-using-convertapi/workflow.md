# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, readWriteFile, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Write Result File to Disk (readWriteFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Download XLSX File (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: File conversion to PDF (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting an XLSX file into a PDF. It starts when triggered manually, downloads an XLSX file, converts it to PDF, and saves the result to disk.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically convert sales reports from Excel to PDF for distribution. This saves time on manual conversions and ensures consistent formatting.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Insert an HTTP Request node to download an XLSX file (set the URL).
4. Add another HTTP Request node to convert the file to PDF.
5. Use the Write File node to save the PDF to disk.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the XLSX file URL to one from your own data source. Execute the workflow and check if the PDF is created correctly on your disk.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation skills, making you more valuable to clients looking for efficient document handling solutions, ultimately helping you generate more income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "File conversion to PDF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
