2. **Step 1: Twitter (twitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Postgres (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: MongoDB (mongoDb)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Slack (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Google Cloud Natural Language (googleCloudNaturalLanguage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering tweets with the hashtag #OnThisDay, analyzes their sentiment using AI, stores the results in a database, and sends alerts to a Slack channel when the sentiment score exceeds a certain threshold.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor and analyze daily tweets about historical events. It automates sentiment analysis, allowing them to engage with their audience based on positive or negative feedback, enhancing their social media strategy.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Cron** node to trigger daily.
3. Connect a **Twitter** node to search for #OnThisDay tweets.
4. Use a **MongoDB** node to store the tweets.
5. Integrate **Google Cloud Natural Language** for sentiment analysis.
6. Use a **Set** node to format the data.
7. Connect an **IF** node to filter based on sentiment score.
8. Add a **Slack** node to send notifications if the score exceeds a threshold.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to analyze tweets with a different hashtag or to store the results in a different database (like PostgreSQL). Observe how the changes affect the workflow's output and alerts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to businesses, enabling them to monitor social media sentiment effectively. This can lead to improved customer engagement and potentially generate income through consulting or service contracts.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Twitter" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
