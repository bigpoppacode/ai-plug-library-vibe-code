### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating a PDF document from an HTML template. It starts with a manual trigger, creates HTML content, converts it to a file, and finally transforms that file into a PDF, saving it to disk.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate client report generation. For instance, after a monthly meeting, they can produce a PDF report summarizing the discussion and action items, ensuring timely delivery and professionalism.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use a **Set** node to define your HTML content.
4. Add a **Code** node to convert HTML to a file.
5. Use an **HTTP Request** node to convert the file to PDF.
6. Finish with a **ReadWriteFile** node to save the PDF.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the HTML content in the **Set** node. Change the text and layout, then run the workflow to see how the PDF output differs. This helps reinforce the process of generating documents.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable services like automated report generation or documentation for clients, enhancing your value proposition as an AI automation consultant and opening new revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Convert File to PDF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
