# Slack Cron Automate Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending a daily Slack message summarizing your Google Calendar events for the day. It triggers every morning at 6 AM, retrieves all events from your Google Calendar, formats the date and time for each event, checks if the event is happening today, and sends a Slack message with the event details if they match today's date.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to receive a daily summary of meetings and appointments. This ensures they start their day with a clear overview of their schedule, improving time management and reducing the risk of missed meetings.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Calendar and Slack accounts.
3. Set the Cron trigger to your desired time.
4. Customize the Slack message format if needed.
5. Activate the workflow and test it to ensure it correctly identifies today's events.

### Practice
Create a test event in your Google Calendar scheduled for today. Run the workflow manually to verify that it captures the event and sends the correct details to your Slack channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer time-saving solutions to clients, helping them stay organized and focused. This can lead to improved client satisfaction, retention, and the potential for additional automation projects, boosting your business's value proposition.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
