# Slack Hunter Send Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **n8n Form Trigger**.
2. **n8n Form Trigger** `formTrigger` — path: `/0bf8840f-1cc4-46a9-86af-a3fa8da80608`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "547", height: "158"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "139"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "84"
6. **Verify email with Hunter** `hunter` — operation: **emailVerifier**
7. **Check if the email is valid** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Score lead with MadKudu** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.madkudu.com/v1/persons?email={{ $json.email }}`
9. **Email is not valid, do nothing** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
10. **if customer fit score > 60** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
11. **Slack** `slack` — text: "=⭐ Got a hot lead for you  {{ $json.properties.first_name }} {{ $json.properties.last_name }} from  {{ $json.company.properties.name }} ({{ $json.company.properties.domain }}) base…[truncated]", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"
12. **Not interesting enough** `noOp` — configured for its default action.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates lead processing by verifying email addresses and scoring potential leads. It starts with a form submission that captures an email. The email is verified using Hunter to ensure it's valid. If valid, the workflow scores the lead with MadKudu to assess its quality. Leads with a score above 60 are considered "hot" and a notification is sent to a Slack channel. Invalid emails or leads with low scores are ignored.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline their lead qualification process, ensuring only high-quality leads reach their sales team, thus improving efficiency and focus on valuable prospects.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up an n8n account and import the workflow.  
2. Connect your Hunter, MadKudu, and Slack accounts.  
3. Customize the form fields and Slack channel.  
4. Test the workflow with sample data.  
5. Activate the workflow to start processing real leads.

**Practice:**  
Create a simple test form and submit a few email addresses, including some invalid ones. Check how the workflow verifies and processes them, and view the results in Slack for valid, high-scoring leads.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing automated lead qualification, reducing manual tasks, and increasing focus on promising leads. This can boost your value to clients, leading to better client retention and potential income growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, httpHeaderAuth, hunterApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
