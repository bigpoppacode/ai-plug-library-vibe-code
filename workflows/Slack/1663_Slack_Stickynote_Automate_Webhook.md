# Slack Stickynote Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works

2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280", height: "380"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", height: "380", content: "## Command Switch

Switch each slash command.

각 슬래시 커맨드를 분기하세요."

8. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "340", height: "400"
9. **Sticky Note10** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "340", height: "400"
10. **Switch** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **Basic LLM Chain** `chainLlm` — text: "={{ $json.body.text }}", promptType: "define"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to manage Slack slash commands and send messages using AI. It starts with a webhook that listens for commands from Slack. Based on the command received, it uses a switch node to determine the action, such as generating a message through an AI model (OpenAI) and sending it back to Slack. It automates the process of handling different commands and generating appropriate responses.

**Demonstrate:** A business could use this workflow to automate customer support on Slack. By interpreting slash commands, it can provide instant AI-generated responses, improving response time and efficiency.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up a webhook URL in Slack for your slash commands. 3. Customize the switch node to handle different commands. 4. Connect your OpenAI and Slack accounts. 5. Test the workflow by sending a slash command in Slack.

**Practice:** Create a basic version of this workflow by setting up a simple command in Slack that triggers a predefined message response. Then, gradually add AI-generated responses to enhance functionality.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer AI-driven customer interaction solutions to businesses, increasing efficiency and client satisfaction. This can expand your service offerings and generate additional revenue streams in the automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
