# Slack Stripe Create Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Send Deal not found message**.
2. **Send Deal not found message** `slack` — channel/topic: `team-accounts`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating HubSpot and notifying a Slack channel when a Stripe invoice is paid. It starts by detecting a successful invoice payment in Stripe. It then attempts to find a corresponding deal in HubSpot using a Purchase Order (PO) number. If the PO number is missing, it sends a Slack message indicating the missing PO. If the deal is found, it updates the deal status to "Paid" and sends a Slack notification. If no deal is found, it sends a Slack message notifying the team of the missing deal.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline their invoicing process, ensuring the sales team is instantly updated about payments and any discrepancies are quickly addressed, improving financial tracking and team coordination.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Stripe, HubSpot, and Slack accounts.
3. Customize the Slack channel and HubSpot deal details.
4. Test the workflow with a sample Stripe payment to ensure it updates HubSpot and sends Slack messages correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Stripe invoice and simulate a payment. Use the workflow to see how it updates HubSpot and sends notifications. Try different scenarios, like missing PO numbers, to see how the workflow handles them.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing automated financial tracking and communication solutions, increasing efficiency, and providing value to clients seeking to streamline their payment processes.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** stripeApi, hubspotOAuth2Api, hubspotApi, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
