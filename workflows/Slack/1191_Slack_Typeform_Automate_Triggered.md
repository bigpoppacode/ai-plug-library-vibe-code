# Slack Typeform Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
2. **Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `general`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting form submissions from Typeform, storing them in Airtable, and notifying a Slack channel. When someone fills out a Typeform with their name and email, the workflow captures this data, saves it to an Airtable database, and sends a notification to a specified Slack channel with the submission details.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline lead collection by automatically storing contact information from potential customers and notifying the sales team in Slack, ensuring prompt follow-up.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform, Airtable, and Slack accounts.
3. Set up a Typeform with fields for name and email.
4. Configure Airtable to store submissions.
5. Test the workflow by filling out the Typeform and checking Airtable and Slack for updates.

### Practice
Create a Typeform with a few test questions. Run the workflow to see how it captures and stores the data in Airtable and sends a Slack notification. Adjust the fields and test again to see how changes affect the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection and team notifications, enhancing client services and increasing efficiency. It can help you offer valuable automation services to businesses, potentially leading to increased income and client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, airtableApi, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
