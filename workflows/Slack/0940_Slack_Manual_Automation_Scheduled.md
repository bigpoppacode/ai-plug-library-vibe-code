# Slack Manual Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
2. **Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `n8n`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing invoices from Orlen. It runs daily at 23:45, retrieves unread emails with invoices from Orlen, determines the current year and month, and organizes them into specific folders on Google Drive. It then uploads the invoices to the appropriate monthly folder, marks the emails as read, and sends a Slack notification about the new invoice upload.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure all invoices from Orlen are automatically archived and organized in Google Drive, reducing manual handling, preventing lost invoices, and ensuring timely access to financial documents.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail, Google Drive, and Slack accounts.
3. Set the Google Drive folder structure to match your needs.
4. Adjust the email query to match your invoice sender email.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it uploads and notifies correctly.

### Practice
Set up a test environment with a few sample emails from Orlen. Run the workflow to see how it processes these emails, uploads invoices, and sends notifications. Experiment with different folder structures to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer invoice automation services, saving businesses time and reducing errors in financial document management. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2, slackOAuth2Api.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
