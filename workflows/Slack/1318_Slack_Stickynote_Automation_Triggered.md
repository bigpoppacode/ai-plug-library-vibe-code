# Slack Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

14. **Check if user has provided email** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
15. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
16. **Message Slack for help** `slack` — text: "={{ "A user had a question the bot couldn't answer. Here's their message: " + $('Execute Workflow Trigger').item.json.chatInput }}", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"
17. **Prompt the user to provide an email** `code` — jsCode: "response = {"response":"I'm sorry I don't know the answer. Please repeat your question and include your email address so I can request help."};

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle user queries with the help of AI and human intervention when necessary. It starts by capturing user input via a chat trigger. If the AI, powered by GPT-4, can't confidently answer a question, it checks if the user has provided an email. If not, it prompts the user to include an email address. If an email is provided, the workflow sends a message to a Slack channel to notify a human for assistance, ensuring the user's query is addressed.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow in customer support to handle inquiries. The AI attempts to answer, and if it can't, it seamlessly escalates the issue to human support, enhancing customer satisfaction by ensuring all queries are addressed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your chat interface to trigger the workflow.
3. Connect your GPT-4 and Slack accounts.
4. Customize the Slack channel for notifications.
5. Test the workflow by submitting queries and observing the AI and human escalation process.

### Practice
Create a test chat interface and enter queries the AI can't answer. Ensure the workflow prompts for an email and sends a Slack notification. Modify the AI's response criteria to see how it affects the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance customer service automation offerings, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction. This can lead to increased client retention and new business opportunities in AI-driven support systems.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
