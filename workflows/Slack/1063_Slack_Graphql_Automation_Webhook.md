# Slack Graphql Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
2. **Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `={{$node["Webhook"].json["body"]["channel_id"]}}`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow fetches GitHub user information when a Slack command is triggered. It uses a Webhook to receive the username, queries GitHub using GraphQL to get user details like name, company, location, and email, processes the data to filter out non-public emails, and sends the formatted information back to a specified Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to quickly gather and share GitHub user details in a team Slack channel. This is useful for team discussions about collaborators or contributors, saving time and ensuring everyone has accurate information.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Slack and GitHub accounts.
3. Set up a Webhook trigger in Slack to pass a GitHub username.
4. Test the workflow by sending a username via Slack to ensure it returns the correct details.

### Practice
Create a test Slack command to trigger the workflow with a known GitHub username. Verify the returned details in Slack. Experiment by changing the username and observing the workflow's output to understand how it handles different inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer GitHub-Slack integrations as a service, enhancing team collaboration tools. This could lead to new clients or upsell opportunities, as businesses seek streamlined communication solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** slackOAuth2Api.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
