# Slack Hubspot Send Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Send to Slack**.
2. **Send to Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `#hubspot-alerts`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking the validity of email addresses for new HubSpot contacts. When a contact is created, it fetches the contact's email, validates it for potential issues like poor deliverability or disposable domains, and if found suspicious, sends an alert to a Slack channel for further review.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their CRM is only populated with valid email addresses, reducing the risk of sending marketing emails to invalid or disposable addresses, thereby maintaining a healthy sender reputation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n setup.
2. Connect your HubSpot, One Simple API, and Slack accounts.
3. Set up a trigger for new contact creation in HubSpot.
4. Customize the Slack message format and channel.
5. Test the workflow with sample contacts to ensure it functions as expected.

### Practice
Create a test contact in HubSpot with a known invalid email. Run the workflow to see if it correctly identifies the email as suspicious and sends an alert to your Slack channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer email validation services, improving client email deliverability rates. This expertise can attract more clients and increase revenue by offering comprehensive CRM management solutions as part of your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** hubspotDeveloperApi, hubspotApi, oneSimpleApi, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
