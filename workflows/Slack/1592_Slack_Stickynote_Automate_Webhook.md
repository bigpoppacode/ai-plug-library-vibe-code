# Slack Stickynote Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280", height: "380"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", height: "380", content: "## Command Switch

Switch each slash command.

각 슬래시 커맨드를 분기하세요."
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "360", height: "380"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", height: "340", content: "## Send a Slack Message"
6. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/1bd05fcf-8286-491f-ae13-f0e6bff4aca6`
7. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
8. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "340", height: "400"
9. **Sticky Note10** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "340", height: "400"
10. **Switch** `switch` — rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
11. **Basic LLM Chain** `chainLlm` — text: "={{ $json.body.text }}", promptType: "define"
12. **Send a Message** `slack` — text: "={{ $json.text }}", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This n8n workflow creates an AI-powered chatbot in Slack using slash commands. When a specific command is entered, it triggers a webhook that processes the command through a switch node. Depending on the command, it uses the OpenAI Chat Model to generate a response and sends this response back to the Slack channel as a message.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer support by providing instant responses to common queries in Slack, thus improving response time and freeing up human resources for more complex issues.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up a Slack app and configure slash commands. 3. Connect your OpenAI account. 4. Customize the switch node to handle different commands. 5. Test by entering slash commands in Slack and verifying the responses.

**Practice:** Create a simple test Slack channel and set up a slash command to trigger the workflow. Experiment by adding different commands and observe how the workflow processes and responds to each command. Adjust the workflow to improve accuracy and response quality.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer AI chatbot solutions to clients, enhancing their customer interaction and support efficiency. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and open opportunities for offering advanced AI-driven services, thus boosting your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
