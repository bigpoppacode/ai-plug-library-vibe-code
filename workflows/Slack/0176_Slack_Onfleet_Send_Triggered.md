# Slack Onfleet Send Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
2. **Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `#new-driver-signup`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of notifying a Slack channel when a new driver signs up in Onfleet. It uses an Onfleet trigger to detect when a new driver is created and sends a message to the specified Slack channel, ensuring team members are promptly informed about new signups.

### Demonstrate
A delivery company could use this workflow to keep their operations team updated in real-time whenever a new driver is onboarded, enhancing coordination and ensuring smooth integration of new hires into their delivery system.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Onfleet and Slack accounts.
3. Set the Onfleet trigger to activate on new driver creation.
4. Specify the Slack channel for notifications.
5. Test the workflow by creating a new driver in Onfleet.

### Practice
Create a test driver in Onfleet and run the workflow. Check the specified Slack channel to see if the notification appears, confirming the setup works correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time operational updates to businesses, improving team communication and efficiency. This capability can enhance your service offerings, leading to greater customer satisfaction and potential revenue growth in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** onfleetApi, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
