### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating Salesforce records. When executed, it creates a new record for a company, updates the city for a lead, and adds a note indicating a deal was won.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the process.
3. Add a **Salesforce** node to create a new lead record.
4. Add a **Salesforce** node to update the lead's city.
5. Add another **Salesforce** node to log a note indicating the deal was won.
6. Connect the nodes in the order of execution and save your workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow: change the city update to another field, like "status," and adjust the note to reflect a different outcome. Execute the workflow to see how changes impact Salesforce records.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
