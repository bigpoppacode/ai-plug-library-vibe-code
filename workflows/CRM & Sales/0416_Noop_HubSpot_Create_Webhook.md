2. Set up OAuth2 credentials for HubSpot and ExactBuyer.
3. Modify the email and data fields in the "Update contact from Hubspot" node.
4. Test the workflow by creating a new contact in HubSpot.

### Practice
Experiment by creating a test contact in HubSpot and checking if the workflow successfully enriches that contact's information from ExactBuyer. Adjust the fields in the "Update contact from HubSpot" node to see how it affects the data.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
