# Autonomous Vehicle Log Summarizer
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Autonomous Vehicle Log Summarizer", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/autonomous_vehicle_log_summarizer`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "autonomous_vehicle_log_summarizer"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "autonomous_vehicle_log_summarizer"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow processes logs from autonomous vehicles. It receives data through a webhook, splits the data into manageable chunks, and converts it into embeddings using HuggingFace. These embeddings are then stored in a Weaviate vector database for efficient querying. The workflow also uses an AI agent to analyze the data and store the results in a Google Sheet, helping to summarize and log vehicle information efficiently.

**Demonstrate**  
A company managing a fleet of autonomous vehicles could use this workflow to automatically process and analyze vehicle logs, ensuring efficient data handling and quick access to insights about vehicle performance and behavior.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your accounts for HuggingFace, Weaviate, and Google Sheets.  
3. Set up a POST webhook to receive vehicle log data.  
4. Ensure the vector database and Google Sheet configurations match your data needs.  
5. Run the workflow to test data processing and logging.

**Practice**  
Create a test dataset of vehicle logs and use the workflow to process and analyze it. Check the Google Sheet for summarized results and adjust the workflow parameters to improve data handling.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer data processing and analysis services to companies in the autonomous vehicle industry. This can expand your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase revenue through advanced automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
