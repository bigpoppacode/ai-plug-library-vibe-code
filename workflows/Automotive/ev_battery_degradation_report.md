# Ev Battery Degradation Report
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## EV Battery Degradation Report", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/ev_battery_degradation_report`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "ev_battery_degradation_report"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "ev_battery_degradation_report"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of an EV Battery Degradation Report. It starts with receiving data via a Webhook, processes the text using a splitter, and generates embeddings to store in a Redis vector database. The data is queried and processed by an AI agent, which then logs the results in Google Sheets. This ensures efficient data handling and report generation for battery degradation analysis.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the analysis of EV battery performance data, helping a company efficiently monitor battery health and predict maintenance needs, thus reducing downtime and improving service quality.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook to receive data.
3. Connect Redis and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Configure the AI agent with your data processing logic.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample data to the Webhook.

### Practice
Create a test scenario by sending sample battery data through the Webhook. Observe how the data is processed, stored, and logged in Google Sheets. Modify the data to test different scenarios and ensure the workflow operates as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide advanced data analysis services, helping clients optimize operations and reduce costs. This expertise can attract new business opportunities and increase revenue through value-added services in the growing field of AI-driven automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, redisApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
