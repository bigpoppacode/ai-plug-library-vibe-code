# Fleet Fuel Efficiency Report
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Fleet Fuel Efficiency Report", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/fleet_fuel_efficiency_report`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "fleet_fuel_efficiency_report"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "fleet_fuel_efficiency_report"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow processes fleet fuel efficiency data. It starts by receiving data via a webhook. The data is then split into manageable chunks, embedded with Hugging Face for semantic understanding, and stored in a Weaviate vector database. The workflow queries the database to retrieve related data, uses AI to analyze and define the results, and logs the findings in a Google Sheet for reporting purposes.

### Demonstrate
A logistics company could use this workflow to analyze and report on the fuel efficiency of its fleet. By automating data collection and analysis, the company can make informed decisions to optimize routes and reduce fuel costs.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a POST webhook to receive fleet data.
3. Connect Hugging Face, Weaviate, and Google Sheets.
4. Customize the splitter and embeddings for your data.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a mock dataset with vehicle fuel usage. Run the workflow to see how it processes and logs data. Adjust the chunk size and overlap in the splitter to observe changes in data handling.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer data-driven insights to logistics firms, helping them save costs on fuel. This expertise can attract clients looking for efficiency improvements, expanding your service offerings and increasing revenue potential in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
