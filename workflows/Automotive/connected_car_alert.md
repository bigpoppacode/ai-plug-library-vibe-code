# Connected Car Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Connected Car Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/connected_car_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "connected_car_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "connected_car_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow processes alerts from connected cars. It starts with a webhook that receives data, which is then split into manageable chunks. The data is embedded using OpenAI's embeddings model and stored in a Redis vector store. It queries the vector store to retrieve relevant information, processes the data using AI chat and agent nodes, and logs the results in a Google Sheet. This ensures that alerts are efficiently managed and stored for future reference.

**Demonstrate**  
A car manufacturer could use this workflow to monitor and analyze alerts from their connected vehicles. This helps in quickly identifying issues, improving vehicle reliability, and enhancing customer satisfaction through timely interventions.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the webhook to receive car alert data.  
3. Connect OpenAI and Redis accounts for embeddings and storage.  
4. Configure Google Sheets to log the results.  
5. Test the workflow by sending sample data to the webhook.

**Practice**  
Create a test webhook and send mock car alert data to it. Observe how the workflow processes the data, stores it in Redis, and logs it in a Google Sheet. Modify the data structure to see how different inputs affect the workflow.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer data processing and alert management services to automotive companies. This can enhance their vehicle monitoring systems, improve customer service, and provide a new revenue stream for your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, redisApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
