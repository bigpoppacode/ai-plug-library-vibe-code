# Recall Notice Tracker
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Recall Notice Tracker", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/recall_notice_tracker`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "recall_notice_tracker"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "recall_notice_tracker"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow is designed to track recall notices by collecting data via a webhook and processing it through various AI and data storage nodes. Initially, it receives recall notices through a POST request, processes the data by splitting and embedding it, stores it in Pinecone for vector-based querying, and logs results in Google Sheets. This setup enables efficient recall notice tracking and retrieval.

### Demonstrate
A product safety team might use this workflow to automatically track and manage recall notices, ensuring they have instant access to relevant information for compliance and customer notification purposes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Pinecone and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up the webhook to receive recall notices.
4. Customize the workflow to fit your specific data structure and storage needs.
5. Test the workflow with sample recall data to ensure proper logging and retrieval.

### Practice
Create a test webhook using a sample recall notice, then run the workflow. Check that the notice is correctly processed, stored in Pinecone, and logged in Google Sheets. Modify some data inputs to observe the workflow's flexibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated recall tracking services, which can enhance compliance and customer safety for businesses. This skill can attract clients looking to improve product safety management, providing a unique value proposition in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
