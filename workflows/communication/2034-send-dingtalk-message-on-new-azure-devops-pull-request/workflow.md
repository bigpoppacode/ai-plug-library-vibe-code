# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving mySql, webhook, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **LoadDingTalkAccountMap** node.
2. **Step 1: LoadDingTalkAccountMap (mySql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: ReceiveTfsPullRequestCreatedMessage (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: BuildDingTalkWebHookData (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: SendDingTalkMessageViaWebHook (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending notifications to DingTalk when a new pull request is created in Azure DevOps. It retrieves user mappings from a MySQL database, processes the pull request data, and sends a customized message to specific users on DingTalk.

### Demonstrate
A software development team can use this workflow to notify relevant team members via DingTalk whenever a new pull request is created. This ensures timely reviews, reduces bottlenecks, and improves collaboration without manual notifications.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Webhook Trigger** to receive pull request data.
3. Use **MySQL Node** to load user mappings.
4. Implement a **Function Node** to build the message based on the pull request data.
5. Use an **HTTP Request Node** to send the message to DingTalk.
6. Test the workflow by simulating a pull request creation.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that sends an email notification instead of a DingTalk message. Use a manual trigger to simulate a new pull request and see how the data flows through the workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide automation solutions that enhance team communication and efficiency, making you a valuable asset to businesses looking to streamline their development processes and improve collaboration.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "LoadDingTalkAccountMap" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
