# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, functionItem, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Email Parser Snippet (functionItem)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set values (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of key information from email messages. When executed, it parses an email body using predefined labels (like Name, Email, etc.) to extract structured data, making it easier to use in other applications.

### Demonstrate
A consultant receives inquiries via email that include essential information. By using this workflow, they can quickly extract data like names and emails from messy email content, saving time and reducing manual errors in data entry.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use a **Set** node to define sample email content and labels.
4. Add a **Function Item** node with the provided JavaScript code to parse the email body.
5. Execute the workflow to see extracted values.

### Practice
Try modifying the email body in the **Set** node with different formats or additional labels. Execute the workflow again and observe how the extraction adapts, reinforcing your understanding of the parsing logic.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data extraction tasks, improving efficiency and accuracy. This skill can help you attract clients looking for data management solutions, creating value and generating income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set values" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
