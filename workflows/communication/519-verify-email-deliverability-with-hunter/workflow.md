# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, hunter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Hunter (hunter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger that initiates the process. It then uses the Hunter API to verify an email address, ensuring it's valid before proceeding. This helps businesses maintain clean email lists.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to verify email addresses from a lead generation campaign, ensuring they only send marketing materials to valid addresses, thus improving email deliverability and reducing bounce rates.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Hunter** node and configure it with your API credentials.
4. Set the email parameter to verify.
5. Connect an output node to store or act on the verification result (e.g., update in Airtable).

### Practice
Try running the workflow with different email addresses (valid and invalid) to see how the Hunter API responds. Observe how the output changes based on the email validity.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to help clients ensure their marketing efforts are efficient, reducing costs from bounced emails and improving engagement. This skill can position you as a valuable consultant in email marketing automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Hunter" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
