# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Lark Token (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Input (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Send Message (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending a message when triggered manually. It retrieves an access token from Lark, sets up necessary input parameters (like app ID and chat ID), and sends a message to a specified chat using Lark's messaging API.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to send daily updates to their team on Lark. For instance, they could automate a message summarizing the previous day's sales every morning, ensuring the team stays informed without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert an **HTTP Request** node to get the Lark token.
4. Use a **Set** node to define input parameters (app ID, chat ID, message).
5. Add another **HTTP Request** node to send the message to Lark.
6. Connect the nodes and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying this workflow to send different messages based on varying conditions. For example, add an **If** node to check the day's sales and send a congratulatory message if they exceed a specific target.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate communication within your team, saving time and ensuring consistency. This skill can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, enhancing your marketability and potential income in an AI-driven business landscape.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Send Message" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
