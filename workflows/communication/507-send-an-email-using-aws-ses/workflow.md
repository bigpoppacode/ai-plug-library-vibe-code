# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, awsSes.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: AWS SES (awsSes)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email sending using AWS Simple Email Service (SES). When triggered manually, it sends an email with a predefined subject and body to specified recipients.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically send a welcome email to new subscribers. This saves time and ensures consistent communication without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **AWS SES** node for sending emails.
4. Configure the email parameters (subject, body, recipient).
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to test.

### Practice
Try modifying the email body and subject to create a personalized message. Execute the workflow to see how changes affect the output, ensuring you understand the process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate email communications, saving time and improving customer engagement. It can enhance your service offerings and increase client satisfaction, leading to more business opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "AWS SES" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
