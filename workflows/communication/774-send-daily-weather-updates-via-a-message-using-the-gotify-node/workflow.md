# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, openWeatherMap, gotify.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenWeatherMap (openWeatherMap)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Gotify (gotify)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending daily weather updates. It triggers every day at 9 AM, retrieves the current temperature in Berlin from OpenWeatherMap, and sends a notification with the temperature via Gotify.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate daily weather notifications for their team, ensuring everyone is informed about the weather before starting their day, which can help in planning outdoor meetings or events.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger daily at a desired time.
2. Add an OpenWeatherMap node to fetch weather data for your city.
3. Use a Gotify node to send a message containing the temperature.
4. Test the workflow to ensure notifications are sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow to send a daily motivational quote instead of weather data. Use a public API for quotes, and send the quote via email or another messaging service.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients, helping them save time and enhance communication. As you gain expertise, you can attract more customers and increase your income through automated solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Gotify" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
