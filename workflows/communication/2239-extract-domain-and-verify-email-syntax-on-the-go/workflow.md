# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set these fields to extract domain (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Generate random data (debugHelper)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email validation and domain extraction. When triggered, it generates a random email, checks if it's valid, extracts the domain, and displays the results in sticky notes, helping users understand the process.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure that email leads collected from a website are valid before adding them to their marketing list, reducing bounce rates and improving campaign effectiveness.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Debug Helper** node to generate random email data.
4. Use a **Set** node to validate the email and extract the domain.
5. Add **Sticky Notes** to display the results.
6. Execute the workflow to see how it works.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to use your actual email data source instead of the debug helper. Validate your own email list and observe the results in the sticky notes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, streamline their lead validation processes, and ultimately enhance their marketing effectiveness, leading to increased income opportunities for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
