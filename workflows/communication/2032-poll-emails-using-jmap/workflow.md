# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get mailboxes (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Fetch API details (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Format results (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get unread messages (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

8. **Step 7: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email management by fetching unread messages from a Fastmail account and displaying relevant details. It begins with a manual trigger, retrieves mailbox and email details via HTTP requests, formats the data, and presents it using sticky notes.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline their email management. For instance, a consultant can quickly check unread client emails daily without manually logging into their email account, saving time and enhancing responsiveness.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** as the starting point.
3. Use the **HTTP Request** node to get mailboxes from Fastmail.
4. Add another **HTTP Request** node to fetch unread messages.
5. Use a **Set** node to format the results for easier viewing.
6. Add **Sticky Note** nodes to display the formatted email information.
7. Execute the workflow to see the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch messages based on specific criteria (e.g., only emails from a certain sender) and display those results. This will help you understand data filtering and manipulation in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate email management for clients, providing them with faster response times and improved organization. This skill can help you attract more customers, increase your service offerings, and ultimately generate more income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
