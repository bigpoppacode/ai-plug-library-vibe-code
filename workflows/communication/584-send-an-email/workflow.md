# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, emailSend.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Send Email (emailSend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow sends an email when manually triggered. It starts by waiting for a user to click "execute," then sends an email with a specified subject and message to a designated recipient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate sending welcome emails to new subscribers. With just a button click, they can ensure timely communication without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **Email Send** node.
4. Configure the email details like recipient, subject, and body.
5. Save and execute the workflow to send the email.

### Practice
Try modifying the email body to include dynamic data (e.g., user name). Test the workflow by executing it and checking if the personalized email is sent correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate simple but essential tasks, saving time and enhancing communication. As part of an AI automation business, you can offer clients tailored solutions that improve efficiency and customer engagement.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Send Email" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
