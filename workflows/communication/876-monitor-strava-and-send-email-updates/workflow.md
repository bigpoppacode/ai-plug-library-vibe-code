# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving strava, set, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Strava** node.
2. **Step 1: Strava (strava)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Accountability Settings (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Check Activity Level (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Enough Activity (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Send Email (emailSend)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Check Daily at 11:AM (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain 
This n8n workflow automates checking your Strava activity levels daily at 11 AM. It fetches your activity data, compares it to a set threshold, and sends encouragement emails to accountability partners if your activity is below the goal.

### Demonstrate 
A fitness coach could use this workflow to monitor client activity levels. If a client hasn't met their exercise goal, the workflow automatically sends an email to their accountability partners, encouraging them to reach out and motivate the client.

### Imitate 
1. Set up a **Cron Trigger** to run daily at 11 AM.
2. Use the **Strava Node** to fetch your activity data.
3. Configure the **Set Node** to define your activity goal and accountability partners.
4. Add an **If Node** to check if your activity meets the goal.
5. If not met, use the **Email Node** to send encouragement to your partners.

### Practice 
Try changing the activity threshold in the **Set Node** and observe how it affects the emails sent. Test with different activity levels to see how the workflow responds and ensure it functions as intended.

### WIIFM 
Mastering this workflow helps you automate fitness accountability, enhancing your service offerings as a fitness coach or consultant. It can attract clients looking for structured support, ultimately increasing your income through value-added services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Strava" and "Check Daily at 11:AM" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
