# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, awsSns.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: AWS SNS (awsSns)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow starts with a manual trigger and sends a test message to an AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) topic. It allows users to execute tasks and send notifications easily.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to send alerts about critical updates, like server status or sales milestones, to team members via SMS or email using AWS SNS, ensuring everyone stays informed.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **AWS SNS** node and configure it with your AWS credentials.
4. Set the topic, message, and subject as needed.
5. Connect the manual trigger to the AWS SNS node.
6. Execute the workflow to test.

### Practice
Try modifying the message in the AWS SNS node to include specific updates about your business, then execute the workflow to see how notifications are sent.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate notifications for your business, improving communication and response times, which can enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, ultimately driving growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "AWS SNS" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
