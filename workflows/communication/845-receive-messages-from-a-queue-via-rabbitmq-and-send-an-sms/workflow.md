# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving rabbitmqTrigger, if, vonage.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **RabbitMQ** node.
2. **Step 1: RabbitMQ (rabbitmqTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Vonage (vonage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow listens for messages in a RabbitMQ queue, checks if the temperature exceeds 50, and sends an alert via Vonage if it does. If not, it proceeds without action.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor temperature-sensitive equipment. If the temperature rises too high, it sends an immediate SMS alert to prevent damage or loss.

### Imitate
1. Set up RabbitMQ to trigger the workflow.
2. Add an IF condition to check temperature values.
3. Connect a Vonage node to send SMS alerts.
4. Optionally, add NoOp for further actions if the condition is not met.

### Practice
Modify the workflow to check for a different threshold (e.g., 30) and send an email alert instead of an SMS. Test it with sample data in RabbitMQ.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate critical monitoring tasks, providing value to clients who need real-time alerts, ultimately helping you build a lucrative automation service.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "RabbitMQ" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
