## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting customer feedback via Typeform, analyzing the sentiment of that feedback using Google Cloud Natural Language, and storing the results in Notion and Trello while notifying a Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A restaurant owner could use this workflow to gather customer feedback after meals. When a customer submits feedback through a Typeform, the workflow analyzes sentiment (positive/negative) and logs it, helping the owner quickly address concerns or celebrate successes.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform for customer feedback.
2. Create an n8n workflow with a Typeform Trigger.
3. Add a Google Cloud Natural Language node for sentiment analysis.
4. Use an IF node to decide actions based on sentiment.
5. Log results in Notion and Trello, and send a Slack notification.

### Practice
Create a simple feedback form using Typeform, then build a basic n8n workflow that captures the responses. Experiment with the sentiment analysis feature and see how the data flows through the workflow, adjusting parameters as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate customer feedback processes, saving time and improving service quality. By offering such automation, you can attract clients, enhance their operations, and create a valuable service that generates income as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Typeform Trigger" and "Trello" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
