# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, wait, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **HTTP Request** node.
2. **Step 1: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Telegram1 (telegram)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: NoOp (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow checks a website for updates every 5 minutes. It makes two HTTP requests to the same URL, compares the results, and sends a Telegram message if changes are detected. 

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor a competitor's website for changes in product offerings or pricing. If a significant update occurs, they receive an immediate alert, allowing for timely strategic decisions.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance.
2. Create a new workflow with a **Cron** node to trigger every 5 minutes.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch data from your target URL.
4. Insert a **Wait** node (5 minutes) before adding a second **HTTP Request** node for a second fetch.
5. Use an **IF** node to compare results from both HTTP requests.
6. If changes are detected, configure a **Telegram** node to send a notification.

### Practice
Try modifying the URL in the first HTTP Request to monitor a different website of your choice. Test the workflow to see if it successfully detects changes and sends notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable monitoring services to clients, helping them stay updated on competitor activity or market changes. This skill can lead to new business opportunities and increased income as part of an automation consultancy.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTTP Request" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
