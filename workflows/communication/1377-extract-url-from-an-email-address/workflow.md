# Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Extract domain name (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sample email (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting a domain name from a provided email address. It starts with a manual trigger, takes an email input, processes it to isolate the domain, and outputs the result.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically categorize incoming emails by their domains. For example, a marketing consultant can streamline lead tracking by filtering emails based on their domains, helping to identify potential partnerships.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define an email (e.g., "email@domain.com").
4. Add a **Function** node to extract the domain from the email.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the extracted domain.

### Practice
Try modifying the email input in the Set node with different email addresses. Execute the workflow to see how it extracts and displays various domains, reinforcing the understanding of string manipulation in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data extraction tasks, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient data processing solutions, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Sample email" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
