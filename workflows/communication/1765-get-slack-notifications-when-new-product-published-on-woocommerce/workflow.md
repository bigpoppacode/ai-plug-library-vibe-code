### Explain
This n8n workflow automates notifications for new WooCommerce products. When a product is created, it checks if the URL contains "/product/" and sends a message to a Slack channel with product details, keeping the team informed instantly.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline product launches. Instead of manually notifying the team, they automate Slack alerts, ensuring everyone is updated on new products, which enhances collaboration and speeds up the response to market changes.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **WooCommerce Trigger** to listen for new product creations.
3. Include an **If Node** to check if the URL contains "/product/".
4. Add a **Slack Node** to send a message with product details if the condition is met.
5. Execute the workflow to see it in action.

### Practice
Try modifying the Slack message formatting. Change the text or add more product details like categories or stock levels. This will help you understand how to customize notifications based on specific needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automation services that save clients time and improve communication. By providing real-time alerts, you can enhance operational efficiency, making your service invaluable for businesses looking to scale.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "If URL has /product/" and "On product creation" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
