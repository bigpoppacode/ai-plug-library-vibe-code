# Cortex Emailreadimap Send
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **OTX DOMAIN**.
  2. **OTX DOMAIN** `theHive` — resource: **observable**, operation: **executeAnalyzer**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing email attachments for potential threats. It starts by reading emails using IMAP, creating a case in TheHive for each attachment. The workflow then promotes the case to observable status, executes analyzers on the email attachments using Cortex, and checks for indicators of compromise (IOCs) like domains, emails, and IPs. If any IOCs are found, the workflow updates the case with these findings and performs further analysis to ensure email security.

**Demonstrate**  
A cybersecurity firm could use this workflow to automatically assess email attachments for threats. This ensures that any potential security risks are identified and managed quickly, protecting the organization from cyber attacks.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your IMAP and TheHive accounts.
3. Set up the IMAP node to read emails.
4. Configure TheHive and Cortex nodes with your credentials.
5. Test the workflow by sending an email with an attachment to see how it processes and analyzes the file.

**Practice**  
Create a test email with a benign attachment and run the workflow. Observe how the workflow processes the email, creates a case, and performs analysis. Modify the attachment to simulate a threat and see how the workflow reacts.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer email threat analysis services, adding value to your cybersecurity offerings. This can help attract new clients and provide a steady income stream by managing and securing their email communications.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** imap, theHiveApi, cortexApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
