# Googlesheetstool Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — public: "true", options: "[object Object]", initialMessages: "Hi! I’m Babish from Apple Case. How can I help?”"
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
5. **Place order** `googleSheetsTool` — operation: **append**
6. **Update Stock** `googleSheetsTool` — operation: **update**
7. **GetStock** `googleSheetsTool` — options: "[object Object]", filtersUI: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
8. **Support Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates customer and sales support for an Apple case business. It starts by receiving a chat message, uses an AI model to understand the customer's needs, and accesses Google Sheets to manage orders and update stock. It checks inventory, places orders, and updates stock records, ensuring efficient customer interaction and inventory management.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to streamline online sales, ensuring customer inquiries are instantly addressed, orders are processed, and stock levels are updated, reducing manual work and improving customer satisfaction.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your OpenAI and Google Sheets accounts. 3. Set up the chat trigger to receive customer messages. 4. Customize Google Sheets to match your inventory and order data. 5. Test the workflow to ensure orders and stock updates are processed correctly.

- **Practice:** Set up a test Google Sheet with sample inventory data and simulate a customer chat interaction. Observe how the workflow processes an order and updates the stock. Modify variables to see how the workflow handles different scenarios.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer efficient customer support and inventory management services to businesses, enhancing your service portfolio. This expertise can attract new clients and generate income by automating sales and support processes.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
