# Github Commit Jenkins
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: GitHub Commit Jenkins", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/github-commit-jenkins`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "github_commit_jenkins"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "github_commit_jenkins"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'GitHub Commit Jenkins':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the processing of GitHub commit data using Jenkins. It starts with a Webhook Trigger that receives commit data. The data is split and embedded using OpenAI's embeddings, then stored and queried in Supabase. A RAG Agent processes the data, and results are logged in Google Sheets. If any errors occur, a Slack alert is sent.

**Demonstrate:** A software development team could use this workflow to automatically process GitHub commits, extract meaningful insights, and log them for further analysis, ensuring that all team members are updated on code changes efficiently.

**Imitate:** 1. Set up a Webhook in n8n for GitHub commits. 2. Connect Supabase for data storage. 3. Configure OpenAI embeddings for data processing. 4. Set up Google Sheets for logging results. 5. Add Slack for error alerts. 6. Test the workflow with sample commit data.

**Practice:** Create a test GitHub repository, make a few commits, and trigger the workflow. Observe how the data is processed and logged. Modify the workflow to handle different commit data or add extra processing steps.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated code review and logging services to development teams, enhancing their efficiency and communication. This can lead to increased demand for your automation expertise and open opportunities for consulting or service-based income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
