  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to notify a Mattermost channel whenever a user updates their profile on Facebook. It uses a Facebook Trigger to detect changes in user profiles, then sends a message to a specified Mattermost channel detailing the user's ID and the specific profile change made, such as an updated field or value.

### Demonstrate
A social media manager could use this workflow to keep their team informed about changes in influencer profiles they track, allowing them to quickly respond to new opportunities or changes in the influencer's brand presence.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Facebook Trigger with your Facebook app credentials.
3. Connect your Mattermost account.
4. Specify the Mattermost channel ID where you want notifications sent.
5. Test the workflow by updating a Facebook profile to ensure it sends the correct message to Mattermost.

### Practice
Create a test Facebook account and a Mattermost channel. Update the profile fields on the Facebook account, and observe how the workflow sends updates to the Mattermost channel. Experiment with different profile fields to see how the workflow reacts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time social media monitoring services, keeping clients informed of changes in key profiles. This can enhance client engagement and enable you to offer premium services, increasing your income as an automation consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** facebookGraphAppApi, mattermostApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
