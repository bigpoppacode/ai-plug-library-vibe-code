# Netlify Airtable Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Airtable**.
  2. **Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **append**, table: `Table 1`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the collection of form submissions from a Netlify site and stores them in an Airtable database. When a form is submitted on the specified Netlify site, the workflow captures the submission details (such as name, email, and role), processes these details, and appends them to a designated table in Airtable. This ensures all form data is systematically recorded for further analysis or use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently collect and store customer inquiries from their website, ensuring no potential lead is missed and all data is readily available for analysis or follow-up actions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Netlify and Airtable accounts.
3. Set the Netlify Trigger to your specific form ID and site ID.
4. Map the form fields (name, email, role) in the Set node.
5. Link the workflow to your Airtable account and specify the correct table.

### Practice
Create a test form on your Netlify site and submit a test entry. Run the workflow to ensure the data is correctly captured and appended to your Airtable table. Adjust the field mappings if necessary.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data collection services, helping businesses efficiently track customer interactions and streamline their lead management processes. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract more clients, and increase your income potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** netlifyApi, airtableApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
