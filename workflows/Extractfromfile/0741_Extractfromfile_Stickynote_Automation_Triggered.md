# Extractfromfile Stickynote Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using embeddingsCohere×2, vectorStoreMilvus×2, documentDefaultDataLoader.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **Default Data Loader** `documentDefaultDataLoader` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Embeddings Cohere** `embeddingsCohere` — modelName: "embed-multilingual-v3.0"
4. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
5. **Watch New Files** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
6. **Retrieve from Milvus** `vectorStoreMilvus` — mode: "retrieve-as-tool", topK: "10", toolName: "vector_store"
7. **OpenAI 4o** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
8. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
9. **Cohere embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — modelName: "embed-multilingual-v3.0"
10. **Set Chunks** `textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` — options: "[object Object]", chunkSize: "700", chunkOverlap: "60"
11. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "540", height: "600"
12. **RAG Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
13. **Download New** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
14. **Extract from File** `extractFromFile` — operation: **pdf**
15. **Insert into Milvus** `vectorStoreMilvus` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", milvusCollection: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing files and data for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agent using Milvus and Cohere. It monitors a Google Drive folder for new PDF files, downloads and extracts their contents, and converts these into vector embeddings using Cohere. These embeddings are stored in a Milvus vector database. When a chat message is received, the workflow retrieves relevant information from Milvus to provide accurate responses using OpenAI, enhancing the AI's contextual understanding with specific, up-to-date data from your documents.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to enhance customer support by providing accurate, document-based answers to inquiries. When a new product manual is added to the Drive, it is instantly available for AI to reference in customer chats.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Drive folder for PDFs.
2. Connect n8n with Google Drive, Cohere, and Milvus.
3. Configure the workflow to trigger on new file creation.
4. Ensure the AI agent is set to retrieve and use data from Milvus.
5. Test with a sample PDF to see the AI respond with document-based information.

### Practice
Create a test Google Drive folder and add a few PDF documents. Run the workflow to see how it processes the files and updates Milvus. Send a chat message to the AI and observe how it retrieves and uses the document information.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer advanced AI solutions to clients, enabling them to provide precise information quickly, improving customer satisfaction and potentially increasing sales. This expertise can enhance your service offerings and increase your income in the AI automation market.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, googleDriveOAuth2Api, milvusApi, openAiApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
