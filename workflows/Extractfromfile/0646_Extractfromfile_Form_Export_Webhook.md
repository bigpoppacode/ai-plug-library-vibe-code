  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Step 1 of 2 - Upload CV**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model1** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates a job application process. It starts by accepting a CV via a form, checks its validity, and extracts relevant data using AI. The extracted information is then saved to Airtable. Applicants can review and amend details in a subsequent form, ensuring data accuracy and efficiency in handling applications.

- **Demonstrate:** A recruitment agency could use this workflow to streamline their hiring process, reducing the time spent manually reviewing applications and ensuring that only complete and relevant data is captured and stored.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n. Connect your Airtable and OpenAI accounts. Customize the forms and Airtable fields to match your application process. Test the workflow by submitting a sample CV and verifying the data extraction and storage.

- **Practice:** Create a test CV in PDF format and submit it through the workflow. Observe how the AI extracts information and how the data is updated in Airtable. Try altering the CV's content to see how the AI handles different inputs.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a streamlined application processing service, enhancing efficiency and accuracy for businesses. This can expand your service offerings and increase your potential income by providing a valuable automation solution to clients.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, airtableTokenApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
