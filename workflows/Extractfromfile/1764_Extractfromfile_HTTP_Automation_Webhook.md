8. **Setup1** `set` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
9. **Only invoice mails with attachments** `if` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
10. **Upload PDF to Drive1** `httpRequest` ‚Äî method: **POST**, url: `https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v3/files`
11. **Rename file1** `googleDrive` ‚Äî operation: **update**
12. **Move to the correct folder1** `googleDrive` ‚Äî operation: **move**

14. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` ‚Äî operation: **download**
15. **Extract from File2** `extractFromFile` ‚Äî operation: **pdf**
16. **Apply Data Extraction Rules** `chainLlm` ‚Äî text: "=Given the following invoice in the <invoice> xml tags, extract the following information as listed below.
If you cannot the information for a specific item, then leave blank and s‚Ä¶[truncated]", promptType: "define", hasOutputParser: "true"
17. **Map Output** `set` ‚Äî mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "={{ $json.output }}"
18. **Append to Reconciliation Sheet** `googleSheets` ‚Äî operation: **append**
  
  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling invoice emails. It triggers when a new email arrives in Gmail with attachments, verifies if they are invoices, and uploads PDFs to Google Drive. It then uses OpenAI to extract key invoice details, such as date, description, and total price, which are then appended to a Google Sheets document for reconciliation. Finally, the email is marked as read.

**Demonstrate:**
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline their invoice processing, reducing manual data entry and ensuring all invoice data is accurately captured and stored for future reference.

**Imitate:**
1. Set up Gmail, Google Drive, Google Sheets, and OpenAI credentials in n8n.
2. Create a Gmail trigger for new emails with attachments.
3. Configure file upload to Google Drive.
4. Set up OpenAI to extract invoice data.
5. Append extracted data to Google Sheets.
6. Test the workflow with sample invoice emails.

**Practice:**
Create a test Gmail account and send emails to it with PDF invoices attached. Run the workflow and check if the invoices are uploaded to Google Drive and the data is correctly extracted and appended to Google Sheets.

**WIIFM:**
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate tedious invoice processing, saving time and reducing errors. As a service provider, you can offer this as a solution to clients, helping them improve efficiency and accuracy in financial operations, potentially increasing your revenue stream.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, googleDriveOAuth2Api, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
