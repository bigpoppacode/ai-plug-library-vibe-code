# Postgrestool Stickynote Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "215", height: "80"
3. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280.2462120317618", height: "545.9087885077763"
4. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "636.2128494576581", height: "497.1532689930921"
5. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "330.5152611046425", height: "239.5888196628349"
6. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
7. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **DB Schema** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
9. **Get table definition** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
10. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "215", height: "80", content: "**Finetune the prompt of assistant**"
11. **Run SQL Query** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
12. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $('When chat message received').item.json.chatInput }}", agent: "openAiFunctionsAgent", options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This workflow enables users to interact with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase through a conversational AI agent. When a chat message is received, the AI agent, powered by OpenAI, interprets the user's request and generates SQL queries to interact with the database. It can retrieve records, analyze JSON data, and provide summaries or specific data points based on the user’s input, streamlining data retrieval and analysis without requiring SQL expertise.

**Demonstrate**: A data analyst can use this workflow to quickly extract insights from a database by simply typing a question in natural language, saving time and avoiding the need for complex SQL queries.

**Imitate**: 
1. Set up accounts with n8n, Supabase, and OpenAI.
2. Prepare a PostgreSQL database in Supabase.
3. Import the workflow into n8n.
4. Connect your accounts and configure the database connection.
5. Customize the AI agent's prompt to suit your specific needs.

**Practice**: Create a simple database in Supabase and use the workflow to retrieve data by asking questions in natural language. Experiment with different types of queries and observe how the AI agent formulates SQL queries.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer AI-driven data interaction services, enhancing your value proposition to clients by enabling them to access and analyze data effortlessly, potentially leading to new business opportunities and increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
