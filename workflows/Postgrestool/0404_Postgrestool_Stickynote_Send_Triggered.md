# Postgrestool Stickynote Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "## Try me out
Click the 'chat' button at the bottom of the canvas and paste in:

_Which tables are available?_"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "677", height: "505"
4. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
5. **Postgres** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
6. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
7. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
8. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to interact with a Postgres database via a chat interface. When a chat message is received, the workflow triggers an AI agent to generate a SQL query using an OpenAI model. This query is then executed on the Postgres database to retrieve information, such as available table names, and the results are processed and stored in a memory buffer for reference in future interactions.

### Demonstrate
A developer could implement this workflow to allow team members to query a database interactively during meetings, improving data accessibility and decision-making speed without needing direct database access or SQL knowledge.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Postgres and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set the chat trigger to initiate on message reception.
4. Customize the query logic as needed for your database.
5. Test by sending a chat query like "Which tables are available?"

### Practice
Create a test database with mock data and use the workflow to practice querying different tables. Modify the SQL query logic in OpenAI's prompt to see how changes affect the output. This will help you understand the workflow's flexibility and potential applications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer dynamic database interaction tools to clients, simplifying complex data retrieval processes. This capability can diversify your service offerings, attract data-driven businesses, and generate additional income by enhancing client data accessibility.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres, openAiApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
