# Postgrestool Stickynote Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **Get Table Definition** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "560", height: "120"
6. **Chat History** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "562", height: "156"
8. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "99"
9. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "162", height: "159"
10. **Execute SQL Query** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
11. **Get DB Schema and Tables List** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
12. **AI Agent** `agent` — agent: "openAiFunctionsAgent", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow enables interaction with a PostgreSQL database through a chat interface. When a chat message is received, it triggers an AI agent that uses OpenAI to interpret the request and generate SQL queries. The workflow retrieves database schema information, executes SQL queries, and returns the results to the user, facilitating seamless data queries and analysis through natural language.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner can use this workflow to easily query their sales database by simply asking questions in a chat, like "What were the sales figures for last quarter?" This streamlines data access without needing to write SQL code.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your PostgreSQL and OpenAI credentials.
3. Configure the chat trigger and AI agent settings.
4. Test the workflow by sending a chat message that queries your database.
5. Adjust the SQL query logic as needed for your specific database structure.

**Practice:**  
Create a sample PostgreSQL database with a few tables. Use the workflow to query data such as total sales or customer counts. Modify the AI prompts to refine the SQL queries generated based on your data structure.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer clients a powerful tool for accessing and analyzing their data without SQL knowledge. This can enhance decision-making, streamline operations, and add a valuable service to your automation business, potentially increasing client engagement and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
