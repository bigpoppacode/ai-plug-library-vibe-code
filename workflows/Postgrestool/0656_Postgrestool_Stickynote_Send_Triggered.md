# Postgrestool Stickynote Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
  2. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "215", height: "80"
3. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280.2462120317618", height: "545.9087885077763"
4. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "636.2128494576581", height: "497.1532689930921"
5. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "330.5152611046425", height: "239.5888196628349"
6. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
7. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **DB Schema** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
9. **Get table definition** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
10. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "215", height: "80", content: "**Finetune the prompt of assistant**"
11. **Run SQL Query** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
12. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $('When chat message received').item.json.chatInput }}", agent: "openAiFunctionsAgent", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase via an AI-powered agent integrated with OpenAI. When a chat message is received, the AI agent generates SQL queries based on user requests to retrieve, analyze, and summarize data from the database, making it easier to access information without needing SQL expertise.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly access sales data from their database by simply typing a request like "Show me last month's sales data," allowing for efficient decision-making without technical barriers.

### Imitate
1. Sign up for n8n, Supabase, and OpenAI accounts.
2. Create a PostgreSQL database on Supabase.
3. Import the workflow into n8n and configure the database and OpenAI credentials.
4. Test the workflow by sending chat messages to retrieve data.
5. Customize the SQL queries and responses as needed.

### Practice
Create a test database on Supabase with sample data. Use the workflow to request specific data, like "List all products sold last week," and observe how the AI agent constructs and executes the SQL query.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer AI-driven database querying services, enhancing data accessibility for clients. This capability can attract businesses seeking to streamline data analysis, opening opportunities for consulting and automation services, ultimately boosting your income potential in the AI automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
