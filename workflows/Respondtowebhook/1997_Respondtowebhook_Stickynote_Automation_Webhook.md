2. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/970dd3c6-de83-46fd-9038-33c470571390`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "301.7420425026802", height: "260.80333469825376", content: "## Webhook Trigger 
**This Node starts listening to requests to the Webhook URL**

5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "522.2493371551094", height: "109.59833265087394", content: "## Starting the Workflow
**To start the workflow paste the encoded URL into your webbrowser**

"

**Watch the image being rendered in your webbrowser**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow generates an image based on a text prompt input via a URL. It uses a webhook to receive the prompt, sends it to OpenAI's API for image generation, and returns the generated image to the user. This allows for dynamic image creation through a simple URL request.

**Demonstrate**  
A graphic design firm could use this workflow to quickly generate concept images for brainstorming sessions, providing visual inspiration based on client prompts without manual design work.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Configure the webhook URL and OpenAI API credentials.  
3. Append your text prompt to the webhook URL with "?input=" for testing.  
4. Paste the URL in a browser to trigger the workflow and generate an image.  

**Practice**  
Set up a webhook and test it with different prompts to see how the image generation varies. Try using descriptive prompts to explore the capabilities of the image generation API.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated image generation services, appealing to creative industries and enhancing your automation business portfolio. It can attract clients seeking innovative solutions and increase your revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
