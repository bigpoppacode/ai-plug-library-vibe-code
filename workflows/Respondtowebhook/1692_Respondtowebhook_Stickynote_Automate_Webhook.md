## üíº Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note1**.
2. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "681.8337349708484", height: "843.1482165886073"
3. **Webhook from Shortcut** `webhook` ‚Äî method: **POST**, path: `/shortcut-global-as`
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "469.15174499329123", height: "341.88919758842485"
5. **Switch** `switch` ‚Äî rules: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
6. **OpenAI - To Spanish** `openAi` ‚Äî modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
7. **OpenAI - To English** `openAi` ‚Äî modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
8. **OpenAI - Correct Grammar** `openAi` ‚Äî modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
9. **OpenAI - Make Shorter** `openAi` ‚Äî modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
10. **OpenAI - Make Longer** `openAi` ‚Äî modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"

## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates text processing tasks using Apple Shortcuts and OpenAI. It receives text input via a webhook triggered by a shortcut, processes the text based on the requested action (translate to English/Spanish, correct grammar, make shorter/longer), and sends the modified text back to the shortcut for replacement.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly translate or refine text content for marketing materials, ensuring consistency and saving time on manual edits.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI account.
3. Set up the Apple Shortcut to trigger the webhook with the text and desired action.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it processes and returns the modified text correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a simple Apple Shortcut to send a sample text to the workflow and test different actions (e.g., translation, grammar correction). Observe how the text is processed and returned.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer AI-powered text processing services, enhancing your product offerings and attracting clients seeking automation in content creation, ultimately boosting your income potential in the AI automation business.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
