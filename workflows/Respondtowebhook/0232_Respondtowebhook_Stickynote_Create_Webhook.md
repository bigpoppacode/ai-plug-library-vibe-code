# Respondtowebhook Stickynote Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, webhook, respondToWebhook.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Note1**.
2. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/6f7b288e-1efe-4504-a6fd-660931327269`
3. **Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "600", height: "280", content: "## Create a simple API endpoint

In this workflow we show how to create a simple API endpoint with `Webhook` and `Respond to Webhook` nodes

"
4. **Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "600", height: "220", content: "### How to use it
1. Execute the workflow so that the webhook starts listening
2. Make a test request by pasting, **in a new browser tab**, the test URL from the `Webhook` node and…[truncated]"
5. **Create URL string** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
6. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "=The URL of the Google search query for the term "{{$node["Webhook"].json["query"]["first_name"]}} {{$node["Webhook"].json["query"]["last_name"]}}" is: {{$json["product"]}}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow creates a simple API endpoint that generates a Google search URL using a person's first and last name. When a request is sent to the webhook, it captures the first and last names from the query parameters, constructs a Google search URL, and sends back a response with the generated URL.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly generate Google search links for new contacts, assisting in basic online research or verification processes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Webhook node with the provided path.
3. Execute the workflow to start listening.
4. Send a test request with query parameters like `?first_name=John&last_name=Doe`.
5. Observe the generated Google search URL as the response.

### Practice
Create a test webhook request using your browser or a tool like Postman with different names. Check the response to see if the search URL is generated correctly. Modify the names to see how the response changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help automate repetitive tasks like generating search links, saving time and effort. It enhances your service offerings in an AI automation business, potentially increasing client satisfaction and opening up new revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
