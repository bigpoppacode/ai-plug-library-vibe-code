Automates a flow using stickyNote×2, webhook, openAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **Webhook** at `POST` **/e9a97dd5-f1e7-4d5b-a6f1-be5f0c9eb96c**.
2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/e9a97dd5-f1e7-4d5b-a6f1-be5f0c9eb96c`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "620", height: "300", content: "## N8N en OpenAI image analyser"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "340", content: "## AI prompt
You are an expert financial analyst tasked with providing an advanced technical analyses of a stock or crypto currency chart provided. Your analysis will be based on v…[truncated]"

6. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.content }}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to analyze images of stock or cryptocurrency charts using OpenAI's image analysis capabilities. It begins with a Webhook that receives an image in a POST request. The image is then sent to OpenAI for analysis, where an AI model interprets the chart and provides a simple, non-binding financial analysis aimed at helping novice traders understand market movements. The analysis is returned as a text response through the Respond to Webhook node.

### Demonstrate
A financial consultant could use this workflow to provide quick, AI-generated insights on stock charts to clients, helping them make informed trading decisions without needing deep technical analysis skills.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook node to receive POST requests with image data.
3. Connect to OpenAI with your API credentials.
4. Configure the OpenAI node for image analysis.
5. Test by sending an image to the Webhook and check the response.

### Practice
Create a test using a sample stock chart image. Send it through the Webhook and observe the analysis returned by OpenAI. Modify the AI prompt to see how changes affect the analysis output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer AI-driven financial analysis services, providing value to clients by simplifying complex data into actionable insights. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new customers, and increase revenue in the AI automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
2. **Expose Webhook:** Map your external app to the listed path/method; test with curl/Postman before activation.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
