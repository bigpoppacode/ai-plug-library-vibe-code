## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This n8n workflow automates task and calendar management by using AI to handle chat inputs. It routes requests to either create tasks in Notion or manage Google Calendar events. When a chat message is received, it decides whether to create a task or schedule an event, retrieves necessary information using OpenAI, updates the relevant platform, and sends a confirmation response back to the user.

**Demonstrate**: A consultant could use this workflow to efficiently manage client appointments and project tasks. It helps in automating the scheduling of meetings and creation of tasks from client communications, ensuring nothing is missed and all actions are recorded accurately.

**Imitate**: 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your Google Calendar and Notion accounts. 3. Set up the webhook to receive chat messages. 4. Customize the task and event creation prompts. 5. Test the workflow by sending a chat message and observing the task/event creation.

**Practice**: Create a simple chat message to schedule a meeting, then observe how the workflow checks calendar availability, books the appointment, and updates you. Experiment by creating tasks in Notion through chat instructions to see how it manages task creation.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated task and calendar management services to businesses, enhancing your service offerings. It can help you attract clients looking for efficient solutions to manage their schedules and tasks, increasing your potential income in the automation sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
