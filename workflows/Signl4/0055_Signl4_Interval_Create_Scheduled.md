# SIGNL4 Interval Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **SIGNL4 Alert 2**.
2. **SIGNL4 Alert 2** `signl4` — message: "=Machine Alert: {{$node["Notion Read New"].json["Name"]}}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the process of monitoring and managing machine alerts using Notion and SIGNL4. It reads data from a Notion database at regular intervals, identifies new alerts, sends notifications through SIGNL4, and updates the Notion database based on alert status. The Function node processes alert data to determine its status and logs it for further actions.

### Demonstrate
A manufacturing company could use this workflow to monitor equipment status. When a machine fails, the workflow alerts the maintenance team via SIGNL4, ensuring quick response and minimizing downtime.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Notion and SIGNL4 accounts.
3. Configure the Notion database ID and SIGNL4 credentials.
4. Set up the interval to check for new alerts.
5. Test the workflow by simulating a machine alert in Notion.

### Practice
Create a Notion database with sample machine alerts. Run the workflow to see how it processes alerts and sends notifications. Modify the alert status in Notion and observe the workflow's response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated monitoring solutions to businesses, ensuring quick response to issues and reducing downtime. This can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, signl4Api.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
