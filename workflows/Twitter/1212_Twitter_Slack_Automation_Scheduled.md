# Twitter Slack Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Post to Slack**.
2. **Post to Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `={{$node["Setup"].parameter["values"]["string"][0]["value"]}}`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring Twitter for mentions of a specific company and posting those mentions to a designated Slack channel. Every 10 minutes, it searches Twitter for the latest mentions, filters out the relevant data, and then checks if the mentions are new since the last run. If new mentions are found, they are formatted and posted to a Slack channel, keeping the team informed of the company's online presence in real time.

### Demonstrate
Imagine a brand manager at a tech company who needs to keep track of online mentions to respond quickly to customer feedback or engagement opportunities. This workflow automates the monitoring process, ensuring they never miss a mention and can engage promptly.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Twitter and Slack accounts.
3. Set up the search term and Slack channel in the "Setup" node.
4. Activate the workflow to run every 10 minutes.
5. Test by posting a tweet mentioning your search term to see it appear in Slack.

### Practice
Create a dummy Twitter account and post tweets mentioning your company. Run the workflow and confirm the mentions appear in your Slack channel. Experiment with different search terms or Slack channels to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time social media monitoring services, enhancing your portfolio as a digital marketer or automation consultant. It helps clients stay proactive with their brand presence, potentially increasing customer engagement and satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** twitterOAuth1Api, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
