# Mortgage Rate Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Mortgage Rate Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/mortgage_rate_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "mortgage_rate_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "mortgage_rate_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of handling mortgage rate alerts. It starts with a Webhook that receives data, splits the text into manageable chunks, and creates embeddings using OpenAI. These embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database for easy querying. The workflow then queries this database to retrieve relevant information, processes the data with AI tools, and logs the results in a Google Sheet. This ensures efficient management and retrieval of mortgage rate information.

### Demonstrate
A real estate agency could use this workflow to automatically process and store incoming mortgage rate data, making it easily accessible for agents to provide clients with up-to-date information, enhancing service efficiency and client satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Webhook in n8n to receive mortgage rate data.
2. Connect Pinecone and OpenAI for embeddings and storage.
3. Configure the workflow to split, process, and store data in Google Sheets.
4. Test with sample data to ensure everything functions correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple test setup with a sample mortgage rate data input via Webhook. Run the workflow to see how data is processed, stored, and logged. Check the Google Sheet to confirm the results are recorded accurately.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data processing services to real estate clients, enhancing their operational efficiency. This can lead to new business opportunities, improved client relations, and increased revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
