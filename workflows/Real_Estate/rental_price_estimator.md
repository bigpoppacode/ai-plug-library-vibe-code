  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to estimate rental prices using AI. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, processes it by splitting and embedding the text, stores and queries the data in a vector database, and uses a language model to generate rental price estimates. The estimates are then logged in a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

**Demonstrate:**  
A real estate agency could use this workflow to automate the estimation of rental prices for properties based on data inputs. This helps in quickly providing potential clients with rental quotes, enhancing service efficiency.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive property data.
3. Connect Supabase for data storage.
4. Configure the AI model for estimation.
5. Ensure Google Sheets is set for logging results.

**Practice:**  
Create a sample property data set and trigger the workflow via the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the data and logs the estimated rental price in Google Sheets. Adjust parameters to refine accuracy.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable resource for real estate businesses looking to automate rental estimations. This can lead to consulting opportunities, helping businesses save time and improve accuracy, ultimately boosting your income in the AI automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
