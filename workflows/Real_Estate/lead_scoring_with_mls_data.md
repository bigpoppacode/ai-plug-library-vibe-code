# Lead Scoring With Mls Data
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Lead Scoring with MLS Data", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/lead_scoring_with_mls_data`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "lead_scoring_with_mls_data"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "lead_scoring_with_mls_data"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**: This workflow automates lead scoring using MLS (Multiple Listing Service) data. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, processes it by splitting text into manageable chunks, and then uses AI to generate embeddings that are stored in a vector database (Pinecone). The data is queried to assess leads, with results logged in Google Sheets for tracking and analysis.

**Demonstrate**: A real estate agency could use this workflow to automatically score potential property listings based on criteria from MLS data, helping prioritize which leads to pursue actively.

**Imitate**: 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive MLS data.
3. Connect Pinecone for vector storage.
4. Configure AI embeddings and Google Sheets for output.
5. Test the setup with sample data to ensure proper logging and scoring.

**Practice**: Create a mock MLS dataset and run the workflow. Check the Google Sheets log to verify that leads are scored accurately and efficiently. Adjust parameters to see how different inputs affect scoring.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer advanced lead scoring services to real estate clients, enhancing their sales strategy and increasing your potential service offerings. This expertise can attract more clients and generate significant income through custom automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
