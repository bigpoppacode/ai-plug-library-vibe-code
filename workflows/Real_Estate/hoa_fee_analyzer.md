3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/hoa_fee_analyzer`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "hoa_fee_analyzer"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "hoa_fee_analyzer"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the analysis of Homeowners Association (HOA) fees. It begins with receiving data via a webhook, splits the text for processing, creates embeddings to understand the content, and stores this information in a Weaviate vector database. The workflow then queries the database, processes the data using AI chat, and logs results in Google Sheets, ensuring comprehensive analysis and record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A property management company could use this workflow to automate the analysis of HOA fee structures, identifying trends and anomalies, which helps in strategic decision-making and transparent communication with homeowners.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Weaviate and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Configure the webhook to receive HOA data.
4. Customize the database index and Google Sheet to match your needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it logs analysis results correctly.

### Practice
Create a sample dataset with HOA fees and run the workflow. Observe how it processes and logs the data. Modify some parameters to see how the workflow adapts, such as changing the chunk size or embedding model.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data analysis services to real estate clients, enhancing their decision-making processes. This can lead to new business opportunities, improved client satisfaction, and increased revenue in your automation consultancy.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
