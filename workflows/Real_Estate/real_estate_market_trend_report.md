# Real Estate Market Trend Report
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Real Estate Market Trend Report", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/real_estate_market_trend_report`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "real_estate_market_trend_report"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "real_estate_market_trend_report"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the collection and processing of real estate market trend data. It starts with a webhook that receives data, splits the content into manageable chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in a Weaviate vector database. The workflow queries this database to retrieve relevant information, which is then processed by an AI agent to generate insights. Finally, the results are logged into a Google Sheet for easy access and analysis.

### Demonstrate
A real estate consultancy could use this workflow to quickly analyze market trends and generate reports for clients. By automating data collection and analysis, they can provide timely insights, enhancing decision-making and client satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Weaviate, Google Sheets, and AI credentials.
3. Set up a POST request to the webhook with real estate data.
4. Customize the splitter and embeddings to match your data structure.
5. Run the workflow to ensure data is processed and logged correctly.

### Practice
Create a test dataset of real estate information and send it to the webhook. Observe how the data is split, embedded, and stored. Check the Google Sheet for the final output and adjust parameters to fit your needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable asset in the real estate sector. By providing automated, data-driven insights, you can attract clients, improve service offerings, and increase revenue streams with minimal manual effort.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
