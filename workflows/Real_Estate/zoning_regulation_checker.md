# Zoning Regulation Checker
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Zoning Regulation Checker", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/zoning_regulation_checker`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "zoning_regulation_checker"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "zoning_regulation_checker"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking zoning regulations. It starts by receiving data through a Webhook, splits the input text into manageable chunks, and generates embeddings using OpenAI. These embeddings are stored in a Redis vector store. The workflow then queries this data to retrieve relevant zoning information, processes it with a language model, and logs the outcomes in a Google Sheet for easy reference.

### Demonstrate
A real estate consultant could use this workflow to quickly verify zoning regulations for different properties, ensuring compliance and saving time on manual research. This increases efficiency and accuracy in property analysis.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Webhook to receive zoning queries.
3. Connect Redis and OpenAI accounts.
4. Customize Google Sheets to log results.
5. Test by sending zoning regulation queries through the Webhook.

### Practice
Create a mock property zoning check by entering sample data into the Webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the information and logs it into Google Sheets. Modify the input to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated zoning checks as a service, improving your efficiency and appeal to real estate clients. This can enhance your offerings and increase your income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, redisApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
