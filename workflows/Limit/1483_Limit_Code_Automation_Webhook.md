# Limit Code Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
  2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "743.6780104712059", height: "420.4319371727753", content: "## Resolve Chrome Extensions which are tracked by Linkedin

**Linkedin tracks which Chrome extensions are installed in your browser.**  This workflow uses a huge JSON of chrome ext…[truncated]"
4. **Set extension IDs var** `code` — jsCode: "[redacted]"
5. **Load already processed items** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
6. **Exclude processed items** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", joinMode: "keepNonMatches"
7. **Limit** `limit` — maxItems: "200"

  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
