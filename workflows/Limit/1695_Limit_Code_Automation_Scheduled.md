# Limit Code Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Cron Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Gemini** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-001"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "420", height: "540", content: "## GitHub Releases Config
- Edit the JavaScript array within this node's code area.
- Modify or add the repositories you want to follow. Each repository object needs a `name` (cust…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "260", height: "340", content: "## Cron Trigger
Adjust the `Rule` setting to change the update check frequency (default is `0 */10 9-23 * * *`, checking every 10 minutes between 9 AM and 11 PM daily)."
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "380", height: "580", content: "## Gemini (AI Model)
- Select your configured Google Gemini credentials.
- (Optional) Replace with a different supported AI model node and select its credentials.

7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — height: "380", content: "## Send Message
Slack Notifications
- Select your configured Slack credentials in both Slack nodes.
- Set the target `Channel ID` for notifications."
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — height: "340", content: "














## Send Error
- Select your configured Slack credentials in both Slack nodes.
- Set the target `Channel ID` for notifications."
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "900", content: "[redacted]"
10. **GitHub Config** `code` — jsCode: "return [

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors GitHub repositories for new releases using a Cron Trigger. It retrieves repository data from GitHub, checks for new releases, and processes the release notes using an AI model (Gemini) to extract relevant information. The workflow then formats this information and sends notifications via Slack, ensuring that team members are promptly informed about updates.

### Demonstrate
A software development company could use this workflow to automatically track updates to libraries or tools they depend on. This ensures developers are always aware of important updates, which can improve project stability and security by keeping dependencies up to date.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GitHub and Slack accounts.
3. Edit the GitHub Config node to include repositories you want to monitor.
4. Adjust the Cron Trigger settings for your desired check frequency.
5. Test the workflow by running it manually to ensure notifications are sent correctly.

### Practice
Create a test repository on GitHub and make a release. Use the workflow to track this repository and observe how it processes the release and sends a notification. Adjust the repository list and Cron settings to see how changes affect the workflow execution.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer monitoring and notification services to clients, ensuring they are always updated with the latest software changes. This adds value to your services, enhances client trust, and opens opportunities for upselling additional automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, googlePalmApi, redis.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
