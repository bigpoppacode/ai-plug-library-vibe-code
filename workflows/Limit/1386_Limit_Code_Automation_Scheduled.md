# Limit Code Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule trigger (1 min)** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "420.4803040774015", height: "189.69151356225348"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "451.41125086385614", height: "313.3056033573073", content: "### Schedule trigger and get emails

8. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — width: "461.3148409669012", height: "314.75072291501283", content: "### Build and encode message
Create raw message in RFC standard and encode it into base64 string (please see [Gmail API reference](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference…[truncated]"
9. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — width: "219.88389496558554", height: "314.75072291501283", content: "### Insert reply draft
Add reply draft from OpenAI Assistant to specific Gmail thread."
10. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — width: "219.88389496558554", height: "314.75072291501283", content: "### Remove label

12. **Sticky Note11** `stickyNote` — width: "470.88389496558545", height: "314.75072291501283", content: "### Get last message from thread
Return all messages for a single thread and pass for further processing only the last one."
13. **Get threads with specific labels** `gmail` — resource: **thread**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates email management by monitoring Gmail threads with specific labels, retrieving the last message, and generating a reply using OpenAI. The reply is converted to HTML, encoded, and saved as a draft in the Gmail thread. It runs every minute, ensuring timely email responses.
  
- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently manage customer inquiries, ensuring each email is responded to promptly with AI-generated content, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing manual workload.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your Gmail and OpenAI accounts. 3. Set up trigger labels in Gmail. 4. Customize the OpenAI prompt to suit your business needs. 5. Test the workflow with a labeled email thread to ensure it drafts replies correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a test Gmail account, label some emails, and run the workflow. Observe how it generates and drafts email replies. Adjust the OpenAI prompt to see how different inputs affect the generated content.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated email response services, increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction. This skill can attract clients seeking to streamline their communication processes, boosting your income as an AI automation consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
