# Limit Code Send Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "260", height: "220"
4. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "150", height: "80"
5. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — inputSource: "passthrough"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "150", height: "80"
7. **Sticky Note10** `stickyNote` — width: "340", height: "220", content: "## Send complete message"
8. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "370", height: "480"
9. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "390", height: "480"
10. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "620", height: "300"
11. **Sticky Note11** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "620", height: "280"
12. **Sticky Note12** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "280", content: "## 取得 Google Drive 現有的檔案資訊
## Get Google Drive existing file info👇"
13. **Sticky Note13** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "320", height: "280"
14. **Sticky Note14** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "760", height: "80"
15. **Get all n8n Workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
16. **Workflow Data** `executionData` — configured for its default action.
17. **Parameters** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
18. **getDriveFileData** `googleDrive` — resource: **fileFolder**
19. **ifDriveEmpty** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
20. **CodeJsonToFile1** `code` — jsCode: "return items.map(item => {
  const jsonData = JSON.stringify( $('Workflow Data').item.json);
  const binaryData = Buffer.from(jsonData).toString('base64');
  item.binary = {
    da…[truncated]"
21. **firstWorkflowJson** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "={{ $('Workflow Data').item.json.toJsonString() }}
"
22. **Backup to Google Drive2** `googleDrive` — operation: **update**
23. **JsonToFile** `code` — jsCode: "return items.map(item => {
  const jsonData = JSON.stringify(item.json);
  const binaryData = Buffer.from(jsonData).toString('base64');
  item.binary = {
    data: {
      data: bi…[truncated]"
24. **Backup to Google Drive4** `googleDrive` — name: "={{  $('Workflow Data').item.json.name + "_" + $('Workflow Data').item.json.id+ ".json"}}", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
25. **failureEmail** `gmail` — sendTo: "your email address", message: "={{ $now }} {{ $('Workflow Data').item.json.name }} workflow backup .", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup of n8n workflows to Google Drive. It is triggered on a schedule, retrieves all existing workflows from n8n, converts them to JSON format, and checks if the workflow file already exists in Google Drive. If it does, it updates the file; if not, it uploads a new file. Success or failure notifications are sent via email and Discord.

### Demonstrate
A business owner uses this workflow to ensure all automation workflows are securely backed up to Google Drive daily. This prevents data loss and ensures quick recovery in case of system failure, maintaining business continuity.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google Drive and Gmail credentials.
3. Configure the schedule trigger for desired backup frequency.
4. Customize Google Drive folder settings in the workflow.
5. Test the workflow to ensure backups are created and notifications are sent.

### Practice
Create a small n8n workflow and run this backup workflow to see it saved in Google Drive. Modify the workflow, run the backup again, and verify the update in Google Drive. Test notifications by intentionally causing a failure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps ensure data security for clients, adding value to your automation services. Offering reliable backup solutions can enhance your reputation and lead to more client retention, increasing your business's profitability.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, googleDriveOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2, discordBotApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
