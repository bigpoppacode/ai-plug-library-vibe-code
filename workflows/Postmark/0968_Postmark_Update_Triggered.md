  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to monitor email activity using Postmark. It triggers whenever an email is either bounced or opened. Upon detecting these events, it captures the details, including the email content, which can be used for further processing or analysis. This workflow helps businesses stay informed about their email engagement and deliverability issues.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to track email marketing campaign performance. By understanding which emails are opened and which bounce, the business can improve their email list quality and crafting strategies to increase engagement and reduce bounce rates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Postmark account and connect it to n8n.
3. Configure the Postmark Trigger to monitor "bounce" and "open" events.
4. Test the workflow by sending emails and observing the triggered events.
5. Customize actions to be taken once an event is triggered, like logging data or alerting a team.

### Practice
Create a test email list and send a campaign. Use the workflow to track which emails are opened or bounced. Experiment with different subject lines or content to see how it affects open rates and bounce rates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer email performance monitoring services, enhancing your clients' marketing strategies. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, more business opportunities, and a competitive edge in the automation industry.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
