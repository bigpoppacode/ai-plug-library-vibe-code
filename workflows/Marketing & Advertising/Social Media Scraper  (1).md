## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating and sharing AI-generated avatar videos based on trending news articles. It fetches news, generates a script, creates a video, and publishes it across multiple social media platforms.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly produce and share engaging video content about trending topics, saving time on content creation and ensuring they stay relevant in the fast-paced digital landscape.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up API keys for Blotato and OpenAI.
3. Modify the scheduling trigger to your preferred frequency.
4. Adjust social media account IDs and other parameters in the "Prepare for Publish" node.
5. Execute the workflow and monitor the results.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that only fetches one trending news article and generates a short summary using OpenAI. Experiment with different prompts to see how the output varies.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable content creation services, helping businesses enhance their online presence. As a result, you can attract clients seeking to automate their marketing efforts and generate income through your automation expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Upload to Blotato" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
