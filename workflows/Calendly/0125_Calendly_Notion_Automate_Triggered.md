# Calendly Notion Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Calendly Trigger**.
  2. **Calendly Trigger** `calendlyTrigger` — events: "invitee.created"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of capturing new meeting invitees from Calendly, enriching their data using Dropcontact, and storing the information in a Notion database. When someone books a meeting via Calendly, their details are enhanced with additional information like LinkedIn profiles and websites, and then logged into Notion for record-keeping and further action.

**Demonstrate:**  
A consultant could use this workflow to automatically gather enriched details about potential clients who book meetings via Calendly. This saves time on data entry and ensures they have comprehensive information about the client before the meeting.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Calendly, Dropcontact, and Notion accounts.
3. Set up a trigger for new meeting bookings.
4. Map the required fields in Notion to capture the enriched data.
5. Test the workflow by booking a test meeting via Calendly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test meeting in Calendly, then check if the enriched data appears correctly in Notion. Modify the LinkedIn or website fields in the Dropcontact node to see how the changes reflect in Notion.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow helps you automate client onboarding, providing enriched client data effortlessly. This can enhance client interactions, streamline operations, and allow you to offer high-value automation services, increasing income potential in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, dropcontactApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
