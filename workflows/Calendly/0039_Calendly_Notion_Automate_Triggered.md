  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

  2. **Notion** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically updates a Notion database whenever a new invitee is created in Calendly. When someone schedules an appointment via Calendly, their name and email are captured and added to a Notion database page, ensuring that your records are always up-to-date without manual data entry.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to keep track of client meetings. Each time a client books a meeting through Calendly, their details are automatically logged in Notion, providing a seamless way to manage appointments and client information.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Calendly and Notion accounts.
3. Configure the Calendly trigger to detect new invitees.
4. Map the invitee's name and email to the appropriate fields in your Notion database.
5. Test the workflow by scheduling a dummy meeting on Calendly.

### Practice
Create a test Notion database and a test Calendly event. Run the workflow by booking a test appointment through Calendly. Check your Notion database to ensure the new invitee's details are correctly added.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate client data entry, saving time and reducing errors. This skill can help attract clients looking for efficient appointment management solutions, enhancing your service offerings and increasing potential revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** calendlyApi, notionApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
