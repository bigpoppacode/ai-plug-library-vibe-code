# Send Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Simple Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
4. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
5. **SerpAPI** `toolSerpApi` — options: "[object Object]"
6. **AI Agent** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to process incoming chat messages using AI for enhanced interaction. When a chat message is received, the workflow uses an AI agent, which integrates memory for context, the OpenAI model for generating responses, and SerpAPI for performing web searches if needed. This allows for dynamic and informed responses in real-time chat scenarios.

### Demonstrate
A customer support team could use this workflow to provide instant, intelligent responses to customer inquiries, enhancing user experience and reducing response time by leveraging AI for quick information retrieval and generation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI and SerpAPI accounts.
3. Set up the chat trigger to listen for incoming messages.
4. Customize the memory and AI agent settings to tailor responses.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample chat messages and observing AI responses.

### Practice
Create a simple chat interface, connect it to the workflow, and experiment with different types of queries. Observe how AI handles each query, and tweak the workflow to improve response accuracy and relevance.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer AI-enhanced chat services to clients, improving their customer support operations. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and potential upsells, enhancing your value proposition in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, serpApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
