## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of researching meeting attendees who book via Calendly. It collects booking details, uses AI to analyze goals and generate a prep report, and sends an email with the research findings and an audio summary.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline pre-meeting preparations. For example, after a client schedules a meeting through Calendly, the owner receives detailed insights about the client and their company, enhancing the meeting's effectiveness and professionalism.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Set up a Calendly Trigger node to capture booking data.
3. Add nodes to extract attendee details, research using an AI API, and analyze meeting goals.
4. Use a Gmail node to send the compiled report and audio summary.
5. Test the workflow by scheduling a mock meeting on Calendly.

### Practice
Try adapting this workflow to send personalized follow-up emails after meetings. Capture the meeting notes, summarize key points, and send a thank-you email with insights based on the discussion.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable services to clients, enhancing their meeting effectiveness and saving time. This can lead to new business opportunities, increased client satisfaction, and potential income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Workflow Overview" and "Assemble Email Package" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
