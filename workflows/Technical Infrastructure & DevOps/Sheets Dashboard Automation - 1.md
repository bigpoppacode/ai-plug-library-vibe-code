## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring changes in a Google Sheet. When specific columns are updated, it sends an email notification or makes an HTTP request, streamlining communication and data handling.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically notify their sales team when a lead's status changes in a Google Sheet. This ensures timely follow-ups, improving lead conversion rates.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Webhook node to trigger the workflow.
3. Set up a Switch node to check which column was updated (e.g., columns 7, 8, or 9).
4. Use a Filter node to only proceed if a specific condition is met (e.g., value is TRUE).
5. Add a Gmail node for sending notifications or an HTTP Request node for API calls.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send a notification for a different column update. Change the conditions in the Switch node to track a new column and test it by updating the Google Sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate notifications and data handling in real-time, enhancing your value as a consultant or business owner. This can lead to improved client satisfaction, faster response times, and ultimately, increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
