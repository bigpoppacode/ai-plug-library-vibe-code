# Notion GoogleDrive Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On file upload**.
  2. **On file upload** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
3. **Create database page** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of tracking file uploads to a specific Google Drive folder. When a new file is added, the workflow triggers and creates a new page in a Notion database. The Notion page includes the file's name and a link to access it, effectively keeping a log of file uploads in Notion.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to maintain an organized record of all files uploaded by team members in a shared drive, ensuring that every document is accounted for and easily accessible through Notion.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Drive and Notion accounts.
3. Set the Google Drive folder to monitor.
4. Specify the Notion database where pages will be created.
5. Test by uploading a file to the monitored folder.

### Practice
Create a test folder on Google Drive and a test database in Notion. Upload a few files to the Google Drive folder and observe how the workflow logs each file in Notion. Adjust settings to customize the information saved.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated document tracking services, improving organization for clients. This enhances your portfolio in the automation business, potentially leading to increased client engagement and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, notionApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
