# GitLab Filter Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using gitlab×4, stickyNote×4, set×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Backup Now - Manual Trigger**.
  2. **Backup Now - Manual Trigger** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "401", height: "246"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "398", height: "240"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "598", height: "384.41789416257484", content: "## Decide Whether to Create or Edit or Skip"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "402", height: "452"
7. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
8. **Globals** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Fetch List of Existing Files** `gitlab` — resource: **file**, operation: **list**
10. **Combine Gitlab Existing Files as Single List Item** `aggregate` — options: "[object Object]", fieldsToAggregate: "[object Object]"
11. **n8n** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"
12. **Derive Filename From Workflow Name** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **File Exists in Gitlab?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
14. **Fetch Existing File Content** `gitlab` — resource: **file**, operation: **get**
15. **Create New File(s)** `gitlab` — resource: **file**
16. **Skip Unchanged Files** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
17. **Edit Existing File(s)** `gitlab` — resource: **file**, operation: **edit**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates the backup of n8n workflows to GitLab. It checks if a workflow file already exists in the GitLab repository. If it does, the workflow checks for changes and updates the file if needed. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file. This ensures that all workflows are regularly backed up and managed efficiently.

- **Demonstrate:** A developer could use this workflow to automatically back up their n8n workflows to a GitLab repository, ensuring they have a version history and can easily restore or track changes over time.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into your n8n instance. Connect your GitLab account. Configure the necessary GitLab repository and file paths. Set the schedule or trigger for when you want the backups to occur. Test the workflow to ensure it creates and updates files correctly.

- **Practice:** Set up a test GitLab repository and run the workflow with a few sample n8n workflows. Experiment by making changes to the workflows and observe how the backup process updates the files in GitLab.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated backup solutions to clients, adding value to your services. It ensures data integrity and version control, which are crucial for businesses relying on automation workflows, enhancing your credibility as a reliable service provider.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, gitlabApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
