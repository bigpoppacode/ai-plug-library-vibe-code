# GitLab Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using gitlabTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Gitlab Trigger**.
  2. **Gitlab Trigger** `gitlabTrigger` — owner: "n8n-io", events: "*", repository: "n8n-docs"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow uses a GitLab Trigger to automatically start a process whenever any event occurs in the "n8n-docs" repository owned by "n8n-io". It is designed to monitor all activities in the repository, such as code pushes, merges, or issues, allowing for real-time updates and automation based on repository changes.

- **Demonstrate**: A developer working on the n8n documentation could use this workflow to automatically trigger notifications or updates whenever changes are made to the documentation repository. This ensures that the team stays informed about the latest updates, improving collaboration and version control.

- **Imitate**: To apply this workflow, clone it into your n8n environment. Connect your GitLab account and adjust the trigger settings to your repository and desired events. Test it with a sample event to ensure it triggers as expected.

- **Practice**: Set up a similar workflow in your n8n instance, but instead of monitoring all events, configure it to trigger only on merge requests. Observe how it responds when you create a new merge request in your GitLab repository.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline project management and improve team communication by automating notifications and updates. This can enhance your service offerings in an AI automation business, attracting clients who need efficient project oversight and management tools.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
