# GitLab Code Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×6, noOp×4, gitlab×3.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test Workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Test Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "839.0943396226413", height: "587.9245283018865", content: "## Check file
Get the file.
Use error output as normal output.
Some code to analyse the file and set a status."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "720.3234501347711", height: "806.2533692722375", content: "## Save the data
Save the data as new or edited file, ignored or note as error."
5. **Globals** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
6. **Retrieve all workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing workflows stored in a GitLab repository. It retrieves all workflows, compares each one with its corresponding file in GitLab, and updates or creates files based on differences. It checks for new, same, or different versions and updates the GitLab repository accordingly.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing multiple workflow versions in GitLab can use this workflow to automate the synchronization of workflow changes, ensuring that the latest versions are always saved in the repository.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your GitLab account in n8n.
3. Set up the necessary repository details in the "Globals" node.
4. Run the workflow and observe how it checks and updates workflows in GitLab.

### Practice
Create a test GitLab repository with a few workflow files. Run the workflow to see how it identifies new, same, and different versions. Modify some workflows in GitLab and rerun the workflow to observe changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to efficiently manage and synchronize workflow versions in repositories, offering version control services to clients. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract new customers, and increase your value as an automation consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** gitlabApi, n8nApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
