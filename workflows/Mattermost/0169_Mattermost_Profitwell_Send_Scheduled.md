  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of sending monthly financial metrics from ProfitWell to a Mattermost channel. It uses a Cron node to trigger the workflow at 9 AM every month. The ProfitWell node retrieves financial data such as the number of active customers, new customers, growth rate, and recurring revenue. This data is then formatted into a message and sent to a specified Mattermost channel, keeping the team informed about key financial metrics without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A SaaS company could use this workflow to automatically update their team on customer metrics and financial growth each month, enabling the team to make informed decisions based on the latest data.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your ProfitWell and Mattermost accounts.
3. Set the Cron node to your preferred monthly schedule.
4. Customize the Mattermost message to include the metrics relevant to your needs.
5. Activate the workflow to start receiving updates.

### Practice
Create a test Mattermost channel and run the workflow manually to see how the data is presented. Adjust the message format and content to better suit your team's requirements, ensuring clarity and relevance.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate financial reporting, saving time and ensuring consistency. This capability can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and boost your automation business by providing valuable insights with minimal effort.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** profitWellApi, mattermostApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
