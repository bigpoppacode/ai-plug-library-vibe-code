# Mattermost Webhook Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using webhook, set, mattermost.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Mattermost**.
  2. **Mattermost** `mattermost` — message: "=Join me in a video call:", channelId: "={{$node["Webhook"].json["body"]["channel_id"]}}", attachments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending a Mattermost message to initiate a video call. It starts with a webhook that captures the channel ID from an incoming request. The workflow then prepares a message and constructs a video call link using the username from the request. Finally, it sends a personalized invitation to join a video call in the specified Mattermost channel.

### Demonstrate
A remote team leader could use this workflow to automatically send video call invitations to their team on Mattermost whenever a new meeting is scheduled, ensuring everyone has the correct link and details without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to trigger on meeting scheduling.
3. Customize the video call link generation with your preferred service.
4. Connect your Mattermost account.
5. Test by scheduling a meeting to see the invitation sent to the channel.

### Practice
Create a test webhook in n8n and simulate sending a POST request with test data. Check Mattermost to see if the video call invitation is correctly posted, ensuring the link and message are formatted as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated communication solutions, enhancing team collaboration and efficiency. It adds value to your services by reducing manual tasks and ensuring timely communication, potentially increasing client satisfaction and retention.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
