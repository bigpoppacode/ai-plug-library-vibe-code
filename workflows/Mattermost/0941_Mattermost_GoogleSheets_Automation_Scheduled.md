# Mattermost GoogleSheets Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Read data on Google Sheets**.
  2. **Read data on Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — sheet: `sheetID`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending daily Instagram statistics to a Mattermost channel. Every morning at 8 AM, it retrieves the current date, reads Instagram data from a Google Sheet, and sends a formatted message with the account name, follower count, and post count to a specified Mattermost channel.

### Demonstrate
A social media manager could use this workflow to automatically update their team with daily Instagram statistics, ensuring everyone is informed and aligned on the account's performance without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Mattermost accounts.
3. Set the Google Sheet ID and the Mattermost channel ID.
4. Schedule the workflow to run daily at 8 AM.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends the correct data to Mattermost.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with sample Instagram data. Run the workflow manually to see how the data is formatted and sent to Mattermost. Modify the message template in the Mattermost node to customize the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated social media reporting services to clients, saving them time and enhancing their team communication. This skill can increase your value as a consultant and potentially generate recurring revenue from automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mattermostApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
