# Mattermost Typeform Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using mattermost, noOp, if.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Typeform Trigger**.
  2. **Typeform Trigger** `typeformTrigger` — formId: "DuJHEGW5"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing feedback collected via a Typeform survey. When a form is submitted, it triggers AWS Comprehend to analyze the sentiment of the feedback. If the sentiment is negative, a message is sent to a Mattermost channel, including the feedback details and sentiment score. This helps quickly identify and address negative feedback.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor customer feedback from events. If negative feedback is detected, it alerts the team on Mattermost, enabling prompt response and service improvement.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Typeform and AWS Comprehend accounts.
3. Set up Mattermost credentials.
4. Customize the Typeform form ID and Mattermost channel ID.
5. Test the workflow with sample feedback to ensure it triggers correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform survey and submit feedback. Observe how the workflow processes the input, analyzes sentiment, and sends notifications based on the sentiment detected. Modify feedback to test different sentiment outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing automated sentiment analysis solutions. This can help businesses improve customer satisfaction and retention, ultimately increasing your value as a consultant or service provider.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mattermostApi, aws, typeformApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
