# Mattermost GoogleSheets Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Execute every 45 mins**.
  2. **Execute every 45 mins** `interval` — unit: "minutes"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically checks a Google Sheet every 45 minutes for new data entries. If new entries are found, it sends a notification through Mattermost with details like ID, Name, and Email of the new entries. This ensures that you are promptly informed of updates in your Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor a shared Google Sheet for new customer inquiries. By receiving timely notifications, they can quickly respond to potential leads, improving customer engagement and satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Mattermost accounts.
3. Set the Google Sheet ID and configure the Mattermost message format.
4. Activate the workflow to run every 45 minutes.
5. Test by adding new data to the Google Sheet and check for notifications.

### Practice
Create a small Google Sheet with sample data. Set up the workflow and add new entries to the sheet. Verify that Mattermost notifications are sent only for new entries. Adjust the message format to include additional data fields if needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time data monitoring services, helping clients stay updated on critical data changes. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and increase revenue by providing valuable automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mattermostApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
