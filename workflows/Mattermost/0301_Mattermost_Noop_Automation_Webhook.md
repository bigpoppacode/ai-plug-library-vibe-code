  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to promote gender-inclusive language on a Mattermost chat platform. It listens for messages containing gender-specific terms like "guys," "gals," or "dudes" via a webhook. If such terms are detected, it sends a suggestion message to the same channel, encouraging the use of more inclusive terms like "folks" or "y'all."

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to automatically encourage inclusive language in team communications, fostering a more respectful and welcoming workplace culture.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook node to listen for incoming messages.
3. Configure an IF node to detect specific gendered terms.
4. Connect to Mattermost and set up a message response.
5. Test with sample messages to ensure it triggers correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Mattermost channel and post messages containing the target gendered terms. Observe how the workflow responds with inclusive language suggestions and tweak the terms list as needed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you offer solutions that enhance workplace inclusivity, a growing priority for many companies. This can differentiate your services, attracting clients seeking to improve their organizational culture and communication practices.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
