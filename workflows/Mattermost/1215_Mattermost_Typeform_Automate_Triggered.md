  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of analyzing feedback from a Typeform survey. It triggers when a form is submitted, uses AWS Comprehend to analyze the sentiment of the feedback, checks if the sentiment is negative, and if so, sends a notification to a Mattermost channel with the feedback details and sentiment score. If the sentiment is not negative, no further action is taken.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor customer feedback from events. If negative feedback is detected, the team is immediately notified via Mattermost, allowing them to address issues promptly and improve customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform and AWS Comprehend accounts.
3. Set your Mattermost channel ID in the Mattermost node.
4. Customize the Typeform form ID to match your survey.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a form and checking Mattermost for notifications.

### Practice
Create a simple Typeform survey with a question about an event. Run the workflow and submit feedback through the form. Observe how negative feedback triggers a message in Mattermost. Experiment with different sentiments to see how the workflow responds.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you offer sentiment analysis services, enhancing customer feedback management for clients. This can lead to improved customer relations and opens opportunities for upselling additional automation solutions, boosting your business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mattermostApi, aws, typeformApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
