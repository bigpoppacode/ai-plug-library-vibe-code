# Mattermost PagerDuty Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using webhook, pagerDuty, mattermost.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Mattermost**.
  2. **Mattermost** `mattermost` — message: "💪🏼 Incident status has been changed to Acknowledged on PagerDuty.", channelId: "={{$node["Webhook"].json["body"]["channel_id"]}}", attachments: ""
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of acknowledging an incident on PagerDuty and notifying a Mattermost channel. When an incident is reported, a webhook triggers the workflow. It updates the incident status to "Acknowledged" on PagerDuty and sends a confirmation message to a specified Mattermost channel, keeping the team informed.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to ensure their IT team is promptly informed about incident acknowledgments, improving response times and coordination during system outages.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook URL in your application to trigger this workflow.
3. Configure your PagerDuty and Mattermost credentials in n8n.
4. Test the workflow by triggering the webhook and checking if the Mattermost message is sent.

### Practice
Create a test incident in PagerDuty, trigger the webhook, and verify that the incident status changes to "Acknowledged" and a message is posted in Mattermost. Modify the channel ID to test different notification channels.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide real-time incident updates to your team, improving operational efficiency. As a consultant, you can offer this as a service to clients, enhancing their incident management processes and potentially increasing your revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** pagerDutyApi, mattermostApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
