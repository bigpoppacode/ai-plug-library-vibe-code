# Mattermost Lemlist Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using lemlistTrigger, mattermost.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Mattermost**.
  2. **Mattermost** `mattermost` — message: "={{$json["firstName"]}} has replied back to your {{$json["campaignName"]}}. Below is the reply:

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates notifications when a reply to an email campaign is detected. It listens for replies to specific campaigns in Lemlist and sends a notification message to a designated Mattermost channel, including the respondent's name and their message content. This helps teams stay informed about campaign interactions in real-time.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep their sales team updated about customer interactions. When a prospect replies to an email campaign, the sales team is immediately notified in their Mattermost channel, enabling prompt follow-up actions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Lemlist and Mattermost credentials in n8n.
3. Configure the Lemlist Trigger with your campaign ID.
4. Adjust the Mattermost Node to point to your channel ID.
5. Test the workflow by sending a reply to the campaign.

### Practice
Create a test Lemlist campaign and send a reply to it. Observe how the notification is sent to the Mattermost channel, and experiment with customizing the message format or channel destination.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time campaign response updates to clients, enhancing their customer engagement strategies. This skill can differentiate your service offerings, attracting more clients and increasing revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** lemlistApi, mattermostApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
