  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow captures feedback from a Typeform and analyzes its sentiment using Google Cloud Natural Language. If the sentiment score meets certain criteria, it sends a message to a Mattermost channel with the feedback and its sentiment score. If not, it takes no further action.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor customer feedback received through Typeform surveys. Positive or negative feedback could trigger different actions, such as notifying a team on Mattermost to address issues or celebrate successes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Typeform and Mattermost accounts.
3. Set up a Typeform with a feedback question.
4. Configure Google Cloud Natural Language API.
5. Define conditions in the IF node to decide when to send a Mattermost message.

### Practice
Create a Typeform survey for event feedback. Use the workflow to analyze responses, sending notifications only for feedback with extreme sentiment scores. Test with various sample feedback entries to see how the workflow reacts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer sentiment analysis and real-time feedback monitoring services to clients, enhancing their customer experience management. This can increase client satisfaction, retention, and open opportunities for upselling advanced automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, googleCloudNaturalLanguageOAuth2Api, mattermostApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
