  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching recent tweets containing the keyword "n8n_io" every minute, checks for new tweets, and sends a notification to a Mattermost channel. It formats the tweet details, including the tweet text, author's name, profile picture, and a link to the tweet, ensuring real-time updates in the team chat.

### Demonstrate
A social media manager could use this workflow to keep the team updated about the latest mentions of their brand or product on Twitter, facilitating prompt engagement and response to public discussions.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Twitter and Mattermost accounts.
3. Adjust the search keyword in the Twitter node as needed.
4. Set up your Mattermost channel details.
5. Activate the workflow to start receiving live updates.

### Practice
Create a test Twitter account and make a few tweets with a specific keyword. Set up the workflow to track this keyword and observe how it delivers notifications to your Mattermost channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time social media monitoring services to clients, enhancing their engagement strategy and potentially increasing their market reach. This capability can be a valuable addition to your AI automation business, attracting more clients and generating income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
