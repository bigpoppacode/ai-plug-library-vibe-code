# Mattermost GoogleSheets Automate Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Mattermost**.
  2. **Mattermost** `mattermost` — message: "= Hey @channel, we hope you had a great time at **{{$node["Google Sheets"].json["Session"]}}**.
Let us know how we did by sharing your feedback with us on the link below!", channelId: "={{$node["Google Sheets"].json["Mattermost Channel ID"]}}", attachments: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to send a message on Mattermost, reminding users to provide feedback after a session. It starts by triggering at a scheduled time using the Cron node. The workflow then retrieves session details and Mattermost channel information from a Google Sheets document. Finally, it sends a customized message to the specified Mattermost channel, including a link to a feedback form.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically remind team members to submit feedback after a monthly meeting, ensuring continuous improvement and engagement without manual follow-ups.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Mattermost accounts.
3. Set up a Cron trigger with your desired schedule.
4. Ensure your Google Sheets document is properly formatted with session details and channel IDs.
5. Test the workflow to confirm it sends messages correctly.

### Practice
Create a mock Google Sheets document with session names and Mattermost channel IDs. Run the workflow and verify that it sends a test message to your Mattermost channel, prompting feedback.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate reminders and feedback collection, enhancing team communication and process improvement. This skill can be offered as a valuable service to businesses looking to streamline their feedback loops, potentially generating income through consulting or SaaS offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, mattermostApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
