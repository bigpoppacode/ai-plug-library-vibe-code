  ### Explain
This workflow is designed to notify a Mattermost channel whenever the workflow itself is updated. It uses a workflow trigger to detect updates and sends a message via Mattermost, allowing teams to stay informed about changes to their automation processes.

### Demonstrate
A development team could use this workflow to ensure everyone is aware of updates to critical automation workflows, preventing miscommunication and ensuring all team members are aligned with the latest changes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Mattermost credentials.
3. Set the workflow to trigger on updates.
4. Customize the Mattermost channel ID.
5. Test by making a change to the workflow and observing the notification.

### Practice
Create a test workflow and set it to update a message in Mattermost when it changes. Experiment with different updates to see how the workflow responds each time.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to manage and communicate workflow changes effectively, improving team collaboration and operational efficiency. This skill can boost your value as an automation consultant, potentially leading to new opportunities and increased income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mattermostApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
