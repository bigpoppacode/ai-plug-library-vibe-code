# Mattermost PagerDuty Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using mattermost×7, webhook×3, jira×2.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Mattermost7**.
  2. **Mattermost7** `mattermost` — message: "=🎉 The incident ({{$node["PagerDuty2"].json["summary"]}}) was resolved by the lovely folks in the on-call team!", channelId: "qwertz12345", attachments: ""
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates incident management by integrating PagerDuty, Jira, and Mattermost. It starts with a webhook for new incidents, creates a Jira issue, and sends notifications in Mattermost. When incidents are acknowledged or resolved in PagerDuty, the workflow updates Jira and notifies the relevant Mattermost channels about the status change.

### Demonstrate
A company could use this workflow to streamline their IT incident management process. When an incident occurs, it automatically creates a Jira ticket, notifies the team in Mattermost, and updates everyone when the incident is acknowledged or resolved, saving time and ensuring everyone is informed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Jira, PagerDuty, and Mattermost accounts.
3. Customize webhook URLs for incident triggers.
4. Set up your channels and project details in the workflow.
5. Test by simulating an incident and observing the notifications and updates.

### Practice
Set up a test environment with a mock incident in PagerDuty. Run the workflow to see how it creates a Jira issue and sends notifications in Mattermost. Experiment by acknowledging and resolving the incident to see the workflow's response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient incident management solutions. This can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and increase revenue by offering automated, real-time communication and coordination for IT operations.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** jiraSoftwareCloudApi, pagerDutyApi, mattermostApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
