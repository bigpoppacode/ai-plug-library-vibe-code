  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the analysis of feedback collected via a Typeform survey. It uses Google Cloud Natural Language to assess the sentiment of the feedback. Based on the sentiment score, it either sends a message to a Mattermost channel or performs a no-operation (NoOp), indicating no further action is taken.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor customer feedback from events. Positive feedback can be shared with the team instantly on Mattermost, helping to boost morale and inform strategy.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Typeform, Google Cloud, and Mattermost accounts.
3. Set up Typeform to collect feedback.
4. Customize the Mattermost message settings.
5. Test with sample feedback to ensure it works as expected.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Typeform survey to collect feedback. Run the workflow with different feedback sentiments and observe how it routes messages to Mattermost based on sentiment scores.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated sentiment analysis services to clients, enhancing their customer feedback processes. This can lead to new consulting opportunities and additional revenue streams by providing real-time insights into customer satisfaction.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
