  ## ⚙️ How It Works

  2. **Send calendar invites** `googleCalendar` — end: "2020-12-17T18:38:49.000Z", start: "2020-12-17T18:08:49.000Z", calendar: "Enter Your Google Calendar"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates the process of organizing virtual coffee chats for employees. Every Monday, it collects a list of employees from a Mattermost channel, randomly divides them into groups of three, announces these groups on Mattermost, and sends Google Calendar invites for a virtual meeting. This ensures regular team interactions, fostering a collaborative work environment.

**Demonstrate:**  
A remote company could use this workflow to encourage team bonding and maintain a strong company culture by scheduling regular informal meetups among employees.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Mattermost and Google Calendar accounts.  
3. Set your Mattermost channel ID and Google Calendar details.  
4. Test the workflow by manually executing it to ensure it divides employees and sends invites correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Mattermost channel and add some dummy users. Run the workflow to see how it groups users and sends out invites. Adjust the group size or timing to see how it affects the workflow.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer services that enhance remote team engagement, a key challenge in today's work environment. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and open opportunities for further automation projects, boosting your business's value and income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mattermostApi, googleCalendarOAuth2Api.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
