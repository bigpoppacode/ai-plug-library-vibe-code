  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically sends a message to a Mattermost channel whenever a new order is created in WooCommerce. It captures the customer's first name and the product they purchased, then posts a message in the specified Mattermost channel to notify team members of the sale.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up WooCommerce and Mattermost credentials.
3. Customize the Mattermost channel ID to your specific channel.
4. Activate the workflow to start receiving notifications for new orders.

### Practice

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
