## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow syncs new Shopify customer data to Odoo contacts. When a new customer is created in Shopify, the workflow checks if the contact already exists in Odoo using their email. If the contact doesn't exist, it creates a new contact in Odoo with the customer's details, ensuring data consistency across platforms.

### Demonstrate
A business owner using Shopify for sales and Odoo for CRM can use this workflow to automatically keep their customer data updated across both platforms, ensuring seamless customer management and communication without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Shopify and Odoo accounts.
3. Set up the Shopify Trigger for customer creation.
4. Configure the Odoo nodes with your specific custom resource details.
5. Test the workflow by creating a new customer in Shopify.

### Practice
Create a test customer in Shopify and observe how the workflow checks Odoo for existing contacts and creates a new contact if none exists. Modify customer details to see how the workflow handles updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate data synchronization between e-commerce and CRM systems. This skill can attract clients needing seamless integrations, offering them efficiency and accuracy, thus enhancing your service offerings and generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** odooApi, shopifyAccessTokenApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
