# Shopify Zendesk Create Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using zendesk×3, if×2, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On customer updated**.
2. **On customer updated** `shopifyTrigger` — channel/topic: `customers/update`
3. **Search contact by email adress** `zendesk` — resource: **user**, operation: **search**
4. **Keep only UserId and email** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
5. **Add Zendesk contact Id to Shopify data** `merge` — mode: "mergeByKey", propertyName1: "email", propertyName2: "ZendeskEmail"
6. **User exists in Zendesk** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Contact data is modified** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Create contact in Zendesk** `zendesk` — resource: **user**
9. **Update contact in Zendesk** `zendesk` — resource: **user**, operation: **update**
10. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically updates customer information between Shopify and Zendesk. When a customer is updated in Shopify, the workflow checks if the customer exists in Zendesk using their email. If the customer exists, it updates their contact information in Zendesk. If not, it creates a new contact in Zendesk. This ensures that customer data is synchronized across both platforms.

### Demonstrate
A business owner running an e-commerce store on Shopify could use this workflow to keep customer information updated in their Zendesk support system. This ensures that support agents have the latest customer details, enhancing customer service and operational efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Shopify and Zendesk accounts.
3. Set up the Shopify trigger for customer updates.
4. Customize the Zendesk search and update operations to match your data structure.
5. Test the workflow by updating a customer in Shopify and checking the result in Zendesk.

### Practice
Create a test customer in Shopify and update their email or phone number. Run the workflow to see how it updates the corresponding contact in Zendesk. Try modifying different fields and observe the workflow's response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer seamless data synchronization services between e-commerce and support platforms. This can enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, making your automation solutions more attractive to businesses, leading to new clients and increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** shopifyApi, zendeskApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
