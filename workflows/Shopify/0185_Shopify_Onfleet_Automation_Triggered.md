# Shopify Onfleet Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using onfleetTrigger, shopify.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Shopify**.
2. **Shopify** `shopify` — operation: **update**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow listens for specific events from Onfleet, specifically when a task is delayed. Once triggered, it updates the tags of a corresponding Shopify order. This can be useful for e-commerce businesses to track and manage delivery delays efficiently by tagging orders in Shopify for further follow-up or customer communication.

### Demonstrate
A delivery service could use this workflow to automatically tag delayed orders in Shopify, allowing customer service teams to quickly identify which orders need attention and proactively communicate with customers about delays.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Onfleet and Shopify credentials.
3. Configure the Onfleet trigger to listen for task delays.
4. Map Shopify order details to be updated with specific tags.
5. Test the workflow by simulating a task delay in Onfleet.

### Practice
Create a test order in Shopify and simulate a delay in Onfleet. Run the workflow to see how the order tag is updated in Shopify. Experiment with different tags to understand how they can be used for various scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer enhanced e-commerce solutions by integrating delivery tracking with order management systems. This can improve customer service and operational efficiency, potentially leading to new business opportunities and increased revenue in your AI automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
