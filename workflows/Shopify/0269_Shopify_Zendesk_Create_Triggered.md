# Shopify Zendesk Create Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using zendesk×2, shopifyTrigger, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On order updated**.
2. **On order updated** `shopifyTrigger` — channel/topic: `orders/updated`
3. **Find if order already has a ticket in Zendesk** `zendesk` — operation: **getAll**
4. **Keep only ticket Id** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", keepOnlySet: "true"
5. **Add ticket info to order data** `merge` — mode: "mergeByKey", propertyName1: "order_number", propertyName2: "external_Id"
6. **Order exists in Zendesk** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **NoOp** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
8. **Create new ticket for new orders** `zendesk` — description: "=Order #{{ $json["order_number"] }} - {{$json["line_items"].length}} item(s)

Order:
Customer: {{$json["customer"]["first_name"]}} {{$json["customer"]["last_name"]}} 
email: {{$jso…[truncated]", additionalFields: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing customer support tickets for Shopify orders in Zendesk. When an order is updated in Shopify, the workflow checks if a corresponding ticket already exists in Zendesk. If a ticket exists, no further action is taken. If no ticket exists, it creates a new ticket in Zendesk, ensuring that every order has a corresponding support ticket for efficient tracking and resolution.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure every updated Shopify order has a support ticket in Zendesk, streamlining customer service by tracking issues from order updates automatically.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Shopify and Zendesk accounts.
3. Ensure the Shopify trigger is correctly set up for order updates.
4. Customize the Zendesk ticket creation fields as needed.
5. Test the workflow with a sample order update to check ticket creation.

### Practice
Create a test order in Shopify and update it. Run the workflow to see if it correctly checks for existing tickets and creates a new ticket in Zendesk if needed. Modify order details to test different scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated customer support integration services to e-commerce businesses, improving their efficiency and customer satisfaction. This can lead to increased business opportunities and income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** shopifyApi, zendeskApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
