# Shopify Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using shopifyTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Shopify Trigger**.
2. **Shopify Trigger** `shopifyTrigger` — channel/topic: `orders/create`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automatically trigger whenever a new order is created in a Shopify store. It uses a Shopify Trigger node to listen for the `orders/create` event. Once a new order is detected, the workflow can be extended to perform various tasks, such as sending order details to a CRM, notifying the sales team, or updating inventory records.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline order processing. For example, when a customer places an order, the workflow could automatically update the inventory system and notify the warehouse team, ensuring timely fulfillment and efficient operations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Shopify account using the appropriate credentials.
3. Set up the Shopify Trigger node with the channel `orders/create`.
4. Extend the workflow by adding nodes to perform desired actions, such as sending emails or updating databases.
5. Test the workflow by placing a test order in Shopify.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that triggers on a new Shopify order and sends a confirmation email. Use dummy email addresses and order data to safely test the workflow without affecting actual operations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate order processing, reducing manual tasks and improving efficiency. This can lead to faster fulfillment, happier customers, and more time to focus on growing your business. Offering such automations can also position you as a valuable partner for other businesses, opening up new revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** shopifyApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
