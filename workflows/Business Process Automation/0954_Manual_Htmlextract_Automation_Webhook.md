## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data extraction from a website. When manually triggered, it sends an HTTP request to a specified URL, extracts HTML content, and retrieves specific elements (like titles and URLs) for further use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to gather article titles and links from a blog (e.g., Hacker Noon) for content curation or to monitor competitors' articles, saving time on manual data collection.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use the **HTTP Request** node to set the URL you want to scrape.
4. Add **HTML Extract** nodes to specify which elements (e.g., titles, links) to extract using CSS selectors.
5. Test and run the workflow to see results.

### Practice
Experiment by changing the URL in the HTTP Request node to scrape a different website. Adjust the CSS selectors in the HTML Extract nodes to capture different content types, like images or summaries.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection tasks, providing value to clients who need insights from online content, ultimately helping you secure projects or clients in the automation and scraping space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTML Extract1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
