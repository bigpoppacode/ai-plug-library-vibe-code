# Stickynote Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving set, stickyNote, chatTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: Settings (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Chat Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: LLM Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates interactions with an AI language model via OpenRouter. It triggers when a chat message is received, processes it with AI, and manages session memory to ensure context is maintained throughout the conversation.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to enhance customer support by automatically responding to inquiries. For example, when a customer messages on a platform, the AI can provide instant answers based on predefined prompts and session context.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook trigger for incoming messages.
3. Configure the AI agent to process messages and return responses.
4. Implement memory management to keep track of ongoing conversations.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample messages.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the AI agent's prompt to see how different inputs affect the responses. Create variations of the workflow for different use cases, like FAQs or product inquiries.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate customer interactions, saving time and improving response rates. This can help you attract clients looking for efficient solutions, ultimately generating income through your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Settings" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
