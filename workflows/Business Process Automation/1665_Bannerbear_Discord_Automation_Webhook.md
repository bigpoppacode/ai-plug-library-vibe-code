## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating a social media banner. It starts with a form submission to capture event details, generates an AI image for the banner, uploads it to Cloudinary, and then creates a banner using a template in Bannerbear. Finally, it posts the banner to Discord.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline event promotion. For example, when hosting a webinar, they can automatically generate a promotional banner and share it on social media with minimal effort, ensuring timely marketing and increased visibility.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Form Trigger to capture event details (title, location, date).
3. Use the HTTP Request node to upload a generated image to Cloudinary.
4. Send the image and details to Bannerbear to create a banner.
5. Post the completed banner to your desired social media platform using the Discord node.

### Practice
Try creating a simple version of this workflow by generating a banner for a personal event. Use the form to input your event details, generate an image using OpenAI, and upload it to Cloudinary. Share the banner in a private Discord channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients, helping them save time and enhance their marketing efforts. This skill can lead to increased customer satisfaction, repeat business, and potential income as a service provider in automation and AI solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "n8n Form Trigger" and "Generate AI Banner Image" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
