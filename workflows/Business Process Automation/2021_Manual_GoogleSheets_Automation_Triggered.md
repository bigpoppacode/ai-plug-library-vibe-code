# Manual GoogleSheets Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, googleSheets, airtop.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get companies (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Calculate ICP Scoring (airtop)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Format response (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Update row (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scoring companies based on their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) by retrieving data from Google Sheets, analyzing it using an AI tool, formatting the results, and then updating the original spreadsheet with the scores.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to quickly assess potential clients based on criteria like revenue, employee count, and market fit, helping them prioritize leads and tailor marketing strategies effectively.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** to start the process.
3. Use the **Google Sheets** node to retrieve company data.
4. Integrate the **Airtop** node to analyze the data and calculate ICP scores.
5. Use a **Code** node to format the response.
6. Finally, add another **Google Sheets** node to update scores in the original sheet.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding a new scoring criterion or changing the data source. Execute the workflow to see how your changes affect the scoring process and the final output in the Google Sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable automation solutions to businesses, streamline their lead evaluation process, and potentially create a recurring revenue stream by offering these automation services to clients.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Update row" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
