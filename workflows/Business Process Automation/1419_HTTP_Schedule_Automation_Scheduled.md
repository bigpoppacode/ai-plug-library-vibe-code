# HTTP Schedule Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, nextCloud, scheduleTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Nextcloud (nextCloud)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of transferring scanned PDF files to a Nextcloud storage service. It starts with an HTTP request to fetch files, then uploads them to Nextcloud, and runs on a scheduled basis.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically save scanned documents from a USB scanner to Nextcloud, ensuring all files are securely stored without manual intervention, thus saving time and reducing errors.

**Imitate:**  
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run the workflow periodically (e.g., every hour).
3. Insert an **HTTP Request** node to fetch scanned files.
4. Add a **Nextcloud** node to upload the fetched files.
5. Connect nodes logically to ensure data flows from fetching to uploading.

**Practice:**  
Try modifying the workflow to upload files from a different source (like a local folder) instead of an HTTP request. Test it to ensure files are uploaded correctly to Nextcloud.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate file management tasks, increasing efficiency for clients. This skill can attract businesses needing automation, opening avenues for income through consulting or service offerings in workflow automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "HTTP Request" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
