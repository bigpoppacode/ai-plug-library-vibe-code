## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves satellite position data from Google BigQuery every minute, processes it, and prepares it for further use. It ensures timely data collection and storage for analysis or display.

### Demonstrate
A business owner tracking satellite positions for logistics can use this workflow to automatically log data into their database, ensuring they always have up-to-date information without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google BigQuery node to fetch data.
2. Add a Set node to format the data you want to keep.
3. Use an HTTP Request node to gather data from an API.
4. Schedule the workflow with a Cron node to run at your desired frequency.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that retrieves weather data every hour and logs it into a Google Sheet. Use an HTTP Request node for the weather API and a Google Sheets node to append the data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection processes, saving time and reducing errors. This can attract clients looking for efficient solutions, enhancing your service offerings and income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Google BigQuery" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
