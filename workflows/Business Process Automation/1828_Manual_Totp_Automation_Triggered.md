# Manual Totp Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, totp.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: TOTP (totp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow generates TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) codes. It starts with a manual trigger, allowing users to initiate the process, then uses the TOTP node to generate a unique code for authentication, enhancing security.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to secure client logins. For instance, if they run an online platform, they can implement TOTP for two-factor authentication (2FA), protecting user accounts from unauthorized access.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **TOTP** node and configure it with your TOTP credentials.
4. Connect the Manual Trigger to the TOTP node.
5. Save and execute the workflow to generate a TOTP code.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding a notification (e.g., via email or Slack) that sends the generated TOTP code to a specified address. This will help you understand how to integrate multiple nodes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer secure authentication solutions to clients, increasing their trust in your services. This skill can lead to higher-value contracts and recurring revenue as businesses prioritize security.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "TOTP" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
