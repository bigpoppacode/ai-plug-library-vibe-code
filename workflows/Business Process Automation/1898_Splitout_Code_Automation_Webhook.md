## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving and cleaning Amazon keywords based on user input. It fetches keyword data from Airtable and Amazon's API, formats it, and saves the aggregated results back into Airtable, streamlining keyword management for businesses.

### Demonstrate
A business owner running an Amazon FBA store can use this workflow to automatically gather and save relevant keywords for their products. This saves time, enhances SEO efforts, and ensures they stay competitive without manual keyword research.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook to receive keywords.
3. Connect to your Airtable account to fetch existing keywords.
4. Add an HTTP Request node to call the Amazon API for keyword suggestions.
5. Use the Set and Aggregate nodes to format and combine the results.
6. Save the aggregated keywords back to Airtable.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional data sources, like Google Trends, to enhance keyword suggestions. Test the workflow with different keywords to see how it affects the output and learn about data integration.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable automation services to clients, enhancing their marketing efforts and saving them time. This could lead to new business opportunities and increased income as you offer tailored automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Clean Keywords" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
