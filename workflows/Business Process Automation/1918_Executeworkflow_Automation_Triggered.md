## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow formats US phone numbers by validating country codes, stripping formatting, and ensuring the correct number of digits. It cleans and standardizes phone numbers for consistent data handling.

### Demonstrate
A business owner receives leads with varying phone number formats. Using this workflow, they can automatically clean and standardize the phone numbers before entering them into their CRM, enhancing data quality and communication efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a trigger node (like "When Executed by Another Workflow").
3. Add a "Set" node to strip formatting from the phone number.
4. Use "If" and "Switch" nodes to validate the country code and digit count.
5. Format the phone number using another "Set" node.
6. Save or send the formatted number as needed.

### Practice
Try importing this workflow into n8n with sample phone numbers. Modify the input values to see how the workflow handles different formats and check the outputs for accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable services to businesses by ensuring clean, standardized contact data. This can lead to improved customer interactions, increased efficiency, and potential revenue growth through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When Executed by Another Workflow" and "Clear invalid number" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
