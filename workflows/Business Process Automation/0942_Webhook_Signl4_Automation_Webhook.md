## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Start (Testing)** node.
2. **Step 1: TheHive Create Alert (theHive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: TheHive Read Alerts (theHive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: SIGNL4 Send Alert (signl4)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: TheHive Webhook Request (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Start (Testing) (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: SIGNL4 Resolve Alert (signl4)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating and managing alerts for security incidents using TheHive and SIGNL4. It captures alerts, checks their status, and sends notifications while allowing for manual triggering and resolution of alerts.

### Demonstrate
A business owner in cybersecurity can use this workflow to automate incident response. When a security issue is detected, the system creates an alert, notifies the team via SIGNL4, and tracks the alert's status, improving response times and efficiency.

### Imitate
1. **Set up n8n**: Install or access your n8n instance.
2. **Create a new workflow**: Start with a Manual Trigger node.
3. **Add TheHive nodes**: Configure "Create Alert" and "Read Alerts".
4. **Implement IF logic**: Add conditions to check alert status.
5. **Integrate SIGNL4**: Use "Send Alert" and "Resolve Alert" nodes for notifications.
6. **Test your workflow**: Trigger manually and monitor the alert flow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new alert type or a different notification method (like email). Test how changes affect the alert creation and notification process. 

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automation services for incident management, appealing to cybersecurity firms. This expertise can help you attract clients looking to streamline operations, ultimately boosting your income through high-value automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "TheHive Create Alert" and "SIGNL4 Resolve Alert" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
