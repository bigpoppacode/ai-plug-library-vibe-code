2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Ollama Chat Model (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Auto-fixing Output Parser (outputParserAutofixing)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Basic LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: On Error (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Extract JSON Output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting personal data from chat messages using a self-hosted language model. It listens for incoming chat messages, processes them to extract structured information, and handles errors gracefully.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate data collection from customer inquiries via chat, ensuring that pertinent information like names and contact details is captured and stored without manual entry, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Create an n8n workflow and add a "When chat message received" trigger.
2. Add the "Ollama Chat Model" node to process incoming messages.
3. Use "Auto-fixing Output Parser" to refine responses.
4. Implement "Structured Output Parser" to format extracted data.
5. Set up error handling and final output steps as required.

### Practice
Try adapting this workflow by connecting it to a different chat application or modifying the data structure to extract additional information. Test it with sample messages to see how it captures and parses the data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data gathering for clients, improving efficiency and accuracy. This skill can help you attract more customers by offering valuable automation services, ultimately generating additional income for your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "Sticky Note7" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
