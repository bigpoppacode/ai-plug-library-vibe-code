### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of transferring data from Google Sheets to Mailchimp. When triggered, it retrieves emails from a specified range in a Google Sheet and subscribes those emails to a Mailchimp mailing list.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically add new customer emails collected in a Google Sheet to their Mailchimp subscriber list, ensuring timely marketing communications without manual entry.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with email addresses.
2. Create a new workflow in n8n.
3. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the process.
4. Add a **Google Sheets** node to fetch email data.
5. Connect a **Mailchimp** node to subscribe email addresses.
6. Test the workflow by executing it and checking Mailchimp for new subscribers.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with a few email addresses, set up the workflow as outlined, and execute it. Verify that the emails have been added to your Mailchimp list correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline client onboarding processes, build valuable email lists effortlessly, and offer automation services that save time and reduce manual errors, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction and retention.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
