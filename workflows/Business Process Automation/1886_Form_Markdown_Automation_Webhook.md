## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates an on-page SEO audit. It collects a landing page URL, scrapes the website content, analyzes it using OpenAI for SEO insights, and sends a structured report via email.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to quickly evaluate their website's SEO performance. For example, after launching a new product page, they can run this audit to identify content and technical improvements, enhancing search engine visibility.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a "Landing Page Url" trigger to collect the URL.
3. Use "Scrape Website" to pull content from that URL.
4. Add OpenAI nodes for content and technical audits.
5. Merge the results and format them into Markdown.
6. Use the Gmail node to send the report.

### Practice
Set up the workflow with a test URL of your choice. Run it and review the generated SEO audit report. Adjust the analysis prompts to see how different inputs affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable SEO audit services, attracting clients who need to improve their website performance. This skill can help you generate income by providing automated, insightful reports that enhance their online presence.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Landing Page Url" and "Gmail" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
