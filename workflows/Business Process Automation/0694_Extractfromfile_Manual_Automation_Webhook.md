## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of data from a PDF file stored in Google Drive. It triggers on demand, retrieves the PDF, converts it, and sends it to AI models (Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for processing, allowing users to compare results.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate invoice processing. Instead of manually extracting VAT numbers from PDFs, the workflow retrieves the invoice PDF from Google Drive, sends it to AI models for extraction, and returns the VAT numbers efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the n8n workflow.
2. Connect your Google Drive account and set up the API keys for Gemini and Claude.
3. Set the PDF file ID in the Google Drive node to point to your invoice.
4. Modify the prompt in the "Define Prompt" node to specify what data you want extracted.
5. Test the workflow by clicking "Test Workflow."

### Practice
Create a new PDF file with sample data and upload it to your Google Drive. Modify the workflow to extract different information (like invoice totals) and run the workflow to see if it correctly processes the new PDF.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services, enabling businesses to save time and reduce errors in document processing. This skill can attract more clients, increase your service offerings, and generate higher income as a consultant in AI automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking 'Test workflow'" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
