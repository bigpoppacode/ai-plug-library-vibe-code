## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: If (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Request Hugging Face Paper (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

12. **Step 11: Extract Hugging Face Paper Abstract (html)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting research papers from Hugging Face, analyzing their abstracts using OpenAI, and storing the results in Notion. It runs on a schedule, checks for existing entries, and processes new papers efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A researcher could use this workflow to automatically gather and summarize recent AI research papers weekly, saving time on manual searches and ensuring they stay updated on the latest developments in their field.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** to run the workflow weekly.
2. Use an **HTTP Request** node to fetch new Hugging Face papers.
3. Extract paper URLs with an **HTML Extract** node.
4. Loop over each URL to check if it exists in Notion.
5. If not, fetch details and analyze the abstract with OpenAI.
6. Store the results back in Notion.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch papers from a different source, such as arXiv. Adjust the HTTP Request node and extraction logic accordingly to familiarize yourself with data handling in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate research processes, providing value to clients who need timely insights. This skill can help you attract more customers and generate income by offering automation services tailored to academic and research needs.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Extract Hugging Face Paper Abstract" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
