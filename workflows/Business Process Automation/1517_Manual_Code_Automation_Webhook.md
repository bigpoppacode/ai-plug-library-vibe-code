# Manual Code Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Run domain scan (single) (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Authenticates to your Icypeas account (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates domain scanning using the Icypeas API. When manually triggered, it authenticates with Icypeas, sends a request to scan a specified domain, and processes the results, making it easier to analyze domain data without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly scan domains for security or compliance issues. For example, a digital marketing agency might need to verify clients' domains before launching campaigns, ensuring they are not linked to any harmful sites.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n, create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Include a **Code Node** to authenticate with your Icypeas account (insert your API credentials).
4. Add an **HTTP Request Node** to send a scan request (set the domain in the body).
5. Connect the nodes, execute the workflow, and review the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to scan a different domain. Change the value in the HTTP Request Node to test how the workflow handles various inputs and observe the differences in outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable services like domain scanning to clients, enhancing their security posture and compliance. This can lead to increased trust, customer retention, and potential revenue from automation services in your business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Authenticates to your Icypeas account" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
