# Manual HTTP Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, merge.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request2 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Merge PDF1 (mergePdfs)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Read/Write Files from Disk (readWriteFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Read/Write Files from Disk4 (readWriteFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging two PDF files from HTTP requests into a single PDF document and then saves it to disk. The workflow starts with a manual trigger, fetches the PDFs, merges them, and finally writes the merged PDF to a specified location.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically compile reports from various departments into one PDF for weekly reviews. Instead of manually merging PDFs, this automation saves time, ensures consistency, and reduces errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add two **HTTP Request** nodes to fetch the PDF files.
4. Add a **Merge** node to combine the PDFs.
5. Use the **Merge PDF1** node to finalize the merging.
6. Add two **Read/Write File** nodes to save the merged PDF.
7. Execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to merge three PDF files instead of two. Add an additional HTTP Request node to fetch a third PDF and adjust the merge node accordingly. Test the workflow to ensure it still functions correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate document management tasks, making you more efficient and valuable to clients. You can offer PDF merging services as part of a broader automation package, potentially increasing your income and client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Read/Write Files from Disk4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
