# Manual Hubspot Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, hubspot.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Hubspot (hubspot)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
Sure! Here’s a structured breakdown of the n8n workflow using the EDIP teaching method:

### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves all contacts from HubSpot when manually executed. It starts with a trigger to initiate the process and then connects to HubSpot to fetch data on all contacts stored in the CRM.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly access and analyze all customer contacts from HubSpot, enabling targeted marketing campaigns or outreach efforts without manually exporting data.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **HubSpot** node configured to fetch all contacts.
4. Connect the Manual Trigger to the HubSpot node.
5. Execute the workflow to retrieve contact data.

### Practice
Try modifying the HubSpot node to filter contacts by a specific property (e.g., contacts created in the last month) and run the workflow to see how it changes the output.

### WIIFM (What's In It For Me)
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage customer data, enhancing your ability to provide data-driven insights and personalized marketing strategies, ultimately attracting more clients and increasing revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Hubspot" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
