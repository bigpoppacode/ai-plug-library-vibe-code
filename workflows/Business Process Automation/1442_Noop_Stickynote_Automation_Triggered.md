3. **Step 2: Ollama Chat Model (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Auto-fixing Output Parser (outputParserAutofixing)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Basic LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: On Error (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Extract JSON Output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of personal data from chat messages using a self-hosted LLM (Large Language Model). It receives chat messages, processes them through various nodes, and outputs structured data based on a predefined schema.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically analyze customer inquiries from a chat interface. For example, an e-commerce site could extract customer contact info and feedback from chat interactions, streamlining customer support and data collection.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud).
2. Import the provided workflow JSON.
3. Configure the chat trigger to connect to your chat service.
4. Customize the output schema in the Structured Output Parser to fit your data needs.
5. Test the workflow with sample chat messages.

### Practice
Create a new chat message with sample data and trigger the workflow. Check the output to ensure it correctly extracts and formats the data according to your defined schema. Adjust the parsing rules if necessary.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automation solutions that enhance data collection and analysis for businesses, helping them save time and improve customer interactions. This can lead to increased demand for your automation services and higher income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "Sticky Note7" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
