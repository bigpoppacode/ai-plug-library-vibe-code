# Manual Zulip Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, function, zammad.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Ticket Filtering (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: List Tickets (zammad)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Notify for Standup (zulip)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Standup Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates ticket management by fetching open tickets from Zammad, filtering them by status, and sending a summary report to a customer support team in Zulip for daily stand-up meetings.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline their customer support process, ensuring their team is updated on ticket statuses, which helps improve response times and enhances team collaboration during daily stand-ups.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up**: Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. **Add Trigger**: Use a Manual Trigger or Cron node to schedule the workflow.
3. **Fetch Tickets**: Add a Zammad node to list all tickets.
4. **Filter Tickets**: Include a Function node to categorize ticket statuses (new, open, pending).
5. **Notify Team**: Use a Zulip node to send a summary of filtered tickets to the support stream.

### Practice
Try modifying the ticket filtering logic to categorize tickets based on different criteria (e.g., priority level) and observe how it impacts the summary sent to Zulip.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow equips you to create efficient automation solutions, potentially attracting clients looking to optimize their customer support processes, thus generating income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Standup Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
