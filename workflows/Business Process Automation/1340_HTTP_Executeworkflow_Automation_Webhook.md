# HTTP ExecuteWorkflow Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, httpRequest, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Embed image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get similarity of medoids (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Compare scores (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Variables for medoids (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Info About Crop Labeled Clusters (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Total Points in Collection (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Each Crop Counts (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Image URL hardcode (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note22 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the detection of anomalous crop images by comparing them against a known dataset. It processes an input image URL, generates an embedding using AI, and checks its similarity to existing crop images to identify potential anomalies.

### Demonstrate
A farmer receives a new crop image and wants to ensure it isn’t an anomaly that could affect yield. This workflow allows them to input the image URL, automatically analyze it, and receive instant feedback on whether the crop is known or potentially problematic.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Webhook Trigger** to receive an image URL.
3. Use the **HTTP Request** node to generate an embedding for the image.
4. Query your database (like Qdrant) to compare the embedding with existing crop data.
5. Use a **Code node** to evaluate the similarity scores and determine if it’s anomalous.
6. Set up a notification node (like Email or Slack) to send the results.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with different crop images to see how it identifies anomalies. Document the results, noting which images are recognized and which are flagged as anomalies. Adjust the similarity threshold in the code to see how it affects outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable services to agricultural businesses, enabling them to monitor crop health effectively. This skill can be monetized by offering anomaly detection solutions or consulting services, ultimately generating income through automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note1" and "Sticky Note22" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
