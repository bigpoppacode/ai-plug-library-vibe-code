## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow reads RSS feeds from two sources when manually triggered, processes the data using JavaScript, and loops through the items for further action. It's a way to automate the gathering of content updates from multiple blogs or news sites.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to aggregate updates from industry blogs, sending them to their team via email or Slack. This saves time on manual checks and ensures the team stays updated on relevant news.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Implement a **Code** node to define RSS feed URLs.
4. Use the **RSS Feed Read** node to fetch data from the defined URLs.
5. Add a **Split In Batches** node to process each feed item individually.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow to pull RSS feeds from your favorite news sites. Change the URLs in the Code node and experiment with sending the results to your email or Slack for a daily digest.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content aggregation, saving time and enhancing productivity for you or your clients. This skill can attract customers looking to streamline their information gathering, leading to potential income growth through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "RSS Feed Read" and "Loop Over Items" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
