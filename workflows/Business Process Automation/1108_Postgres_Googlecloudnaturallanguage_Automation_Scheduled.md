## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving tweets with the hashtag #OnThisDay, analyzing their sentiment using Google Cloud Natural Language, and storing relevant data in Postgres and MongoDB. If the sentiment score is above a certain threshold, it sends notifications via Slack.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically track and analyze public sentiment around their brand on specific historical dates, allowing them to engage with their audience or adjust marketing strategies based on real-time feedback.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Twitter API account and create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Cron Trigger** to run daily at a specified time.
3. Connect a **Twitter Node** to search for tweets with #OnThisDay.
4. Use a **Google Cloud Natural Language Node** to analyze sentiment.
5. Add **Postgres and MongoDB Nodes** to store tweet data.
6. Include an **IF Node** to filter tweets based on sentiment scores.
7. Connect a **Slack Node** to send notifications for positive tweets.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the hashtag or sentiment threshold. See how it impacts the number of tweets collected and notifications sent. Test different hashtags relevant to your business or interests.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable insights for businesses, enabling them to engage with their audience based on real-time sentiment analysis. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and potentially higher revenue, making you a sought-after automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Twitter" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
