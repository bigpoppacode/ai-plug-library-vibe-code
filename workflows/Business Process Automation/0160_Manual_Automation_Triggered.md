# Manual Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of assigning values to variables. When executed, it triggers a "Set" node that defines specific variables: a number (20), a string ("From n8n with love"), and a boolean (true).

### Demonstrate
A small business owner could use this workflow to set predefined values for customer data input. For example, when a new customer signs up, the workflow can automatically assign a welcome message and a default status, streamlining data processing.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node to start the workflow.
3. Add a "Set" node to define variables like number, string, and boolean.
4. Assign values to these variables (e.g., number: 10, string: "Hello", boolean: false).
5. Execute the workflow to see the assigned values.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional variables or change the values in the "Set" node. Execute it multiple times to observe how it handles different inputs and outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to automate repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency and saving time. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, enhancing your service offerings and potential income in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Set" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
