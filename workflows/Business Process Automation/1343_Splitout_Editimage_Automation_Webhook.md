## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of removing backgrounds from images stored in Google Drive. It triggers when a new image is uploaded, processes the image to remove its background, and saves the edited image back to Google Drive.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to automatically remove backgrounds from product images uploaded to Google Drive, saving time and ensuring consistent image quality for online catalogs.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Drive folder to store images.
2. Configure the n8n workflow to trigger on new image uploads.
3. Add nodes to remove backgrounds, adjust sizes, and save edited images back to Google Drive.
4. Test with sample images to ensure everything works as intended.

### Practice
Try uploading a few test images to the specified Google Drive folder and see if the workflow automatically processes them. Check if the edited images are saved correctly with backgrounds removed.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable automation services, helping clients save time and improve efficiency in image processing, which can lead to more business opportunities and income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Config" and "loop all over your images" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
