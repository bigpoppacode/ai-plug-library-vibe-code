Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Local File Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Local File Trigger (localFileTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Files and Folders (executeCommand)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Files and Folders to Array (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Mistral Cloud Chat Model (lmChatMistralCloud)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set Variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Move Files into Folders (executeCommand)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: If Has Target Files... (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Get Suggestions to List (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: AI File Manager (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the organization of files in a specified local folder. It triggers when new files are added, identifies them, uses AI to categorize them into folders, and moves them accordingly, streamlining file management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically sort incoming project files into designated folders, reducing clutter and saving time. For example, a graphic designer could keep design files organized by client automatically.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Local File Trigger** to monitor your target folder.
2. Use **Execute Command** to list files and folders in that directory.
3. Parse this data into arrays with a **Set** node.
4. Implement the **Mistral AI** node to categorize files.
5. Use another **Execute Command** to move files based on AI suggestions.

### Practice
Experiment by creating a test folder. Place various files in it, run the workflow, and observe how it sorts them. Adjust the AI prompts to see how categorization changes based on the input you provide.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable automation services to clients, saving them time and enhancing productivity. This skill could lead to increased demand for your services, allowing you to charge more for your expertise in AI-driven file management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Local File Trigger" and "AI File Manager" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
