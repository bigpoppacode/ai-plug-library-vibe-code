## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting PDF files into text and then generating new PDFs from HTML content. It includes steps for extracting text, coding, and manual trigger testing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate document management. For example, a law firm could streamline client document reviews by converting legal PDFs into editable text and creating summaries in PDF format for clients.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Convert PDF into Text** node and configure it.
4. Add an **HTML to PDF** node with your HTML input.
5. Create another **Convert PDF into Text** node for the output.
6. Include a **Code** node for any custom logic needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the HTML input in the **HTML to PDF** node and run the workflow. Check if the generated PDF reflects your changes. This will help you understand how data flows through the nodes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate document processing tasks, saving time and enhancing productivity for clients. This skill can be a valuable offering in an AI automation business, attracting more customers and increasing income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Convert PDF into Text" and "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
