14. **Step 13: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Prepare column data (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Filter (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Check operation (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates interactions with a Google Sheet using AI. It triggers when a query is entered, retrieves data from the sheet, processes it with OpenAI, and generates a response based on the user’s question.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly answer customer inquiries about their order status by querying a Google Sheet that tracks orders, providing instant responses without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with relevant data (e.g., customer orders).
2. Create a new n8n workflow and add an **Execute Workflow Trigger**.
3. Add a **Google Sheets node** to fetch data based on user input.
4. Implement an **OpenAI node** to process the retrieved data and formulate a response.
5. Set up a **Chat Trigger** to initiate the workflow when a user asks a question.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to query a different Google Sheet (like customer feedback) and adjust the AI response logic to summarize the feedback instead of answering questions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to automate data retrieval and customer interactions, enhancing efficiency. This skill can help you offer valuable services to businesses, potentially increasing your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Execute Workflow Trigger" and "AI Agent" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
