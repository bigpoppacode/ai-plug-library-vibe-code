### Explain
This n8n workflow automates sending scheduled messages to a Discord channel every week and every 30 minutes. It uses cron triggers to schedule the messages, which include humorous images and text, making it ideal for engagement.

### Demonstrate

### Imitate
1. Set up a cron trigger for your desired schedule (e.g., every Friday at 9 AM).
2. Add a Discord node to send a message to your channel.
3. Customize the message content and webhook URL.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for additional messages as needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure messages are sent as scheduled.

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that sends a motivational quote to a Discord channel every Monday at 9 AM. Use a free quote API to fetch random quotes for variety. Test it to see if it works as planned.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
