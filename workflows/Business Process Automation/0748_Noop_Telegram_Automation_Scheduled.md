### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reading an RSS feed and sending updates to a Telegram chat. It checks for new entries, compares them with previously read ones, and only sends notifications for new content, ensuring the user stays updated without manual checking.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically send daily updates about industry news or product releases to their Telegram channel, saving time on manual checks and keeping their team informed in real-time.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron node** to schedule how often to check the RSS feed.
3. Add an **RSS Feed Read node** to specify the feed URL.
4. Use a **Function node** to keep track of the latest read date.
5. Add an **IF node** to check if there are new entries.
6. Connect a **Telegram node** to send messages if there are new updates.

### Practice
Try modifying the RSS feed URL in the workflow to track a different source. Test the workflow by adding new entries to the feed and verifying that notifications are sent to your Telegram chat only for those updates.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to create automated communication channels, enhancing client engagement and efficiency. It can help you offer valuable automation services, attract more clients, and increase your income by providing real-time updates and insights.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Telegram" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
