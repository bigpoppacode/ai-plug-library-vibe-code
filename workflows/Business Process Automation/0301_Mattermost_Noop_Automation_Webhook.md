### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of responding to messages that use non-gender-inclusive language. It triggers with a webhook, checks the message content, and if it detects terms like "guys" or "dudes," it sends a friendly reminder to use gender-inclusive language via Mattermost.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow in a team communication platform to promote inclusivity. For instance, when a team member types "Hey guys," the workflow automatically sends a message suggesting alternatives like "folks" or "everyone," fostering a more inclusive workplace culture.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a Webhook node to start the workflow.
3. Include an IF node to check for specific terms in the message.
4. Add a Mattermost node to send a reminder message if those terms are detected.
5. Test the workflow by sending a sample message through the webhook.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional terms or different responses. For example, add more gender-inclusive suggestions or change the message tone. Test it by sending various messages to see how the workflow reacts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to enhance workplace communication and promote inclusivity, making you a valuable asset to businesses. By offering such automation services, you can attract clients focused on diversity and inclusion, ultimately generating income through your expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "NoOp" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
