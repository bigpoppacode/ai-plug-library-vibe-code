# HTTP Twitter Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, cron, twitter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Request blablagues** node.
2. **Step 1: Request blablagues (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Recup image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: At 17H image jokes (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Tweet image jokes (twitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching image jokes from an API every day at 5 PM and tweeting them. It consists of four main steps: requesting jokes, retrieving images, scheduling the task, and sending tweets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to engage their audience on social media by sharing daily humor, increasing follower interaction and brand visibility without manual effort. 

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch jokes from the Blablagues API.
3. Add another **HTTP Request** node to retrieve the image.
4. Use a **Cron** node to schedule the workflow to run daily at 5 PM.
5. Add a **Twitter** node to post the joke and image.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the posting time or to fetch a different type of content (like quotes) from another API. Test the new setup and observe the results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate social media engagement, saving time while enhancing brand presence. This skill can attract clients seeking to boost their online visibility, creating potential income streams through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Request blablagues" and "Tweet image jokes" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
