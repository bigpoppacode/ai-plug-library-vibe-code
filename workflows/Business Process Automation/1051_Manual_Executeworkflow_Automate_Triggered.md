### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the execution of another workflow when a manual trigger is activated. It allows a user to initiate a series of automated tasks simply by clicking a button, streamlining processes without needing to set up complex triggers.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to trigger a report generation process. For example, when they click "execute," the workflow could pull data from various sources, compile it, and send a summary report to their email, saving time and effort.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **Execute Workflow** node and set the workflow ID to the one you want to trigger.
4. Connect the Manual Trigger to the Execute Workflow node.
5. Save and execute the workflow to test it.

### Practice
Try creating a similar workflow that sends a notification email when triggered. Add a Manual Trigger, then an Email node, and set it up to send an email to yourself or a colleague.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
