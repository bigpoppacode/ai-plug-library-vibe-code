# Splitout Code Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, webhook, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Sticky Note** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Code (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Split Out1 (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Get Changes1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Skip File Change1 (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Parse Last Diff Line1 (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reviewing code changes in a project. It captures changes from a GitLab merge request, analyzes the differences, and uses AI to generate a review comment, which is then posted back to the merge request.

### Demonstrate
For a software development team, this workflow saves time by automating code reviews. Instead of manually checking each line of code, the team can rely on AI to quickly assess changes and provide feedback, speeding up the development process.

### Imitate
1. Set up a GitLab webhook to trigger the workflow on new merge requests.
2. Use a code node to parse the incoming git diff.
3. Integrate OpenAI to evaluate the code changes and generate a review comment.
4. Post the review back to GitLab using an HTTP request node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional code quality checks. For example, add steps to check for coding standards or run automated tests before generating the review comment.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to software development teams, improving their efficiency. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction, potential upsell opportunities, and a way to generate higher income in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
