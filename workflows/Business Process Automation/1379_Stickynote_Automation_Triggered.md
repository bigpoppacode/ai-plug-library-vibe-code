# Stickynote Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving chatTrigger, lmChatOllama, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Ollama Chat Model (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Chat LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow allows users to chat with local AI models (LLMs) via a simple interface. When a chat message is received, it sends the input to a local LLM (Ollama) for processing, and then returns the AI-generated response back to the chat interface.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support. Instead of manually answering FAQs, customers can type their questions into a chat interface, and the AI provides instant responses, enhancing customer experience and saving time.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and install Ollama on your machine.
2. Create a new workflow with a "When chat message received" trigger.
3. Add the "Ollama Chat Model" node to process the chat input.
4. Connect a "Chat LLM Chain" to send the input to Ollama and receive a response.
5. Test the workflow by sending a chat message and verifying the AI's response.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to customize responses. Change the chat message input or adjust the parameters in the "Ollama Chat Model" node to see how the AI's output varies with different prompts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you create automated customer support systems, leading to increased efficiency and client satisfaction. This capability can attract more customers and generate income by offering automation services to businesses looking to enhance their operations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "Chat LLM Chain" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
