## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow reads a sitemap from a specified URL, converts the XML data into a JSON format, filters the URLs to extract only those ending with ".pdf", and displays the results. It's a simple automation for gathering specific web content.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor a competitor's website for new PDF resources. Automating this process saves time and keeps them updated on relevant content without manual checks.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Update the "Set sitemap URL" node with your target sitemap URL.
3. Run the workflow using the "Test workflow" trigger.
4. Check the output for filtered PDF URLs.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that filters for URLs ending in ".jpg" instead of ".pdf". Adjust the "Filter URLs" node accordingly and test it to see if it captures image links.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow equips you to automate content monitoring for clients, adding value to your services. It can help you generate leads and establish a reputation as a knowledgeable automation consultant, leading to potential income opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "‘Test workflow’ trigger" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
