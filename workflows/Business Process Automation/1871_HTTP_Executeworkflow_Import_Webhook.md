## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves Bible verses based on user-specified references and translations. It processes a JSON input, sends a request to an API to fetch the scriptures, and formats the response for easy use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner running a Bible study group could use this workflow to automatically fetch scriptures for weekly discussions, saving time on searching and ensuring accuracy across multiple translations.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n workflow.
2. Create a JSON input node with your desired Bible references and translation.
3. Add an HTTP Request node to query the GetBible API.
4. Use a Set node to format the API response.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves the correct verses.

### Practice
Try modifying the JSON input to include different Bible translations or references. Run the workflow to see how it adapts and retrieves various scriptures, enhancing your understanding of dynamic API queries.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide valuable automation services, helping clients streamline scripture retrieval for events or applications, potentially generating income through tailored solutions for churches or religious organizations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Map API Respons to Result" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
