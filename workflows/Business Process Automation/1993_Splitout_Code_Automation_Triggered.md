# Splitout Code Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving splitOut, googleTranslate, aggregate.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Receive SRT File to Translate** node.
2. **Step 1: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Google Translate (googleTranslate)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Aggregate (aggregate)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Edit Fields (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Convert to File (convertToFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Split SRT Lines (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Generate Binary (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Prep Parts for Translate (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Clean Translations & Group Titles (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Join completed text with double new line (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Respond with file (form)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Receive SRT File to Translate (formTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Extract text from Binary File (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Expose Binary (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the translation of SRT subtitle files. It takes an uploaded SRT file, splits the text for translation, uses Google Translate to convert it to a specified language, cleans the translations, and then returns the translated file.

### Demonstrate
A film production company can use this workflow to quickly translate subtitles for international releases. Instead of manually translating each subtitle, they can automate the process to save time and ensure consistency across multiple languages.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Webhook Trigger** to receive SRT files.
2. Add a **Google Translate** node for translation.
3. Use **Code nodes** to split, clean, and aggregate subtitles.
4. Convert the final output to a file format.
5. Respond with the translated file to the user.

### Practice
Try uploading an SRT file with simple subtitles to the workflow. Observe the translation process and check the output file for accuracy. Experiment with different languages to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you hours of manual translation, offering a valuable service to clients needing quick localization. This skill can attract customers in the media industry and generate income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Split Out" and "Expose Binary" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
