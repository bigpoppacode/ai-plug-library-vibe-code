## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching unassigned tickets from Zendesk, formatting the information into a Slack message, and sending that message to a designated Slack channel. It can be triggered manually or scheduled to run automatically.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to ensure their support team is promptly informed about unassigned tickets. This helps in managing customer queries efficiently, reducing response time, and improving customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install n8n and create a new workflow.
2. **Add Manual Trigger**: Start with a Manual Trigger node to test.
3. **Add Cron Node**: Schedule the workflow to run daily at a specific time.
4. **Connect Zendesk Node**: Fetch unassigned tickets with a query.
5. **Add Function Node**: Format ticket information for Slack.
6. **Add Slack Node**: Send the formatted message to a Slack channel.
7. **Test and Activate**: Execute the workflow to test and then activate it.

### Practice
Create a similar workflow that fetches new leads from a CRM (like Airtable) instead of Zendesk and sends a summary to your email. This will help you understand the connections and data formatting required.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate ticket management, enhancing customer service efficiency, which can attract more clients to your automation services. This skill can lead to increased revenue by offering valuable automation solutions to businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Zendesk" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
