## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the classification of user queries into four types (Factual, Analytical, Opinion, Contextual) and employs different strategies to generate tailored responses based on the classification, enhancing the quality of answers provided.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automate customer support inquiries, ensuring each query is categorized and answered accurately, increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction without adding more staff.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook trigger to receive user queries.
2. Add a classification node to categorize the query.
3. Use a switch node to route the query to the appropriate strategy (Factual, Analytical, Opinion, Contextual).
4. Implement respective retrieval and response nodes for each strategy.
5. Finally, send the tailored response back to the user.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow by classifying three different types of queries (e.g., "What is your return policy?", "What do customers think about this product?", "How do I track my order?") and generating basic responses for each.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide automated customer support solutions, reducing operational costs while improving response accuracy and speed, making it a valuable service for businesses looking to enhance their customer engagement.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Query Classification" and "Sticky Note8" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
