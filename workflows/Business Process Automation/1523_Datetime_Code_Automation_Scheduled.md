## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates notifications for Daylight Saving Time changes. It checks a list of time zones, determines if any will change tomorrow, and sends alerts through Slack and email reminders to adjust schedules.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure their team is aware of time changes, preventing missed meetings. For example, a company with remote employees across different time zones can send timely reminders to adjust meeting times.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the time zones in the "Timezones List" node.
3. Set up your Slack and email notifications with your credentials.
4. Test the workflow by triggering it manually or scheduling it to run before Daylight Saving Time.

### Practice
Create a simple modification: instead of notifying about Daylight Saving Time, set it to notify about holidays or company events. Adjust the "Timezones List" with relevant dates and test the notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate time-sensitive notifications, enhancing your service offerings as a consultant or business owner. It saves time, reduces errors, and improves communication, which can attract more clients and increase revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Send Email On Upcoming Change" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
