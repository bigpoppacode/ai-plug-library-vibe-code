## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Ollama Dynamic LLM (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: LLM Router (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: AI Agent with Dynamic LLM (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Ollama phi4 (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Router Chat Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Agent Chat Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note9 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of routing chat messages through various AI language models. It analyzes user prompts and dynamically selects the best model to respond, ensuring efficient and contextually relevant interactions while maintaining user privacy.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support via chat. Instead of manually responding to inquiries, the workflow quickly analyzes questions and routes them to the most suitable AI model, improving response times and customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Chat Trigger** node to capture incoming messages.
3. Insert a **Router** node to analyze the message and choose the correct AI model.
4. Connect the selected AI model node (like **Ollama**) to generate responses.
5. Add a **Memory** node to retain context across interactions.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new AI model or change the routing logic. Test it with different prompts to see how the responses vary based on the selected model, ensuring each user interaction is handled effectively.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer high-value automation services, attracting customers who need AI-driven solutions. By enhancing customer interactions, you can increase client satisfaction and revenue, positioning yourself as a go-to automation expert.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
