## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving user information from Facebook's Graph API when triggered. It starts with a manual trigger and then fetches the user's first and last names using the Facebook API.

### Demonstrate
A marketing consultant could use this workflow to quickly gather user names from Facebook for a targeted advertising campaign, saving time and ensuring accurate data collection for outreach efforts.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account.
2. Create a new workflow and add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Add a "Facebook Graph API" node connected to the manual trigger.
4. Configure the API node to fetch user data (first and last names).
5. Execute the workflow to see the retrieved names.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch additional fields from the Facebook Graph API, such as email or profile picture URL, and see how the data structure changes in the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection from social media platforms, enhancing your ability to target customers effectively and saving significant time, which can translate into increased revenue for your automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Facebook Graph API" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
