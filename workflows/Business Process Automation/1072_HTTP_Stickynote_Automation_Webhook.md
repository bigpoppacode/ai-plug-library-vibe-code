# HTTP Stickynote Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving executeWorkflowTrigger, set, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When Executed by Another Workflow** node.
2. **Step 1: When Executed by Another Workflow (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set Prompt Variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Extract API Response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Workflow Overview (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Perplexity Research Content1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the collection of research content based on user queries. When triggered, it formats the query, sends it to the Perplexity AI, and retrieves the response for further use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate research for blog posts or product descriptions. Instead of manually searching for information, they can input queries and receive curated content automatically, saving time and improving quality.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a trigger (e.g., a webhook or manual trigger).
3. Configure the "Set Prompt Variables" node to define your research query.
4. Connect the "Perplexity Research Content1" to send the query and receive a response.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it retrieves the desired content.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only pulls information from a public API (like a weather API) based on user input. Use manual triggers to input queries, and log the responses to a Google Sheet for practice.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable automation services, streamline research processes for clients, and enhance your offerings as an AI automation consultant, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When Executed by Another Workflow" and "Perplexity Research Content1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
