# Manual Schedule Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8n, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: n8n1 (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: n8n list execution (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: If (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: delete execution (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: No Operation, do nothing (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the management of executions by checking for older executions and deleting them if they're older than 10 days, while also allowing for manual testing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep their automation system tidy by automatically deleting old execution records, freeing up space and ensuring better performance of workflows.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to test.
3. Add an n8n node to list executions.
4. Use an If node to check if the execution is older than 10 days.
5. Connect a delete execution node to remove old records, and a No Operation node for those that don't meet the condition.

### Practice
Try running the workflow manually. Modify the "If" condition to check for a different time frame (e.g., 5 days). Observe how it affects which executions are deleted.

### WIIFM
Learning this workflow allows you to automate data management tasks, saving time and reducing errors, which can be a valuable service for clients looking to streamline their operations and focus on growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "No Operation, do nothing" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
