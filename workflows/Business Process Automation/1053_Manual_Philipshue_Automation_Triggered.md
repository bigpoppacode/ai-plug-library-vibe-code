### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of turning on a Philips Hue light and adjusting its brightness when you manually trigger it. It consists of a manual trigger node and a Philips Hue action node that communicates with your smart light.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate lighting in their store. For instance, they can set the lights to turn on and adjust brightness during opening hours, enhancing customer experience while saving energy.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger Node**.
3. Add a **Philips Hue Node**, configuring it with your light ID and desired brightness (e.g., 90).
4. Connect the manual trigger to the Philips Hue node.
5. Save and execute the workflow to test.

### Practice
Try modifying the brightness level in the Philips Hue node and observe how it changes when you execute the workflow. Experiment with different light IDs if you have multiple Philips Hue lights.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automation services, allowing businesses to enhance their environment with smart lighting solutions, ultimately saving time and improving customer satisfaction, leading to potential income growth.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
