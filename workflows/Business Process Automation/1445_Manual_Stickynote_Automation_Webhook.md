## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow extracts Amazon's best-selling electronic data using a series of automated steps, starting from a manual trigger to gather data from Amazon via HTTP requests, process it with AI, and notify users with structured outputs.

A business owner could use this workflow to automatically monitor and analyze Amazon's best-selling electronics, allowing them to adjust inventory or marketing strategies based on real-time data, thus staying competitive.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Use the Set node to define the Amazon URL.
4. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch data from Amazon.
5. Integrate a Structured Data Extractor to process the data.
6. Set up a Webhook to notify stakeholders with the extracted information.

### Practice
Try modifying the Amazon URL in the workflow to explore different categories, then run the workflow to see how it collects and processes new data, helping reinforce your understanding of data extraction.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
