# Manual N8n Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8n, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: n8n (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Find params with affected expressions (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process triggered by a manual click. It identifies parameters in workflows that are affected by recent changes, helping users ensure their workflows function correctly after updates.

### Demonstrate
A consultant might use this workflow after upgrading n8n to ensure all active workflows still use the correct expressions, preventing issues that could arise from changes in functionality.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Connect to the "n8n" node to filter active workflows.
4. Use a "Code" node to find affected parameters.
5. Add a "Sticky Note" to display results and notes.

### Practice
Try running the workflow after making a small change in n8n (like adding a new node). Observe how the workflow identifies any parameters that may need adjustment based on the recent change.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you maintain reliable automations despite platform updates, increasing your value as a consultant by ensuring client workflows are always functional and efficient.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
