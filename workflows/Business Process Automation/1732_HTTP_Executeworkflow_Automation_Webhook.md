# HTTP ExecuteWorkflow Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, httpRequest, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Embed image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get similarity of medoids (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Compare scores (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Variables for medoids (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Info About Crop Labeled Clusters (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Total Points in Collection (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Each Crop Counts (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Image URL hardcode (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note22 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow detects anomalies in a dataset of crops by analyzing images. It takes an image URL, uses AI to generate embeddings, and compares these with known crop images in a database to determine if the input image is an anomaly or belongs to an existing category.

### Demonstrate
A farmer receives an image of a plant suspected to be a new crop type. Using this workflow, they can input the image URL, and the system will analyze it to see if it matches known crops or flag it as an anomaly, helping them identify new species quickly.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a trigger node to receive an image URL.
3. Use the HTTP Request node to send the image to an embedding API.
4. Query a vector database for similar crop images.
5. Implement a code node to compare scores and determine if it's an anomaly.
6. Output the results.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with different images of crops, including known ones and random plants. Observe how the system identifies anomalies and refine the thresholds for classification based on your observations.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable services in agricultural tech, enabling farmers to quickly identify new crop types, thus saving time and increasing efficiency. This can lead to potential business opportunities in automation and AI for agriculture.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note1" and "Sticky Note22" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
