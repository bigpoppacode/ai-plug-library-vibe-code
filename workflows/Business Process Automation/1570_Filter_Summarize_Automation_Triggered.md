# Filter Summarize Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving textSplitterTokenSplitter, notionTrigger, notion.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Notion - Page Added Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Token Splitter (textSplitterTokenSplitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Notion - Page Added Trigger (notionTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Notion - Retrieve Page Content (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Filter Non-Text Content (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Summarize - Concatenate Notion's blocks content (summarize)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Create metadata and load content (documentDefaultDataLoader)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Embeddings Google Gemini (embeddingsGoogleGemini)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Pinecone Vector Store (vectorStorePinecone)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting Notion page content into a format suitable for machine learning. It retrieves text from Notion, filters out non-text elements, summarizes the content, and stores it in a vector database for AI applications.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the extraction of notes from team meetings in Notion. By summarizing and storing them in a vector database, they can quickly retrieve relevant insights for future projects or reference, saving time and enhancing productivity.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Notion account and create a database for your notes.
2. Import the n8n workflow and connect your Notion account.
3. Configure the token splitter and summarization nodes to fit your text length requirements.
4. Set the workflow to trigger on new Notion page additions.
5. Test by adding a new page in Notion and check the vector store for updates.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding a new node that sends an email summary of the extracted content to yourself. This will help you understand how data flows through the nodes and how to customize outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable asset in AI automation services. By offering streamlined content extraction and summarization, you can help clients save time and improve decision-making, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction and increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Token Splitter" and "Pinecone Vector Store" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
