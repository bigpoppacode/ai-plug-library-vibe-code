# Splitout Github Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, stickyNote, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Globals (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get all files in given path (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Split the result (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Get file content from GitHub (github)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Convert files to JSON (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Restore n8n Credentials (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Check for skipped Credentials (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow restores credentials from GitHub backups. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves files from a specified GitHub repository, processes them into JSON format, and restores the credentials in n8n, ensuring your automation environment is secure and up-to-date.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to quickly restore lost or corrupted API credentials for their applications from GitHub backups, ensuring minimal downtime and maintaining operational efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Set up a **Set** node to define `repo.owner`, `repo.name`, and `repo.path`.
4. Use an **HTTP Request** node to get files from GitHub.
5. Process files with a **Function** node to convert to JSON.
6. Use the **n8n** node to restore credentials.
7. Test the workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that retrieves a single file from a GitHub repo and logs its content to the console. This will help solidify your understanding of HTTP requests and data handling in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate credential management, saving time and reducing errors. As an automation consultant, you can offer this as a service, enhancing your value proposition to clients and increasing your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Check for skipped Credentials" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
