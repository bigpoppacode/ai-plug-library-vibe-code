### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating tags in Shopify based on Onfleet events, specifically when a task is delayed. It uses a webhook to trigger actions and connects two services, making it easier to manage customer orders and logistics.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically update product tags in Shopify whenever a delivery is delayed. This helps them manage inventory and customer expectations without manual effort, improving operational efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Set up an Onfleet account and create a webhook trigger in n8n.
2. Add a Shopify node to update tags based on the Onfleet event.
3. Configure the workflow to specify which tags to update when a task is marked as delayed.
4. Test the workflow by simulating a delayed task in Onfleet.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by adding a third step that sends a notification (e.g., via email or Slack) whenever a task is delayed. This will help you understand how to integrate multiple actions in a single workflow.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline operations, save time, and enhance customer satisfaction. It positions you to offer valuable automation services to potential clients, helping them improve their logistics and inventory management.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
