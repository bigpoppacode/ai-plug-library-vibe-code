# Stickynote Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving chatTrigger, chainLlm, lmOllama.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Basic LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Ollama Model (lmOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Structured Response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Error Response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: JSON to Object (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates chat message processing. It triggers when a message is received, uses a language model to generate responses, and formats the output in JSON. It handles both successful and error responses, ensuring robust interaction.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support via chat. When a customer sends a query, the workflow processes the message, generates a response using AI, and sends it back, saving time and improving customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Chat Trigger" node to capture incoming messages.
3. Insert a "Basic LLM Chain" node to process the message.
4. Connect to the "Ollama Model" node for AI responses.
5. Use "Set" nodes to structure both successful and error responses.
6. Test the workflow by sending a chat message.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the "Basic LLM Chain" node to see how different questions affect the AI's responses. Experiment with various inputs and observe the output structure to understand the workflow's flexibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated chat solutions, attracting clients looking to enhance customer service. This expertise can lead to new income streams as part of an AI automation business, optimizing operations for various industries.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "JSON to Object" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
