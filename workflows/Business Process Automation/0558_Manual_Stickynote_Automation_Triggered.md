# Manual Stickynote Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, code, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: TOTP VALIDATION (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF CODE IS VALID (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: EXAMPLE FIELDS (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow validates Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) by manually triggering the process, checking the input code against a secret, and then determining if the code is valid. If valid, it can proceed to further actions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to implement two-factor authentication for their web application, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive areas, thereby enhancing security and trust with customers.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Code** node for TOTP validation (adapt the provided Python code).
4. Use an **If** node to check if the code is valid.
5. Set up actions for valid/invalid responses (e.g., send a notification).

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the TOTP secret and the code in the **EXAMPLE FIELDS** node. Click "Test Workflow" to see how the validation process responds to different inputs and understand the flow of data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps students provide secure authentication solutions, a valuable service in today's digital landscape. It positions them as trusted automation experts, opening doors to new clients and income opportunities.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "EXAMPLE FIELDS" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
