## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the review and risk assessment of GitLab merge requests (MRs). It fetches code changes, generates a distribution list for notifications, checks if there are changes, utilizes AI to analyze the code, and sends structured reports via email and comments on the MR.

### Demonstrate
A software development team uses this workflow to streamline code reviews. When a developer submits a merge request, the workflow assesses the code changes, generates a risk report, and notifies relevant team members, ensuring quicker feedback and higher code quality.

### Imitate
1. **Create a new workflow** in n8n.
2. **Add a GitLab trigger** to start on merge request events.
3. **Insert an HTTP request** node to fetch the code diff from GitLab.
4. **Use a code node** for generating a distribution list based on project leads.
5. **Set up a conditional node** to check for changes.
6. **Integrate an AI agent** to analyze the changes and generate a report.
7. **Add email and GitLab comment nodes** to send the report to the team.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of the workflow. Set up a GitLab trigger and an HTTP request to fetch a merge request's details. Output the data in a console log to understand the data structure before proceeding to the next steps.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to automate code reviews, ensuring faster feedback and better quality control. As a consultant, you can offer this as a service, helping teams save time and reduce errors, which can lead to increased client satisfaction and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Extract Diff" and "GitLab Trigger2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
