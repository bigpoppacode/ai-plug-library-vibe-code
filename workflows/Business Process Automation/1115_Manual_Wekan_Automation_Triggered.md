## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a project board in Wekan. When executed, it creates a board titled "Documentation," adds two lists ("To Do" and "Done"), and then creates a card in the "To Do" list, which is later moved to the "Done" list.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to streamline project setup. Instead of manually creating a board and lists for each project, they could execute this workflow to quickly establish a new project board in Wekan, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Wekan** node to create a board with the title "Documentation."
4. Connect a second **Wekan** node to create a "To Do" list on that board.
5. Add another **Wekan** node for a "Done" list.
6. Create a card in the "To Do" list with details.
7. Connect a final **Wekan** node to move that card to the "Done" list.
8. Save and execute the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to create additional lists or cards based on your specific project needs. For instance, add a "In Progress" list and create a card that transitions through all three lists.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate project management tasks, saving time and reducing manual errors. This skill can attract clients who need efficient project setup solutions, enhancing your value as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Wekan4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
