# HTTP GitLab Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving gitlabTrigger, httpRequest, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Gitlab Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Gitlab Trigger (gitlabTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: IF (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow triggers when a new tag is pushed in a GitLab repository. If the tag indicates a release, it sends a request to create a new document in Outline, including details like the release name and description.

### Demonstrate
A software developer might use this workflow to automate documentation updates. When a new software version is released, this workflow creates a corresponding document in Outline, ensuring that project documentation stays current without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Set up a GitLab Trigger for your repository.
2. Add an HTTP Request node to create a document in your desired application (like Notion or Google Docs).
3. Use an IF node to check if the tag is a release.
4. Connect the nodes and customize the document details.
5. Run and test the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to send an email notification instead of creating a document when a new release is tagged. This will help you understand how to change outputs based on triggers.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors in documentation. This skill can help you attract clients as an automation consultant, increasing your service offerings and income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Gitlab Trigger" and "IF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
