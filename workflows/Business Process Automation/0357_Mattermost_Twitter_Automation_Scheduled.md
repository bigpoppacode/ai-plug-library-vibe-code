### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Create an account and open n8n.
2. **Add Nodes**: Start with a Cron node to trigger every minute, then add a Twitter node to search for "n8n_io."

4. **Send Notification**: Connect a Mattermost node to send the tweet details to your desired channel.
5. **Test**: Run the workflow to ensure it captures and sends notifications correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the search term in the Twitter node to monitor a different keyword or hashtag. Observe how the workflow adapts and if it correctly fetches and sends notifications for that term.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
