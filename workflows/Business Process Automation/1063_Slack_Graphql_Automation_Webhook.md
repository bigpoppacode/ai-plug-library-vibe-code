# Slack Graphql Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving webhook, graphql, function.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is triggered by an incoming webhook. It acts as a live API endpoint.
2. **Step 1: Webhook (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: GraphQL (graphql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Function (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

### Explain
This n8n workflow captures a GitHub username via a webhook, retrieves the user's information (like name, company, and email) through a GraphQL API call, processes this data to extract emails, and sends the information to a specified Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate user onboarding. When a new developer joins, they can input their GitHub username, and the workflow automatically fetches their details and notifies the team in Slack, saving time on manual lookups.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Webhook** node to capture GitHub usernames.
3. Add a **GraphQL** node to query GitHub's API for user details.
4. Use a **Function** node to filter and extract relevant emails.
5. Add a **Slack** node to send the user information to a designated channel.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional GitHub data, such as repositories or activity stats, and send that information in the Slack notification. This will help reinforce your understanding of data manipulation and integration.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can significantly improve your automation skills, allowing you to provide valuable services to clients, such as streamlined onboarding processes, which can lead to higher client retention and increased revenue for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "Slack" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
