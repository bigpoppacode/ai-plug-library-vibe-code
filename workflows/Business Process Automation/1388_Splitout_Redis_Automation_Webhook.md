## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a user interview process using an AI agent. It captures user responses to dynamically generated questions, saves transcripts, and handles session management for a seamless experience.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to conduct customer feedback interviews, automatically gathering insights without manual effort. The AI generates questions based on previous answers, enhancing engagement and efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Webhook Trigger** to start the interview.
2. Use **Set Nodes** to define initial questions.
3. Add an **AI Researcher Node** to generate follow-up questions based on responses.
4. Implement **Redis** for session management and data storage.
5. Create a **Google Sheets Node** to log responses for analysis.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow. Set up a basic form trigger that asks one question, captures the response, and saves it to a Google Sheet. Gradually add complexity by implementing follow-up questions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated interview services, saving businesses time and enhancing data collection processes. This skill can help you attract clients, create value, and generate income in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Stop Interview?" and "Get Session" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
