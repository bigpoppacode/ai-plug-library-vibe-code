## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting blog content from a specified URL, parsing it, and then publishing the content to Medium. It helps streamline content sharing from a website to a social platform automatically.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with a blog can use this workflow to automatically share new posts on Medium. By automating this process, they save time and ensure consistent content distribution without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Set up an HTTP Request node to your blog URL.
2. Use HTML nodes to extract blog titles and links.
3. Create an Item Lists node to organize the extracted data.
4. Add a Medium node to publish the content.
5. Test by executing the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the blog URL in the HTTP Request node to see how it affects the extracted content. Ensure you can successfully publish to Medium by running the workflow multiple times with different posts.

### WIIFM

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
