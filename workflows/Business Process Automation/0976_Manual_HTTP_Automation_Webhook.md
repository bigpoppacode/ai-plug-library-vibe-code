## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates posting articles to Wallabag by triggering actions based on user input or scheduled times, fetching data from RSS feeds, and interacting with APIs to streamline content management.

### Demonstrate
A content manager can use this workflow to automatically save articles from RSS feeds to Wallabag, ensuring they never miss relevant content while saving time and enhancing productivity.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger or cron schedule in n8n.
2. Use HTTP Request nodes to authenticate with Wallabag and fetch articles from an RSS feed.
3. Implement a function node to process and filter articles.
4. Use conditional logic to determine if articles should be saved.
5. Configure output to Wallabag via another HTTP Request node.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that fetches a single article from an RSS feed and saves it to Wallabag. Experiment with different filtering conditions to see how it affects the saved content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content curation, saving time and effort. It positions you as an automation expert, appealing to clients seeking efficiency, and opens opportunities to offer similar automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Auth TTRss" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
