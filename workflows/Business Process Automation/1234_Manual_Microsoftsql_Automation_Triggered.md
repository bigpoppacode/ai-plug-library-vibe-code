# Manual MicrosoftSQL Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, microsoftSql.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Microsoft SQL (microsoftSql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates executing an SQL query in Microsoft SQL. It starts with a manual trigger and then connects to Microsoft SQL to run a specified query, making data retrieval or manipulation efficient.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to fetch customer data from a database and generate reports automatically. For instance, retrieving sales data weekly to analyze trends without manual input saves time and reduces errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Microsoft SQL** node.
4. Configure the SQL node with your database credentials and desired query.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to see the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the SQL query in the Microsoft SQL node to extract different data, such as customer names or sales figures, and observe the changes in the output. Experiment with different queries to understand how data retrieval works.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate data retrieval tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency. This skill can attract clients looking for automation solutions, helping you generate income as a consultant in AI automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Microsoft SQL" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
