## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving Zoom meeting data, extracting transcripts, formatting them, and emailing a summary to participants, along with creating follow-up tasks and meetings.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to streamline post-meeting tasks, saving time by automatically sending meeting summaries and action items to clients, ensuring no important details are missed.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Zoom account and email credentials.
3. Adjust the nodes to fit your meeting structure and desired summary format.
4. Test the workflow by running a meeting and checking the outputs.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that only retrieves and emails the last Zoom meeting transcript. Experiment with formatting the email content differently to see how it affects clarity.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation skills, allowing you to offer valuable services to clients, save time on repetitive tasks, and potentially increase your income by providing efficient solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
