## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Email trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Email trigger (emailReadImap)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Classify email (textClassifier)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Extract variables - email & attachment (informationExtractor)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Extract data from attachment (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: OpenAI Chat Model 2 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Workflow 2 (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Workflow 3 (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: workflow 4 (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates email processing by reading incoming emails, classifying them into categories (like job applications or invoices), extracting relevant data, and using OpenAI to generate responses or further process the information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline job application management. Instead of manually reading and categorizing emails, the system automatically sorts applications, extracts candidate details, and generates standardized responses, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up an email trigger node to monitor your inbox.
2. Add a classification node to categorize emails (e.g., job application, lead).
3. Use an extractor node to pull out relevant data from emails and attachments.
4. Integrate an OpenAI node to generate responses based on the extracted data.
5. Connect to an output node (like sending a response email) to complete the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to handle a different type of email, such as customer feedback. Adjust the classification categories and extraction criteria to match the new use case, then test it with sample emails.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services, helping clients save time and improve efficiency. This expertise can lead to high-ticket project opportunities, recurring revenue, and a competitive edge in the growing automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Email trigger" and "workflow 4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
