## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates lead generation by scraping leads from a specified source and storing them in an Airtable database. It begins with a manual trigger, scrapes data, processes it, filters out leads without email addresses, and saves the relevant information.

### Demonstrate
A consultant can use this workflow to automate lead collection for a marketing campaign. Instead of manually gathering contacts from various sources, the workflow scrapes leads, enriches their data, and stores it, saving time and ensuring a comprehensive database for outreach.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the manual trigger to start the process.
3. Set up the HTTP request node to scrape leads from your desired source.
4. Customize the Airtable node to match your database structure.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data flows correctly from scraping to storage.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that only scrapes and saves a small number of leads (e.g., 5). Modify the scraping URL and the Airtable structure to see how changes affect the output. Run it multiple times to understand the flow and results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate lead generation, providing significant time savings for businesses. As a consultant, you can offer this as a service, increasing your value and potentially generating recurring income through automated lead management solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Filter leads without email" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
