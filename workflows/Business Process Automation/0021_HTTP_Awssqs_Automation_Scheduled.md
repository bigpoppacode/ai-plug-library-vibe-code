# HTTP AWSSQS Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving awsSqs, set, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **AWS SQS** node.
2. **Step 1: AWS SQS (awsSqs)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering satellite position data from an API every minute. It uses AWS SQS to send this data for further processing, sets relevant parameters, and schedules the task to run regularly.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to track the position of satellites for a space-related project, ensuring they receive timely updates without manual checks, thus saving time and increasing efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron** node to trigger every minute.
3. Connect an **HTTP Request** node to fetch data from the satellite API.
4. Use a **Set** node to format the data you want to send.
5. Connect an **AWS SQS** node to send the formatted data to your queue.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch data from a different API (like weather data) instead of the satellite API. Observe how the output changes and ensure the data is correctly formatted for sending.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate data collection tasks, making your services more efficient. This skill is valuable for attracting clients in industries like aerospace, logistics, or environmental monitoring, potentially leading to income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "AWS SQS" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
