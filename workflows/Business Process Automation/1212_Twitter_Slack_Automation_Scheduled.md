## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically scrapes Twitter for mentions of a specific company every 10 minutes. If new mentions are found, it filters the data and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel with the tweet text and a link to it.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor social media mentions of their brand. For example, a restaurant might want to alert the team whenever someone tweets about their food, allowing for timely engagement and customer service.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a "Run Every 10 Minutes" cron node.
3. Use the "Get last 50 mentions" Twitter node to search for your brand's handle.
4. Add an "If" node to check if the mentions are new.
5. Use a "Set" node to format the tweet data.
6. Finally, post to a Slack channel with the tweet information.

### Practice
Try modifying the search term in the Twitter node to monitor a different brand or topic. Test the workflow by tweeting about it and ensuring the notification appears in Slack.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer social media monitoring services, helping businesses engage with their audience in real-time. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and potential income through consulting or agency services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Filter Tweet Data" and "Post to Slack" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
