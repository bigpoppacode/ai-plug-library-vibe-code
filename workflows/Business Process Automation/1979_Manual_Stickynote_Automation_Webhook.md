## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow extracts and summarizes data from Wikipedia using AI. It triggers on demand, retrieves information using the Bright Data API, processes it with Google Gemini AI for summarization, and sends the results via a webhook or stores them for later use.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to quickly generate summaries of Wikipedia articles for market research, saving time and ensuring they have concise information to share with their team or clients.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Use the Bright Data API to fetch a Wikipedia article.
3. Process the article with Google Gemini for summarization.
4. Send the summary to a webhook or store it in a database.
5. Test and adjust parameters as needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to summarize a different Wikipedia page. Change the URL in the "Set Wikipedia URL with Bright Data Zone" node and execute the workflow to see how it adapts to new content.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content generation, providing value to clients by offering insights quickly. This can position you as a go-to consultant for companies looking to streamline their research processes and leverage AI for efficiency.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
