3. **Step 2: Get PDF or Images (googleDriveTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Route based on PDF or Image (switch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Download PDF (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Download Image (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Extract data from PDF (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Send data to A.I. (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Convert to CSV (convertToFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Upload to Google Drive (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Convert to CSV2 (convertToFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Upload to Google Drive1 (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

15. **Step 14: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Vertex A.I. extract text (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of text from PDFs and images using AI, converting the information into CSV files for easy analysis and storage. It triggers when new files are added to Google Drive, processes them, and stores the results back in Google Drive.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate the processing of scanned invoices or receipts. Instead of manually entering data into spreadsheets, the workflow extracts the required information and compiles it into organized CSV files, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Drive folder for PDFs/images.
2. Create a new n8n workflow and add a Google Drive Trigger for file creation.
3. Use a Switch node to route based on file type (PDF/Image).
4. Add nodes to download the file, extract data, send it to an AI model for processing, and convert to CSV.
5. Upload the CSV file back to Google Drive.

### Practice
Try creating a simple version of the workflow that only processes one type of file (e.g., PDFs). Test it with a sample PDF to see if the data extraction and CSV conversion work correctly. Adjust nodes as needed to improve accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data entry tasks, freeing up time for strategic activities. As a consultant or business owner, you can offer this service to clients, helping them save costs and improve efficiency, ultimately generating more revenue and retaining customers.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Google Gemini Chat Model" and "Vertex A.I. extract text" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
