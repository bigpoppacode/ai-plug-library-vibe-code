## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction and processing of legislative documents related to sustainability from a website. It retrieves records, filters them based on sustainability criteria using AI, and stores the relevant information in Google Sheets and Google Tasks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze EU legislative documents daily. This saves time in compliance tracking and enables timely responses to sustainability-related regulations, enhancing their brand's eco-friendly image.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up necessary API credentials for Google Sheets and Google Tasks.
3. Adjust the HTTP request URL to point to the relevant legislative site.
4. Modify the AI prompt to suit your specific sustainability criteria.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it extracts and logs the correct data.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow to extract data from a different website or document type. Change the extraction logic and see how it affects the output stored in Google Sheets. This will help reinforce your understanding of web scraping and data processing.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide valuable automation services to clients, helping them save time and improve compliance. This skill can lead to increased demand for your services, higher client retention, and the potential for recurring income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Loop Over Items" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
