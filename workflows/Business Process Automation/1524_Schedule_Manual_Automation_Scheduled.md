# Schedule Manual Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, n8n, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: n8n (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Log into n8n (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: retry workflow automatically (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: If (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: No Operation, do nothing (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: login_details (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrying failed executions in the n8n platform hourly. It checks for errors, logs in, retrieves execution details, and retries the failed tasks, ensuring smoother operations without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A business owner managing automated workflows may use this to ensure that failed tasks—like sending emails or processing data—are retried automatically, reducing downtime and ensuring that important processes continue without manual oversight.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Schedule Trigger" to run hourly.
3. Use the "n8n" node to fetch failed executions.
4. Log into n8n using the "httpRequest" node.
5. Implement retry logic using "httpRequest" to retry executions.
6. Set conditions with the "If" node to process only those that need retries.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that simulates an error (e.g., a failed HTTP request). Implement the retry logic as outlined, and observe how the workflow behaves when it retries the failed task. Adjust parameters to see how changes affect retries.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients, ensuring their operations run smoothly without manual intervention, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction and potentially increased income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
