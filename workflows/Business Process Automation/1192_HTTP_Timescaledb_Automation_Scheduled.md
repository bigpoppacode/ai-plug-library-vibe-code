# HTTP TimescaleDB Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving timescaleDb, set, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **TimescaleDB** node.
2. **Step 1: TimescaleDB (timescaleDb)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the tracking of the International Space Station's (ISS) position by querying a TimescaleDB, retrieving the latest coordinates via HTTP, and setting them for further processing. It runs every minute using a cron job.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to monitor satellite positions for a space-related project. For instance, a company offering satellite communication services could track the ISS's location to optimize their service delivery and improve customer experience.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n workflow and add a Cron node to trigger every minute.
2. Use an HTTP Request node to call the ISS position API.
3. Add a Set node to format the received data (latitude, longitude, timestamp).
4. Connect a TimescaleDB node to log the data into your database.
5. Test the workflow and adjust parameters as needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to log the ISS's position every 5 minutes instead of every minute. Test it by checking the TimescaleDB to ensure the data is recorded correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate real-time data collection, a valuable skill for businesses needing timely insights. This can lead to new client opportunities in sectors like aerospace, telecommunications, or research, enabling you to offer high-value automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "TimescaleDB" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
