### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of selecting conference speakers. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves data from Airtable based on certain criteria, generates a promotional image using Bannerbear, and creates a Trello card for the selected speakers.

### Demonstrate
A business owner organizing a conference could use this workflow to streamline speaker selection. Instead of manually checking scores and creating promotional materials, they could automate the entire process, saving time and ensuring consistency in branding.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger to start the process.
3. Connect your Airtable account and specify the table for speaker data.
4. Set up the Bannerbear node to create promotional images using data from Airtable.
5. Connect Trello to create task cards for selected speakers.

### Practice
Try modifying the Airtable filter to include different score thresholds. Test the workflow to see how it affects the selection of speakers and the generated images. Observe how changing these parameters impacts the Trello card creation.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
