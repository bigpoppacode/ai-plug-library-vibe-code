# HTTP Cron Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, function, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Checks IP if new (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: subdomains (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Loops trough Subdomain list (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Send data to Namecheap (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get Public IP address (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: yourdomain.com (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates dynamic DNS updates for subdomains. It checks for a new public IP address every 15 minutes and updates the corresponding records in Namecheap if there's a change. This ensures that your domain points to the correct IP address without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A web hosting company might use this workflow to automatically update DNS records for clients who have dynamic IP addresses. This prevents downtime and ensures that clients' websites remain accessible even when their IP changes.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Cron node to trigger every 15 minutes.
2. Use an HTTP Request node to get the current public IP address.
3. Implement a Function node to check if the IP has changed.
4. Create another Function node to loop through your subdomains.
5. Send an HTTP Request to Namecheap to update DNS records if needed.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it updates correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying this workflow to work with a different DNS provider, or add a notification step (like sending an email) to alert you whenever an IP change occurs. This will help you understand how to adapt workflows to new scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable automation services to clients with dynamic DNS needs, making you a go-to resource for web hosting solutions. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and recurring income opportunities as you offer management services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "yourdomain.com" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
