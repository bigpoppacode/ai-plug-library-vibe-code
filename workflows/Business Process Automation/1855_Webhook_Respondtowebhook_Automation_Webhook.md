## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating unique QR code coupons for lead generation. When a user submits a form, it checks for duplicates, assigns a coupon, and sends an email with the QR code for validation.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer engagement. For instance, a restaurant could collect customer info via a form, generate unique discount coupons, and send them via email, enhancing customer loyalty and tracking.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook to capture form submissions.
2. Use an "If" node to check for duplicates in Google Sheets.
3. Generate a coupon code and store it.
4. Send an email with the QR code to the customer.
5. Update the Google Sheet with lead info and coupon status.

### Practice
Try creating a simple form with your name and email. Set up the workflow to capture submissions and send a confirmation email. Experiment with adding more fields and checking for duplicates in a sample Google Sheet.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate customer interactions, save time, and reduce errors. As a consultant, you can offer this as a service to businesses, enhancing their marketing efforts and potentially increasing your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Webhook" and "Sticky Note7" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
