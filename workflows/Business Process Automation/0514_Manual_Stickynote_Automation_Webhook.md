## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting a PPTX file into a PDF. It starts with a manual trigger, downloads a PPTX file, converts it to PDF, and saves the result to disk.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline creating PDF reports from presentation slides. Instead of manual conversion, they can automatically generate PDFs for clients or internal use, saving time and reducing errors.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to download a PPTX file.
4. Add another **HTTP Request** node to convert the PPTX to PDF.
5. Add a **Read/Write File** node to save the PDF to disk.
6. Connect the nodes in sequence and test the workflow.

### Practice
Create a simple test workflow where you replace the PPTX file URL with a different file format (like DOCX) you want to convert. Experiment with saving different formats to see how the process changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you hours of manual work, making you more efficient. As a consultant, you can offer document conversion as a service, attracting clients who need streamlined processes, thereby generating additional income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "File conversion to PDF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
