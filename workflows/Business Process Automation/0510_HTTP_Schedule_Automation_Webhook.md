## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates web scraping using a schedule trigger. It collects data from a specified website via the Scrappey API, allowing users to gather information regularly without manual effort.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically scrape competitor websites for pricing or product information. This helps them stay competitive by analyzing market trends without dedicating hours to manual research.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to set how often to run the workflow.
3. Insert a **Set Node** to define the data (e.g., website URL).
4. Use the **HTTP Request Node** to connect to the Scrappey API with your API key.
5. Map the output to store or use the scraped data.

### Practice
Modify the workflow to scrape a different website or change the data you collect (e.g., product names instead of prices). Test it to see how the changes affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you save time and provide valuable insights for clients, making you more attractive as a consultant. It positions you to offer high-demand services like market analysis, which can generate significant income.

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
