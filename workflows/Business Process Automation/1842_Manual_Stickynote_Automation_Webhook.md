## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging two PDF files. It starts with a manual trigger, downloads two PDFs, merges them using an API, and saves the resulting file to disk. It's a handy way to streamline document management tasks.

### Demonstrate
A business owner needs to combine multiple product brochures into one PDF for a presentation. This workflow automates that process, saving time and ensuring consistency, allowing them to focus on other aspects of their business.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "Manual Trigger" node.
3. Use "HTTP Request" nodes to download two PDF files.
4. Integrate a "Merge PDF" API call.
5. Add a "Write File" node to save the merged PDF.
6. Test the workflow to ensure it works correctly.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow that merges two text files instead of PDFs. Use the same steps, but adjust the HTTP requests to point to text files, ensuring the merging and saving processes work similarly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to clients, making their document management more efficient. This skill can lead to increased business opportunities, higher customer satisfaction, and potential income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "PDF merge API HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
