## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates video generation based on text prompts. It triggers when a manual test is initiated, generates a video with random camera motion, and stores the video information in Airtable.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create promotional videos for social media. By automating video generation, they save time and resources, enabling them to focus on strategy rather than manual content creation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the **manual trigger** to start the process.
3. Configure the **Text 2 Video** node with your API credentials.
4. Adjust the **Global SETTINGS** node for your video prompt and settings.
5. Test the workflow and check the output in Airtable.

### Practice
Try modifying the **video prompt** in the Global SETTINGS node. Change it to something relevant to your business, run the workflow, and observe the generated video and Airtable entry.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to create unique video content effortlessly, enhance your digital marketing strategies, and offer valuable services to clients, leading to increased revenue and customer engagement.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
