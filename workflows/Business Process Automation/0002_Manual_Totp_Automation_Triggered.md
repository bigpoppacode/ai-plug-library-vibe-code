# Manual Totp Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, totp.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: TOTP (totp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow generates Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) when manually triggered. It allows users to create secure temporary codes for authentication, enhancing security for applications and services.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to secure access to sensitive data. For example, if they manage a financial app, they can implement TOTP for user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access their accounts.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Connect a **TOTP** node.
4. Configure the TOTP node with your settings.
5. Execute the workflow and observe the generated TOTP code.

### Practice
Try modifying the TOTP generation settings (like time interval) and re-run the workflow. Note how the generated code changes with each execution, reinforcing your understanding of TOTP functionality.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer security solutions to clients, making your automation services more valuable. By providing secure authentication methods, you can attract more customers and potentially increase your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "TOTP" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
