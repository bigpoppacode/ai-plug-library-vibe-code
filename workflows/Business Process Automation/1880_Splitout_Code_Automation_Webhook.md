## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping job postings from Hacker News' "Who is Hiring?" thread, extracting relevant job data, and storing it in Airtable for easy access and analysis.

### Demonstrate
A startup owner can use this workflow to automatically gather job postings from Hacker News, saving time on manual searches and enabling them to focus on hiring the right candidates more efficiently.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your manual trigger to start the process.
3. Configure the HTTP request to connect to the Hacker News API.
4. Use output parsing to structure the job data.
5. Connect the final step to write results into Airtable.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to filter job postings by location or type (e.g., remote vs. on-site) and see how it impacts the data stored in Airtable.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection for job postings, creating value for clients who need hiring insights, thus enabling you to charge for your automation services effectively.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "HN API: Get Main Post" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
