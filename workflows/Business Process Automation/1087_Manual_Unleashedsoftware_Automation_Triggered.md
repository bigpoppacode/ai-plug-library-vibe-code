3. **Step 2: Unleashed Software (unleashedSoftware)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering completed orders from Unleashed Software when manually triggered. It fetches all orders marked as "Completed," streamlining data retrieval for business insights.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly access order data for reporting or inventory management, saving time on manual checks and ensuring they have up-to-date information for decision-making.

### Imitate
1. Set up a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert the **Unleashed Software** node and configure it to filter for "Completed" orders.
4. Connect the nodes and save the workflow.
5. Execute the workflow to retrieve order data.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to filter orders based on a different status (e.g., "Pending") and observe how the output changes. This will help you better understand data filtering in n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data retrieval, which can save time and reduce errors, making you more appealing to potential customers as an automation consultant, ultimately leading to increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Unleashed Software" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
