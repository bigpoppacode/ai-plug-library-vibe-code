13. **Step 12: Split all citations from a single message (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Retrieve file name from a file ID (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Regularize output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Optional Markdown to HTML (markdown)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving files and generating citations using OpenAI. It integrates various steps to collect data, process it, and format the output, ensuring that users can efficiently reference files and content.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the retrieval of documents from a database and generate citations with OpenAI, saving time on manual searches and ensuring accurate references in reports or presentations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the OpenAI API key.
3. Customize the file retrieval settings in the HTTP Request nodes.
4. Adjust the formatting logic in the code node to fit your citation style.
5. Test the workflow with sample data.

### Practice
Experiment by modifying the workflow to retrieve different types of files or change the citation format. Try integrating it with another service, like Google Docs, to automatically insert citations into a document.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable automation services, helping clients save time and improve accuracy in their documentation processes, which can lead to increased business opportunities and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Aggregate" and "Finnaly format the output" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
