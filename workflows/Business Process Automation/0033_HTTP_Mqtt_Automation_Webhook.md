# HTTP MQTT Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving cron, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Cron** node.
2. **Step 1: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Set (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: MQTT (mqtt)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically retrieves the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) every minute and sends that data via MQTT. It consists of a cron trigger, an HTTP request to fetch the ISS position, a set node to format the data, and an MQTT node to publish it.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor the ISS's position for a space-themed educational app, providing real-time updates to users. This could enhance user engagement and attract more subscribers to the app.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Cron** node to trigger every minute.
3. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch data from `https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544/positions`.
4. Use a **Set** node to format the retrieved data (name, latitude, longitude, timestamp).
5. Add an **MQTT** node to publish the formatted data to a topic like "iss-position".

### Practice
Try modifying the cron frequency to every 5 minutes and observe how the output changes. Additionally, explore the data structure returned by the HTTP request and adjust the Set node to include more fields if available.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate real-time data retrieval and distribution, creating value for businesses needing live updates, enhancing user engagement, and opening new revenue streams through innovative applications.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "MQTT" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
