# Splitout Code Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving googleDriveTrigger, googleDrive, extractFromFile.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Google Drive Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Google Drive Trigger (googleDriveTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Google Drive (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Extract from File (extractFromFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Merge (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Upload to Drive (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Get filename (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Get result (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Remove PII columns (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors a Google Drive folder for new CSV files, extracts data, identifies and removes any personally identifiable information (PII) using OpenAI, and then uploads the sanitized file back to Drive. It's a streamlined process for ensuring data privacy.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate data privacy compliance. For example, a marketing agency receives customer data in CSV format; this workflow sanitizes the data by removing PII before storing it, ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Drive Trigger to monitor a specific folder.
2. Use the Google Drive node to download new files.
3. Extract relevant data from these files.
4. Send the data to OpenAI to identify PII.
5. Use a code node to remove the identified PII columns.
6. Merge the results and upload the sanitized file back to Google Drive.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that triggers on a new file in a Google Drive folder, then log the filename and the number of rows extracted. This will help you understand the initial steps of monitoring and data handling.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you offer valuable data sanitation services to clients, ensuring their compliance with privacy laws. This can lead to more business opportunities, as companies increasingly seek to protect customer data and avoid hefty fines.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Google Drive Trigger" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
