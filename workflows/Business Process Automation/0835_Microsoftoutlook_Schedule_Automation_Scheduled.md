### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the MySQL connection with your database credentials.
3. Set the Schedule Trigger to your preferred time.
4. Customize the Switch conditions for your specific cost centers.
5. Adjust email recipients in the Microsoft Outlook nodes.

### Practice
Try modifying the SQL query in the MySQL node to filter projects by a specific status or date. Execute the workflow and check if the email notifications reflect your changes accurately.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
