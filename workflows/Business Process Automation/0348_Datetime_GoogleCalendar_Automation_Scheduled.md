Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating Zoom meetings based on Google Calendar events. It checks for specific criteria (like avoiding overlaps or in-person meetings) and triggers the creation of a Zoom meeting when conditions are met.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline scheduling by automatically creating Zoom meetings for their online appointments, reducing manual input and avoiding scheduling conflicts.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up a Manual Trigger in n8n.
2. Use the Google Calendar node to fetch upcoming events.
3. Add an IF node to filter out unwanted events (like in-person).
4. Use the Zoom node to create meetings for the filtered events.
5. Connect a Cron node to automate the process daily.

**Practice:**  
Try modifying the workflow to include a notification step (like sending a Slack message) when a Zoom meeting is created, allowing you to test and understand the flow better.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can save time on scheduling, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer service, making you more attractive to potential clients as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Cron Once a Day" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
