10. **Step 9: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Set Application Details1 (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: /login (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: /receive-token (webhook)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates user login via Auth0, handling access tokens and user information retrieval. It ensures users can log in securely and efficiently, providing a streamlined login experience for applications.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to simplify user authentication for their web application, ensuring secure access for users while automating the backend processes that verify login credentials and manage user sessions.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance.
2. Create a new workflow and add a **Webhook Trigger** for `/login`.
3. Add a **Set Node** to define application details (domain, client_id).
4. Connect to the **Request Access Token Node** to handle token requests.
5. Use **Get Userinfo Node** to retrieve user data.
6. Add error handling with an **If Node** to manage login failures.
7. Test the workflow by simulating a login request.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional user data fields, such as user roles or permissions, and see how this affects the login process. Test various scenarios to ensure robust error handling.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps students create secure authentication systems, enhancing their service offerings. This skill can attract clients looking for reliable login solutions, leading to new business opportunities and income generation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Request Access Token" and "Sticky Note7" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
