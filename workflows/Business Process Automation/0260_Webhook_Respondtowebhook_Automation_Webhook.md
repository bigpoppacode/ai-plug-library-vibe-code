## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting podcast episode data from a webpage. It triggers manually, fetches episode links, cleans duplicates, retrieves episode scripts, and formats them into an RSS feed, which can be served via a webhook.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automate podcast episode updates on their website. Instead of manually checking for new episodes, the workflow fetches, processes, and publishes the latest episodes automatically, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. **Create a Manual Trigger Node** to start the workflow.
2. **Add an HTTP Request Node** to fetch the podcast overview page.
3. **Use HTML Extract Node** to gather episode links.
4. **Add Item Lists Node** to remove duplicates and split links.
5. **Fetch each episode page** with another HTTP Request Node.
6. **Extract the script** using HTML Extract.
7. **Parse the JSON** and define feed items using a Function Node.
8. **Set up a Webhook Node** to serve the RSS feed.
9. **Add a Respond to Webhook Node** to return the feed.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to fetch episodes from a different podcast website. Change the URL in the HTTP Request Node and adjust the CSS selectors in the HTML Extract Node to match the new site's structure.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content updates for clients, providing a valuable service that saves time and enhances their digital presence. This skill can help you attract more clients and generate income through automation services, particularly in the growing podcast industry.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Serve feed" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
