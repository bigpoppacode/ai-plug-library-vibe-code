### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting data from a WordPress site and converting it into a CSV file. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves data from WordPress, formats it into a spreadsheet, and saves it as a binary file.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to regularly export blog post data from their WordPress site to analyze content performance or share updates with their team, saving time compared to manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node as the starting point.
3. Add a **WordPress** node to fetch data, configuring it to get all posts.
4. Add a **Spreadsheet File** node to format the retrieved data into CSV.
5. Add a **Write Binary File** node to save the CSV with a specified filename.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to filter the WordPress data by a specific category or date range before exporting it to CSV. Experiment with different parameters to see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline data management tasks, enhancing your productivity and making you more attractive to potential clients who need efficient data handling solutions, ultimately driving business growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Write Binary File" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
