## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of pushing multiple files to a GitHub repository. It retrieves the latest commit, creates a new tree with the specified files, commits the changes, and updates the branch, all through GitHub's REST API.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically update their project repository with new marketing materials or reports weekly, ensuring that their team always has access to the latest documents without manual uploads.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger and configure it.
3. Set your GitHub credentials in the "Set Github Info" node.
4. Modify the "Create new tree" node with your desired filenames and content.
5. Connect the nodes as shown in the workflow and test it.

### Practice
Try modifying the content of "File 1" and "File 2" in the workflow, then run the automation to see how it updates the files in your GitHub repository. Check the repo to confirm the changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to clients, helping them streamline their version control processes and save time, ultimately enhancing your income potential as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get latest commit SHA" and "File 2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
