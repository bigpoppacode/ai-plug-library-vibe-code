## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction and summarization of Google Trends data. It starts by triggering a manual test, sets up necessary URLs, retrieves data using web requests, processes it with AI models, and finally sends a summary via email.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather and summarize trending topics in their industry, helping them stay informed and adjust marketing strategies quickly without manual data collection.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a manual trigger to start the workflow.
3. Modify the "Set URL and Bright Data Zone" step with your desired Google Trends URL.
4. Connect your API keys for Google Gemini and Bright Data.
5. Test the workflow and check the email summary output.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with different Google Trends URLs. Observe how the summaries change based on the trending topics. Experiment with modifying the extraction parameters to see how it affects the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable insights to clients, helping them make data-driven decisions quickly. It positions you as a knowledgeable consultant in automation and AI, opening avenues for higher-value projects and recurring income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
