## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates daily meeting summaries using Google Calendar and AI. It retrieves events for the day, processes the data with an AI agent, and sends a summary back to a Slack channel, streamlining communication.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically summarize daily meetings and share insights with their team in Slack. This saves time and ensures everyone stays informed without manual note-taking.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Customize the "Google Calendar - Get Events" node to connect to your calendar.
3. Adjust the "Slack" node to target your desired channel.
4. Set the "Schedule Trigger" to your preferred time.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it summarizes and sends correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include specific keywords for filtering meetings (e.g., only summarize meetings with certain attendees). Run the workflow and check if it correctly identifies and summarizes those meetings.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you save hours in daily operations, improve team communication, and offer automation as a service. This positions you to attract more clients, increase efficiency, and generate income through your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note3" and "Google Gemini Chat Model" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
