### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Webhook** node to receive form submissions.
3. Use the **Twitter** node to search for relevant tweets every 30 minutes.
4. Add **Google Cloud Natural Language** nodes to analyze tweet sentiment.
5. Store results in **Strapi** with the **Store in Strapi** node.

### Practice
Try modifying the search term in the Twitter node to track a different topic or brand. Run the workflow and check if the results are stored correctly in Strapi, ensuring the sentiment analysis works as expected.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
