# Splitout Postgres Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving embeddingsOllama, documentDefaultDataLoader, textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Gmail Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Embeddings Ollama (embeddingsOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Default Data Loader (documentDefaultDataLoader)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Recursive Character Text Splitter (textSplitterRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Gmail Trigger (gmailTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Was manually triggered? (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Manual Trigger (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: No Operation, do nothing (noOp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Set before and after dates (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Extract email fields (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Store structured (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Store vectorized (vectorStorePGVector)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Create the table (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Explode interval into weeks (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Get a batch of messages (gmail)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting and storing email data. It retrieves emails from Gmail, splits their content, generates vector embeddings using AI, and stores structured and vectorized data in a Postgres database.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically analyze customer emails for insights. For instance, a retail store could categorize feedback, track complaints, and enhance customer service by embedding the data for better searchability.

### Imitate
1. Set up Gmail and Postgres nodes in n8n.
2. Create a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Use the Gmail Trigger to fetch emails.
4. Implement the Recursive Character Text Splitter to process email content.
5. Generate embeddings with the Embeddings Ollama node and store data in Postgres.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to extract only specific fields (like sender and subject) from emails. Test it with a few sample emails to see how the data is structured in Postgres and how embeddings are generated.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate tedious tasks, enabling businesses to save time and resources. By offering such automation services, you can attract clients, create value, and potentially generate a steady income stream.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Embeddings Ollama" and "Get a batch of messages" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
