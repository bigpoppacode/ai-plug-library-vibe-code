## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting text from a PDF document, analyzing it with OpenAI, and storing the results. It helps businesses streamline tasks like CV screening by providing insights into candidates' qualifications.

### Demonstrate
A recruitment agency can use this workflow to automatically screen CVs. When a candidate submits their CV, the workflow extracts relevant data, analyzes it against job requirements, and provides a summary report, saving time and improving decision-making.

### Imitate
1. **Set up n8n**: Create an account and install n8n.
2. **Create a new workflow**: Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. **Extract PDF**: Use the "Extract Document PDF" node to upload a CV.
4. **Analyze with OpenAI**: Set up the "OpenAI - Analyze CV" node to send extracted text for analysis.
5. **Store results**: Use a storage node (like Airtable) to save the analysis results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to analyze different document types (like Word documents). Upload a sample CV and adjust the extraction parameters to see how it affects the analysis output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently automate CV analysis, making you attractive to potential clients in recruitment. By showcasing this capability, you can differentiate your services and create value, leading to increased customer satisfaction and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Extract Document PDF" and "Parsed JSON" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
