# Stickynote Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving chatTrigger, chainLlm, lmOllama.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Basic LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Ollama Model (lmOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Structured Response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Error Response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: JSON to Object (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates chat message processing. When a message is received, it uses an AI model (Ollama) to generate a response, structures the output, and handles errors, ensuring seamless communication.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer support via chat. When customers message, they receive immediate, AI-generated responses, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing manual workload.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a "When chat message received" trigger.
3. Insert the "Basic LLM Chain" to process incoming messages.
4. Connect the "Ollama Model" to generate responses.
5. Use "Set" nodes for structured responses and error handling.
6. Test the workflow with sample messages.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the "Basic LLM Chain" node to see how different inputs affect the AI response. Experiment with various message types and observe the workflow's behavior.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer automation services, increasing efficiency for clients. It saves time, enhances customer interaction, and creates value, positioning you as a go-to expert in AI-driven automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "JSON to Object" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
