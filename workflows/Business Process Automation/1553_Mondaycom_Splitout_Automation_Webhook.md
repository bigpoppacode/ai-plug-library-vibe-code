## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of pulling subitems from Monday.com, processing them, and potentially uploading files to a specified location. It uses various nodes to manage data flow, enabling efficient data handling without manual intervention.

### Demonstrate
A project manager could use this workflow to automate the extraction of task subitems from Monday.com, compile them into a report, and upload that report to a shared drive. This saves time and ensures consistency in project tracking.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start the process.
3. Use the **PULL SUBITEMS** node to fetch data from Monday.com.
4. Process the data with the **SPLIT SUBITEMS** and **GET EACH SUBITEM** nodes.
5. If needed, add the **MONDAY UPLOAD** node to send files back to Monday.com.
6. Test the workflow and adjust parameters as necessary.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow that only pulls subitems from Monday.com and logs them into a Google Sheet. This will help you understand the flow of data and how to manipulate it within n8n.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your automation skills, allowing you to offer valuable services to clients or employers. Automating data handling saves time and reduces errors, making you a sought-after solution provider in the growing AI automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "SPLIT LINKED PULSES" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
