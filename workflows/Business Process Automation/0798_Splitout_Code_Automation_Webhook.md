# Splitout Code Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving splitOut, httpRequest, readWriteFile.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: Split Out (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Read/Write Files from Disk2 (readWriteFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Read/Write Files from Disk3 (readWriteFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: PDF Array (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Merge PDF (mergePdfs)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of merging multiple PDF documents. It starts by splitting data into separate parts, fetching PDFs via HTTP requests, saving them to disk, and finally merging them into a single PDF file.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically compile client reports from various sources into a single PDF for easy sharing, saving time and improving efficiency in report generation.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the process.
3. Use the Split Out node to handle input data.
4. Add an HTTP Request node to fetch the PDFs.
5. Use Read/Write File nodes to save PDFs to disk.
6. Implement a Merge PDF node to combine them.
7. Test the workflow to ensure it functions correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the URLs in the HTTP Request node to fetch different PDF files, then run the workflow to see how it merges them into a new document. Experiment with different combinations of PDFs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate document handling processes, making you more efficient and attractive to clients who need streamlined operations, ultimately helping you generate more income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Split Out" and "Merge PDF" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
