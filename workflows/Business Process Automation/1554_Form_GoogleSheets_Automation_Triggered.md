10. **Step 9: Quote DB (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Prod DB (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: General DB (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Order DB (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Other DB (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the handling of contact form submissions for an eCommerce business. When a form is submitted, it classifies the text, generates an AI response, sends relevant emails to various departments, and logs data in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline customer inquiries. For example, when customers submit requests for quotes or product info, the workflow automatically categorizes these requests and notifies the relevant departments, ensuring faster responses and better service.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a form trigger to capture submissions.
3. Add a text classifier to categorize messages.
4. Integrate OpenAI to generate responses.
5. Configure email nodes for each department.
6. Connect Google Sheets nodes to log data.
7. Test the workflow with sample submissions.

### Practice
Create a simple version of this workflow by setting up just one email notification for a specific category (e.g., "Request Quote"). Submit a test form and observe how the automation functions. Adjust parameters as needed to see real-time changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency. This skill can help you attract clients and generate income as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On form submission" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
