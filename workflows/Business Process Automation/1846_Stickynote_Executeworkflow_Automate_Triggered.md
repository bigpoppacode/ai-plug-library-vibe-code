# Stickynote ExecuteWorkflow Automate Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving executeWorkflowTrigger, chainLlm, outputParserStructured.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When Executed by Another Workflow** node.
2. **Step 1: When Executed by Another Workflow (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: LLM Bus (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: OpenRouter Chat Model (lmChatOpenRouter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Conform JSON (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of identifying OAuth service details based on a service name input. It uses an AI agent to extract information like authorization URI and token URI, then formats this data into a structured JSON output for further use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to quickly generate OAuth configurations for various APIs, saving time and reducing errors during integration with third-party services, such as setting up a new app with Google or Atlassian.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure the trigger node to accept your service name.
3. Set up the AI agent to retrieve OAuth details using the service name.
4. Use the structured output parser to format the results.
5. Test the workflow by running it with different service names.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the service names in the trigger node. Observe how the AI agent responds and modify the prompt to see how it affects the output. Document your findings on accuracy and confidence scores.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate the retrieval of OAuth details, making you invaluable to businesses needing quick API integrations. This skill can lead to increased client trust, repeat business, and higher income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When Executed by Another Workflow" and "Sticky Note6" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
