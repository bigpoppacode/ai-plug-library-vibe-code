# Manual Cron Automation Scheduled

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, mySql, cron.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: MySQL (mySql)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Cron (cron)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of purging records older than 30 days from a MySQL database. It can be triggered manually or set to run automatically at a specified time each day using a Cron job.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to keep their database clean. For example, a SaaS company could automate the deletion of old user activity logs to save storage space and improve database performance without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **MySQL** node with a DELETE query to remove records older than 30 days.
4. Optionally, add a **Cron** node to schedule this workflow to run daily at a specific time.
5. Connect the nodes and execute the workflow to test.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to delete records older than 60 days instead of 30. Change the query in the MySQL node and test it to see if it works as expected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you offer valuable database management services, making you more attractive to potential clients in need of automation. This can lead to increased sales, time savings, and enhanced operational efficiency for businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "Cron" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
