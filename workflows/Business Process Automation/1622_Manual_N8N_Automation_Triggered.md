# Manual N8n Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Map Workflows & Credentials (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Save to Database (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Chat Trigger (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Query Workflow Credentials Database (toolCode)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Window Buffer Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Workflow Credentials Helper Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: n8n (n8n)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of mapping workflow credentials, saving them to a database, and querying them using an AI agent. It starts with a manual trigger, processes data through various nodes, and utilizes OpenAI's chat model for querying.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to manage API keys and credentials for multiple services, ensuring they are securely stored and easily retrievable. This saves time during integration and prevents errors from manual handling.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to map your workflow's credentials.
4. Use a **Code** node to save these credentials to a SQLite database.
5. Add a **Chat Trigger** node for querying.
6. Use an **OpenAI Chat Model** node to process queries.
7. Test the workflow by executing it step-by-step.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow: change the database where credentials are saved or add a new service to the mapping process. Observe how these changes affect the workflow's functionality.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate the management of credentials, improving security and efficiency. This skill is valuable for offering automation services to clients, enhancing your business's appeal and income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "n8n" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
