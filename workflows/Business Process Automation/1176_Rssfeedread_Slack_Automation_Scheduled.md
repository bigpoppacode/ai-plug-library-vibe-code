## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking an RSS feed for new posts published yesterday and sends a summary of those posts to a Slack channel each morning.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to keep their team updated on industry news every morning without manually checking the RSS feed, enhancing productivity and ensuring timely communication.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Cron Trigger** to schedule it for every morning.
3. Use the **DateTime Node** to get yesterday's date.
4. Add the **RSS Feed Read Node** to fetch posts from your desired RSS feed.
5. Use an **If Node** to filter posts published after yesterday.
6. Add a **Function Node** to format the message.
7. Use the **Slack Node** to post the message to a specified channel.

### Practice
Try modifying the RSS feed URL in the workflow to track a different source or change the Slack channel where notifications are sent. Test it by executing the workflow and checking for updates in the new channel.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate information sharing, saving time and ensuring your team is always in the loop, which can enhance service offerings and attract clients looking for efficient communication solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
