# Filter Summarize Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, embeddingsOpenAi, textSplitterTokenSplitter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Notion - Page Added Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Embeddings OpenAI (embeddingsOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Token Splitter (textSplitterTokenSplitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Notion - Page Added Trigger (notionTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Notion - Retrieve Page Content (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Filter Non-Text Content (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Summarize - Concatenate Notion's blocks content (summarize)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Create metadata and load content (documentDefaultDataLoader)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Supabase Vector Store (vectorStoreSupabase)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates storing Notion pages as vector documents in a Supabase database. It triggers when a new page is added in Notion, retrieves the content, filters for text, summarizes it, generates embeddings with OpenAI, and finally saves it in Supabase.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically archive important Notion notes and documents as searchable vector data in Supabase, enhancing knowledge management and retrieval for their team.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Notion Trigger to monitor a specific database for new pages.
3. Use the Notion node to retrieve page content.
4. Implement a filter to exclude non-text items.
5. Summarize the remaining text.
6. Generate embeddings using OpenAI.
7. Save the summarized content to Supabase.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include an additional step that sends an email notification each time a new page is processed. This will help reinforce your understanding of workflow triggers and actions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data management tasks, save time, and offer valuable services to clients, enhancing your AI automation business and potentially increasing your income through efficient knowledge handling solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Supabase Vector Store" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
