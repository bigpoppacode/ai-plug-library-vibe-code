# Manual FTP Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, ftp, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **On clicking 'execute'** node.
2. **Step 1: On clicking 'execute' (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: FTP (ftp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: FTP1 (ftp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading an image from a URL, uploading it to an FTP server, and then listing the contents of the FTP directory. It starts when the user manually triggers it.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to automatically update their website logo stored on an FTP server. Instead of manually downloading and uploading the logo each time it changes, they can trigger this workflow to handle it instantly.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger node in n8n.
2. Add an HTTP request node to fetch an image URL.
3. Configure an FTP node to upload the image to your server.
4. Add another FTP node to list files in the upload directory.
5. Connect these nodes to create the workflow.

### Practice
Try modifying the URL in the HTTP request node to fetch a different image and see how the workflow updates. Check the FTP server afterward to confirm the new image is uploaded.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to save time on repetitive tasks and streamline your operations. As you build more automations, you can offer valuable services to clients, helping them operate more efficiently and potentially increasing your income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "HTTP Request" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
