# Postgres Code Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving splitInBatches, httpRequest, manualTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: find_video_data1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: fetch_last_registered (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: get_videos (youTube)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: if_is_empty (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Postgres (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: insert_items (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: create_table (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: remove_shorts (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: create_query (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: structure_data (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: if_empty (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: already_populated (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: map_data (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: sanitize_data (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: see table (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
22. **Step 21: drop table (postgres)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching YouTube video statistics for specified channels, storing the data in a PostgreSQL database, and filtering out videos based on specific criteria like duration and performance metrics.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to analyze video performance on their YouTube channel, identify trends, and optimize content strategy based on data-driven insights, ultimately increasing engagement and views.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up PostgreSQL and YouTube API credentials.
3. Modify the YouTube channel IDs in the manual trigger.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it fetches and stores video data correctly.
5. Adjust data filtering in the code nodes as needed.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that only fetches video statistics for one YouTube channel and logs the data to a Google Sheet. Experiment with different filtering criteria to see how it affects the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables students to offer valuable data analysis services, helping clients optimize their YouTube strategies. This skill can lead to increased customer acquisition, retention, and potential income through consulting or automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Loop Over Items" and "drop table" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
