# Supabase Stickynote Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving chatTrigger, agent, supabase.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Check If Session Exists (supabase)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: If Session Does Exist (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Assign Path To Session (supabase)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Define Path Values (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Postgres Chat Memory (memoryPostgresChat)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Get Correct Prompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates A/B split testing for chat interactions. When a chat message is received, it checks if a user session exists, assigns a random path (baseline or alternative prompt), and uses an AI model to generate responses based on the assigned path.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to test different marketing messages in real-time chat to see which resonates better with customers, helping to optimize engagement and conversion rates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook trigger for chat messages.
3. Configure a Supabase database for session management.
4. Define baseline and alternative messages in the "Define Path Values" node.
5. Test by sending chat messages and observing the responses.

### Practice
Create a mock chat environment and run the workflow. Send different messages to see how the AI responds based on the assigned prompts. Adjust the baseline and alternative messages to explore variations in responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable A/B testing services to businesses, enhancing their marketing efforts and potentially increasing revenue through optimized customer interactions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
