## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending recipe suggestions via email. It runs daily, retrieves recipes based on user-defined criteria (like ingredients and dietary preferences), and formats them into an HTML email.

### Demonstrate
A restaurant owner could use this workflow to send daily menu ideas to customers based on their dietary preferences, saving time on menu planning and improving customer engagement.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a Cron node to trigger daily.
3. Set up a Set node for search criteria (e.g., ingredients, calories).
4. Use Function nodes to format query values.
5. Add HTTP Request nodes to retrieve recipe data.
6. Create an HTML email body and send it via the Email node.

### Practice
Set up the Cron node to trigger every hour. Experiment with different ingredient inputs in the Set node and observe how the recipe suggestions change in the email output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate personalized customer interactions, which can improve engagement and retention, ultimately driving more sales for your automation service or business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Cron" and "Create Email Body in HTML" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
