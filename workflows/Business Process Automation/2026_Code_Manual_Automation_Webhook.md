### Explain
This n8n workflow automates posting content to a WordPress blog using XML-RPC. It collects settings like blog URL and credentials, prepares XML data for a new post, sends it via an HTTP request, and handles the response to check for success or errors.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically publish blog posts from a Google Doc or a form submission. This saves time and ensures consistent content posting without manual effort, helping maintain an active online presence.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Change the **Settings** node to include your WordPress blog URL, username, and application password.
3. Modify **contentTitle** and **contentText** with your desired post title and content.
4. Execute the workflow to test the blog post creation.

### Practice
Try creating a new post with different titles and content. Experiment with adding additional parameters in the **Settings** node, like categories or tags, to see how they affect the post on your WordPress site.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content creation for clients, saving them time and increasing their online engagement. This skill can help you attract more customers and generate income through automation services, positioning you as a valuable resource in the digital marketing space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Settings" and "HandleResponse" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
