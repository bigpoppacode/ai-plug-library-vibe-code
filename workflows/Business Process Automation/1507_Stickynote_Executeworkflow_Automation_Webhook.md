## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data retrieval from CoinMarketCap's DEXScan API, allowing users to gather real-time and historical information about decentralized exchanges, trading pairs, and market activity.

### Demonstrate
A crypto analyst wants to track the performance of various decentralized exchanges. This workflow automatically pulls live trading data, historical prices, and liquidity metrics, saving hours of manual research and enabling timely decision-making.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the CoinMarketCap API credentials.
3. Customize the parameters in the HTTP request nodes to target specific DEX data.
4. Activate the workflow to start retrieving data automatically.

### Practice
Run the workflow and modify one of the HTTP request parameters (e.g., change the DEX ID) to see how it affects the data retrieved. Note any differences in the output and how the workflow responds.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable market insights for clients in the crypto space, positioning you as a knowledgeable consultant and allowing you to create a service that automates financial data analysis for businesses, thus generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When Executed by Another Workflow" and "DEX Errors + IP Notice" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
