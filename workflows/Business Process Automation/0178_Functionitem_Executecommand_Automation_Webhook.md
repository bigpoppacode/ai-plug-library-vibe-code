## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the extraction of bank swift codes from a website. It starts with a manual trigger, fetches data from a URL, extracts the required HTML elements, processes country-specific pages, and saves the data to a MongoDB database.

### Demonstrate
A business owner may use this workflow to gather swift codes for multiple banks to integrate into their financial software, enhancing their service offerings and streamlining operations without manual data entry.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up n8n**: Install n8n on your server or use the cloud version.
2. **Create a New Workflow**: Start with a manual trigger.
3. **Add HTTP Request Node**: Fetch data from the swift codes website.
4. **HTML Extract Node**: Extract links to countries from the HTML response.
5. **SplitInBatches Node**: Process each country link individually.
6. **Repeat HTTP Request & HTML Extract**: Fetch and extract data for each country's page.
7. **MongoDB Node**: Save the extracted data to your database.
8. **Test and Execute**: Run the workflow manually to ensure everything works.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to extract additional data fields (like bank names or cities) from the same website and save that data to a different collection in MongoDB. This will help reinforce your understanding of data extraction and storage.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data collection, saving time and reducing errors in manual entry. This skill can attract clients needing efficient data handling solutions, enabling you to create value and generate income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On clicking 'execute'" and "MongoDB" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
