# Manual Code Automation Webhook

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, if.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Midjourney Generator (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get Midjourney URL (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Verify URL Acquisition (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Wait for Generation (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Get Random Image URL (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Generation 3-view Image with GPT-4o-Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Check if the URL is obtained (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Get Final Output (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Get Image (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of 3D figurine images by sending a prompt to the Midjourney API, waiting for the image to generate, and retrieving the final output, streamlining the design process.

### Demonstrate
A toy company wants to visualize new character designs. Using this workflow, they can automatically generate and retrieve 3D images from Midjourney based on creative prompts, saving time and enhancing their design process.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert an **HTTP Request** node to send a prompt to Midjourney.
4. Use another **HTTP Request** node to get the image URL.
5. Add **Wait** and **Code** nodes to handle the generation and retrieval of images.
6. Test the workflow by clicking "Execute."

### Practice
Create a simple workflow that generates a random image based on a fixed prompt and retrieves it. Experiment with different prompts and observe how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate creative processes, attract clients needing design automation, and potentially offer unique services in 3D modeling and visualization, enhancing your business value.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Get Image" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
