## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management by updating Todoist priorities based on a schedule and categorizing inbox tasks using AI. It retrieves tasks from Todoist, processes them, and updates their priority based on user-defined projects.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically prioritize daily tasks in Todoist based on urgency. For instance, every morning, it fetches tasks, assesses their importance, and updates their priority, ensuring the owner focuses on high-impact activities.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Schedule Trigger to run daily.
3. Connect your Todoist account and configure the "Get inbox tasks" node.
4. Define your projects and priorities in the "Your Projects" node.
5. Test the workflow to ensure tasks are categorized and priorities are updated correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to categorize tasks based on different criteria (e.g., due date or estimated time). Adjust the AI categorization prompt and see how it affects the priority assignments in Todoist.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you significant time in task management, allowing you to focus on strategic work. It can also help you offer automation services to clients, potentially increasing your income by providing them with tailored solutions that enhance productivity.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Update priority in todoist" and "If other or ai hallucinates" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
