# Manual FTP Automation Triggered

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving vectorStoreQdrant, manualTrigger, embeddingsOpenAi.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: Qdrant Vector Store (vectorStoreQdrant)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Embeddings OpenAI (embeddingsOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Default Data Loader (documentDefaultDataLoader)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Character Text Splitter (textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: List all the files (ftp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Loop over one item (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Downloading item (ftp)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of embedding documents into a Qdrant Vector Database. It fetches JSON files, processes them into smaller chunks, generates embeddings using OpenAI, and stores them in a vector store for semantic search.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to analyze and store large amounts of text data, like customer reviews or research papers, enabling quick retrieval and insights through a user-friendly search interface.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger to start the workflow.
3. Use the FTP node to list JSON files in a specified directory.
4. Loop through each file, download it, and process it into chunks.
5. Generate embeddings with OpenAI and store them in Qdrant.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to process a different type of data (e.g., CSV files). Change the data loader node to accommodate CSV, and ensure the embedding process works with the new format.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable data processing and retrieval services, helping businesses make informed decisions, enhance customer experiences, and ultimately drive revenue through efficient data management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Qdrant Vector Store" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
