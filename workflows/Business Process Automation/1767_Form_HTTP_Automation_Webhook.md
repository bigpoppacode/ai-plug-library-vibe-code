## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **YoutubeVideoURL** node.
2. **Step 1: YoutubeVideoURL (formTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: cleanedTranscript (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: processTranscript (function)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: extractTranscript (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow extracts transcripts from YouTube videos. It starts with a user submitting a video URL, processes the transcript data, and cleans it up for easier readability. The final output is a cleaned transcript ready for use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with a YouTube channel could use this workflow to automatically generate and clean transcripts of their videos, saving time on manual transcription and improving accessibility for viewers who prefer reading.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Webhook Trigger** to capture YouTube video URLs.
2. Add an **HTTP Request** node to fetch the transcript using the YouTube API.
3. Use a **Function** node to process and clean the transcript text.
4. Add a **Set** node to store the cleaned transcript for future use.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow that only fetches and displays the transcript of a single YouTube video. Modify the cleaning function to see how different text processing techniques affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable services like automated transcription for content creators, enhancing your appeal to potential clients and generating income through automation solutions tailored to their needs.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "YoutubeVideoURL" and "extractTranscript" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
