## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: List Invoices (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Inject s3 Subpath (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Set-Subpath (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: We do only Invoice Objects (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: It shouldn't be something else (stopAndError)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: ENV* (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Download Invoice PDF from Stripe (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Every Month the First Day of the Month (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Get all Invoices* (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Upload to S3 Bucket* (awsS3)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of downloading invoice PDFs from Stripe and uploading them to an AWS S3 bucket. It runs on a schedule, retrieves invoice data, filters for valid invoices, and organizes the files by year and month.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline monthly invoice management. Instead of manually downloading and organizing PDFs, the automation saves them time, ensures consistency, and reduces errors while keeping financial records organized in the cloud.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the Stripe and AWS S3 credentials.
3. Adjust the S3 bucket name and subfolder settings in the ENV* node.
4. Test the workflow using the "Test workflow" node to ensure it fetches and uploads invoices correctly.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow that only downloads invoices for the current month and saves them to a local folder. This will help you understand the data flow and node connections without the complexity of cloud storage.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to clients, helping them save time and reduce operational costs. As a consultant, you can charge for implementing similar automations, creating a recurring income stream while enhancing client efficiency.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Clean and Escape ENV" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
