# GoogleSheets Respondtowebhook Import Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note1**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/retell-dynamic-variables`
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "601", height: "1105"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "220", height: "300"
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "220", height: "300"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "220", height: "300"
7. **Get user in DB by Phone Number** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", filtersUI: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
8. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "json", responseBody: "={
  "call_inbound": {
    "dynamic_variables": {
        "first_name": "{{ $json['First Name'] }}",
        "last_name": "{{ $json['Last name'] }}",
        "email": "{{ $json['E-…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of populating dynamic variables for Retell voice agents using data from a Google Sheet. When a call comes in, the workflow receives a webhook call from Retell, extracts the caller's phone number, and looks up the corresponding user information in a Google Sheet. It then formats this data into dynamic variables and sends it back to Retell, enabling personalized interactions.

### Demonstrate
A customer service business could use this workflow to personalize automated responses to callers. By retrieving caller information from a database, the business can greet customers by name and tailor interactions based on their history, enhancing the customer experience.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets account and configure the sheet to include user data.
3. Set up a Retell webhook with the provided URL.
4. Test the workflow by simulating a call with a known phone number.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with sample user data, including phone numbers. Run the workflow with a test webhook call using one of these numbers, and verify that the dynamic variables are correctly populated in the response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer personalized customer interactions, improving service quality and client satisfaction. This capability can be marketed as a premium service in your automation business, attracting more clients and generating additional income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
