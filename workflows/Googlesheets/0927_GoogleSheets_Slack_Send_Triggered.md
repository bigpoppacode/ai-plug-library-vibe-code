# GoogleSheets Slack Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
  2. **Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `problems`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling user-submitted problems from a Typeform. It collects problem data via a Typeform trigger, logs it in Google Sheets, checks the severity of the problem, and if the severity is above 7, it sends notifications to a designated Slack channel and an email to a specified recipient. This ensures that critical issues are promptly identified and addressed.

### Demonstrate
A tech support team could use this workflow to quickly identify and respond to high-severity issues reported by users, ensuring swift action and improving customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Typeform, Google Sheets, Slack, and email credentials.
3. Adjust the severity threshold as needed.
4. Customize the Slack channel and email recipient.
5. Test the workflow with a sample Typeform submission.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform survey with a "severity" field, then submit a few entries. Observe how the workflow logs data in Google Sheets and sends notifications for entries with severity above 7.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer automated problem-tracking and alert systems to businesses, improving response times and customer service. This can increase your value proposition and potential revenue from automation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, googleApi, smtp, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
