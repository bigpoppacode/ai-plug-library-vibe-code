# GoogleSheets Slack Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
  2. **Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `problems`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling user-reported problems. When a user submits a form via Typeform, the data is appended to a Google Sheets document. The workflow then checks the severity of the problem. If the severity is greater than 7, it sends an alert message to a Slack channel and an email to a specified address, ensuring urgent issues receive prompt attention.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to manage customer support tickets. If a customer reports a critical issue, the workflow ensures the support team is instantly notified via Slack and email, enabling rapid response to high-priority problems.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform, Google Sheets, Slack, and email accounts.
3. Customize the Google Sheets range and the Slack channel to match your setup.
4. Test the workflow by submitting a form with different severity levels.

### Practice
Create a Typeform with a field for problem severity. Submit test forms with various severities and observe the workflow's response, ensuring it only sends alerts for severity levels above 7.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can improve your ability to offer efficient customer support solutions, enhancing client satisfaction and potentially increasing service revenue. It also positions you as a reliable provider of automation solutions in the AI business landscape.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, googleApi, smtp, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
