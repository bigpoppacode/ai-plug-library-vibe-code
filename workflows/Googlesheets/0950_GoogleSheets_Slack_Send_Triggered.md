# GoogleSheets Slack Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Slack**.
  2. **Slack** `slack` — channel/topic: `problems`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This workflow automates problem reporting by integrating Typeform, Google Sheets, and Slack. It starts with a Typeform submission, logs the data in Google Sheets, then checks if the problem's severity is greater than 7. If so, it sends an alert to a Slack channel and emails the details to a specified recipient. This ensures that critical issues are promptly highlighted and addressed.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to ensure that customer-reported issues are tracked and prioritized. For instance, if a customer reports a severe issue through a feedback form, the workflow ensures that the team is notified immediately via Slack and email, enabling a quick response.

- **Imitate**: To apply this workflow, set up a Typeform for issue reporting. Connect it to Google Sheets to log responses. Use an IF node to check severity levels. If the level is critical, configure Slack and email nodes to alert the team. Customize fields to match your data structure.

- **Practice**: Create a test Typeform with a "Severity" field. Submit test entries with varying severity levels. Observe how the workflow processes these entries, updating Google Sheets, and sending alerts only for high-severity issues.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by ensuring critical issues are never overlooked. It can improve client satisfaction and retention by demonstrating your ability to implement prompt and effective problem resolution systems, adding value to your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, googleApi, smtp, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
