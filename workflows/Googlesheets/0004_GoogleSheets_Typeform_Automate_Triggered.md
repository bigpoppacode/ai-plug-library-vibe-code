# GoogleSheets Typeform Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Sheets1**.
  2. **Google Sheets1** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**, sheet: `qwertzuiop`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the processing of feedback collected through a Typeform form. It evaluates the feedback based on its usefulness rating. If the rating is 3 or higher, the feedback is considered positive and appended to a Google Sheet labeled "positive_feedback". If the rating is below 3, it's deemed negative and appended to a different Google Sheet labeled "negative_feedback". This ensures feedback is organized and easily accessible for further analysis or follow-up actions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently categorize customer feedback from a course, allowing them to quickly identify areas for improvement and recognize what works well, ultimately enhancing the course content and customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Typeform and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up Typeform to trigger the workflow upon submission.
4. Customize the Google Sheets to match your feedback categories.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it categorizes feedback correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform survey and submit feedback with varying usefulness ratings. Run the workflow to see how it sorts the feedback into the respective Google Sheets. Try adjusting the rating threshold to see the impact on feedback categorization.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated feedback categorization services, saving clients time and improving their customer feedback processes. This can lead to new business opportunities and increased revenue through streamlined operations and enhanced customer insights.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** typeformApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
