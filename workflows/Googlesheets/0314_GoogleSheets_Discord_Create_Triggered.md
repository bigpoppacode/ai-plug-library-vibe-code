# GoogleSheets Discord Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On new or updated row**.
  2. **On new or updated row** `googleSheetsTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "402", height: "433", content: "## Send Google Sheets data as a message to a Discord channel
This workflow sends a message to a Discord channel when a new row is added or a row is updated in a Google Sheet. The m…[truncated]"
4. **Convert to ASCII table** `code` — jsCode: "/* configure columns to be displayed */
const columns_to_display = [
  "Security Code",
  "Price",
  "Quantity",
]

/* End of configuration section (do not edit code below) */
cons…[truncated]"
5. **Send message** `discord` — text: "=```
{{ $json.ascii_table }}
```", options: "[object Object]", webhookUri: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors a Google Sheet for new or updated rows. When a change is detected, it converts selected data columns ("Security Code", "Price", "Quantity") into an ASCII table format. This formatted data is then sent as a message to a specified Discord channel using a webhook, allowing for real-time updates and collaboration.

### Demonstrate
A stock trading firm could use this workflow to notify their team on Discord whenever there are updates to their investment data in Google Sheets, ensuring everyone is informed of the latest stock prices and quantities.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with columns for "Security Code", "Price", and "Quantity".
2. Create a Discord webhook for your desired channel.
3. Import the workflow into n8n.
4. Connect your Google Sheets and Discord accounts.
5. Test the workflow by adding or updating a row in your Google Sheet.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with sample data, then use the workflow to send changes to a Discord channel. Try modifying the data to see how the workflow reacts and updates the Discord channel in real-time.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time data monitoring and notification services. This can attract clients who need instant updates on critical data, enhancing your service offerings and increasing potential income in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsTriggerOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
