  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Sheets Trigger**.
  2. **Google Sheets Trigger** `googleSheetsTrigger` — event: "rowAdded", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
3. **Take a screenshot of a website** `websiteScreenshot` — urlInput: "={{ $json.Url }}"
4. **Store Screenshots** `googleDrive` — name: "={{ $json.Title }}.png", driveId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of taking screenshots of websites listed in a Google Sheet and storing them in Google Drive. When a new row with a URL is added to the specified Google Sheet, the workflow captures a screenshot of the website at that URL and saves it to a designated folder in Google Drive with the name based on the provided title in the sheet.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically capture and archive screenshots of competitor websites for market research, ensuring they always have up-to-date visuals for analysis and strategy planning.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with columns for "Url" and "Title".
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Connect your Google Sheets and Google Drive accounts.
4. Adjust the workflow to match your Google Sheet's document ID and folder ID in Drive.
5. Test the workflow by adding a new row in the sheet with a valid URL and title.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with a few sample URLs and titles. Run the workflow and observe how each new entry results in a screenshot saved in the specified Google Drive folder. Experiment by adding different URLs and checking the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated website monitoring services, providing clients with regular visual updates of their or competitors' online presence. This can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and generate additional income in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
