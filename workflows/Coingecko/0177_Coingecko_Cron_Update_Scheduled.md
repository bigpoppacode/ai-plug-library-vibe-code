# CoinGecko Cron Update Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Append Portfolio Value**.
  2. **Append Portfolio Value** `airtable` — operation: **append**, table: `Portfolio Value`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating and calculating the total value of a cryptocurrency portfolio stored in Airtable. It retrieves cryptocurrency data using CoinGecko, updates each asset's current price in Airtable, calculates the total portfolio value, and appends this total value to a separate Airtable table for tracking purposes. The workflow runs automatically at the top of every hour.

### Demonstrate
A cryptocurrency investor could use this workflow to keep track of their portfolio's value in real-time. By automating the update process, they ensure they always have the latest data without manually checking prices, improving their decision-making and investment strategies.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and CoinGecko accounts.
3. Schedule the workflow to run hourly using the "Run Top of Hour" node.
4. Customize Airtable tables to match your portfolio setup.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it updates prices and calculates total value correctly.

### Practice
Create a new Airtable base with sample cryptocurrency data. Run the workflow and observe how it updates prices and calculates the total value. Experiment by changing some cryptocurrency symbols to see if the workflow correctly retrieves and updates the data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer portfolio tracking services to clients, providing them with up-to-date investment insights. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and potentially increase your income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
