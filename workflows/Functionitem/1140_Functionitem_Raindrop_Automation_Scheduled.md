# FunctionItem Raindrop Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using manualTrigger, youTube, function.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Every 30 mins**.
  2. **Every 30 mins** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates the process of checking a YouTube playlist every 30 minutes for new videos and bookmarking them in Raindrop. It uses n8n to check a specified YouTube playlist, filter out new videos, and save them as bookmarks in Raindrop with relevant tags and titles.

**Demonstrate:**  
A content curator could use this workflow to automatically keep track of new videos from a favorite playlist, ensuring they never miss new content and can easily access it later for inspiration or sharing.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your YouTube and Raindrop accounts.
3. Set the YouTube playlist ID in the workflow.
4. Run the workflow to test and ensure it bookmarks new videos correctly.
5. Activate the workflow to run every 30 minutes.

**Practice:**  
Create a new YouTube playlist with a few test videos. Run the workflow and check Raindrop to see if the new videos are bookmarked. Try adding new videos to the playlist to see how the workflow handles them.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer automated content curation services, saving clients time and effort in keeping track of video content. This can enhance your service offerings and create new revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** youTubeOAuth2Api, raindropOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
