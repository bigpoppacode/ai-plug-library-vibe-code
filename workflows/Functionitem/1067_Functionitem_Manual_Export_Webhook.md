# FunctionItem Manual Export Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, manualTrigger, cron.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **NextCloud1**.
  2. **NextCloud1** `nextCloud` — path: `/=/n8n/Backup/lacnet1/{{$node["Merge"].data["name"]}}.json`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow automates the backup of workflows from n8n to Nextcloud. It retrieves a list of workflows from n8n, fetches each workflow's details, converts the data into a binary format, and uploads the backup files to a specified path in Nextcloud. The backup process is triggered manually or automatically every six hours.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to ensure all their n8n workflows are regularly backed up, protecting against data loss and enabling easy restoration in case of system failure.

- **Imitate**: 
  1. Import the workflow to your n8n instance.
  2. Connect your Nextcloud account in the NextCloud node.
  3. Adjust the Cron node to set your desired backup schedule.
  4. Test the workflow execution manually to ensure it backups correctly.
  5. Activate the workflow for automated backups.

- **Practice**: Create a few sample workflows in n8n. Run the backup workflow and verify that the workflows are correctly backed up to Nextcloud. Modify a workflow and run the backup again to see the updated backup.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated backup solutions to clients, ensuring data integrity and security. This service can be a valuable addition to your automation business, attracting clients who prioritize data protection.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
