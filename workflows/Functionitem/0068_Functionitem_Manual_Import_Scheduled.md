# FunctionItem Manual Import Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using httpRequest×2, manualTrigger, merge.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Run Daily at 2:30am**.
  2. **Run Daily at 2:30am** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow runs daily at 2:30 am to fetch a list of workflows from an n8n instance, processes the data, and uploads it to Google Drive. It starts by triggering the workflow list retrieval, maps the data, merges it, converts it to binary format, and finally uploads it as a JSON file to a specified Google Drive folder.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the backup of workflow configurations from their n8n instance to Google Drive, ensuring they have an up-to-date backup of their automations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your n8n and Google Drive accounts.
3. Set the correct Google Drive folder ID in the Google Drive node.
4. Schedule the workflow to run daily.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it uploads the JSON file correctly.

### Practice
Create a test workflow on your n8n instance and run this backup workflow. Check the Google Drive folder to see if the backup JSON file is created and contains the expected data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated backup solutions to businesses using n8n, providing them with peace of mind and data security. This can lead to additional income streams through setup fees and ongoing support contracts.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** httpBasicAuth, googleApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
