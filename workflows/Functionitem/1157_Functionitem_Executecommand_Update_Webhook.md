# FunctionItem Executecommand Update Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Triggered by **incoming email** (new message).
  2. **NotifyIncorrectPrice** `emailSend` — html: "=Please check the link or selector for the item with slug <strong>{{$node["initItem"].json["slug"]}}</strong><br>
URL: {{$node["initItem"].json["link"]}}", text: "=", options: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of monitoring product prices. It periodically checks the prices of specified items on websites and compares them to previously saved prices. If a current price is lower than the saved price, it sends an email notification with the new price. If the price extraction fails, it sends a notification to check the link or selector.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to monitor competitor pricing or track discounts on specific products. This helps in making timely decisions about pricing strategies or purchasing.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Set up a cron job to trigger the workflow every 15 minutes.
  3. Configure the web scraping selectors for the products you want to monitor.
  4. Customize email notifications with your email address.
  5. Test the workflow to ensure it captures and compares prices correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a test scenario with a few product URLs and CSS selectors. Run the workflow and observe how it handles price changes and errors. Modify product URLs or selectors to see how notifications are triggered.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer price monitoring services to e-commerce businesses, helping them stay competitive. This can expand your service offerings and increase your revenue as an automation consultant.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** smtp.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
