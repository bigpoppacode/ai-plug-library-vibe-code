# FunctionItem Executecommand Automation Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **MongoDB**.
  2. **MongoDB** `mongoDb` — collection: `swifts.meetup`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**: This workflow scrapes SWIFT codes from a website, processes them, and stores the data in a MongoDB database. It starts by retrieving country links, then scrapes SWIFT data page by page for each country. The data is processed to extract relevant fields such as names, SWIFT codes, cities, and branches, and is then inserted into the MongoDB collection `swifts.meetup`.

**Demonstrate**: A financial consultant could use this workflow to maintain an up-to-date database of SWIFT codes for their clients, enhancing their ability to facilitate international transactions swiftly and accurately.

**Imitate**: 
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Set up MongoDB and uProc credentials.
3. Modify the website URL if needed.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it scrapes and stores data correctly.
5. Schedule it to run periodically to keep data updated.

**Practice**: Create a test MongoDB database and run the workflow to scrape data from a different website. Observe the workflow's behavior and ensure all data fields are populated correctly in the database.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data scraping and database management services, essential for businesses needing real-time, accurate data for international operations, thereby increasing your service offerings and potential revenue streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** mongoDb, uprocApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
