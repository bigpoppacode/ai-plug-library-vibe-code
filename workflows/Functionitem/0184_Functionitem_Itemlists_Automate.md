  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow connects to a FileMaker database to retrieve contact information. It processes the data by splitting it into individual contact records and then extracts specific fields for each contact. The workflow is designed to efficiently manage and manipulate contact information stored in the FileMaker database.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the process of extracting customer contact information from a FileMaker database for marketing campaigns, ensuring that their CRM is always up-to-date with accurate data.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your FileMaker account.
3. Set up the trigger to run the workflow as needed.
4. Ensure the database, layout, and table parameters match your FileMaker setup.
5. Test the workflow to verify it processes and extracts contact data correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test FileMaker database with sample contact data. Run the workflow to see how it extracts and processes the data. Adjust the workflow to handle different fields or layouts and observe the results.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data extraction services to clients, enhancing their CRM systems and improving data management. This skill can increase your service offerings, leading to more business opportunities and potential income growth.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
