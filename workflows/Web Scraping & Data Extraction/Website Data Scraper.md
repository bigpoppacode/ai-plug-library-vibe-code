# Website Data Scraper

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving scheduleTrigger, httpRequest, filter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is designed to run on a schedule. Configure the interval in the Schedule node.
2. **Step 1: Schedule Trigger (scheduleTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: HTTP Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: HTTP Request1 (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Filter (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Loop Over Items (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Google Sheets (googleSheets)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Aggregate (aggregate)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of gathering business data from Google Maps, filtering it, and storing it in Google Sheets. It runs on a schedule, makes HTTP requests to extract business information, and organizes the data for easy access.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically collect and log information about local landscapers, like their contact details and ratings, every week. This helps in identifying potential partners or competitors without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Schedule Trigger** to run weekly.
3. Use the **HTTP Request** node to call the Google Maps API for business data.
4. Add a **Filter** node to keep only businesses with websites.
5. Use **Loop Over Items** to process each business.
6. Add another **HTTP Request** node if more data is needed for each business.
7. Finally, use **Google Sheets** to append the collected data to a spreadsheet.

### Practice
Set up a simple version of this workflow that collects data from a public API (like a weather API) instead of Google Maps. Log the results in a Google Sheet to understand the data flow and processing steps.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide valuable services to clients by automating data collection. This not only saves time but can also lead to new insights and opportunities, allowing you to charge premium rates for your automation expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Aggregate" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
