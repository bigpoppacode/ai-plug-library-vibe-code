## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of researching trending YouTube videos based on a keyword input. It scrapes video data, checks for duplicates, generates optimized titles and thumbnails using AI, and updates the results in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to find trending video topics for their content marketing strategy, ensuring their videos are SEO-optimized and engaging, thus attracting more viewers and increasing brand visibility.

### Imitate
1. Set up a form to collect keywords.
2. Create a "Webhook Trigger" in n8n to start the workflow.
3. Use an "HTTP Request" node to scrape YouTube data.
4. Add an "If" node to filter videos based on views and subscribers.
5. Use "OpenAI" nodes for title and thumbnail generation.
6. Update results in Google Sheets with a "Google Sheets" node.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional filters, such as video length or upload date, and see how it affects the results. Experiment with different keywords to observe variations in trending topics.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer valuable services to content creators and marketers, enabling them to optimize their video strategies, attract more viewers, and ultimately increase revenue, thus positioning you as an expert in automation and AI-driven solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "If" and "Outline Generator" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
