# Scraping Automation

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving httpRequest, stickyNote, wait.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Get Results** node.
2. **Step 1: Get Results (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Google Maps Actor (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sync Run (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Wait (wait)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting data from Google Maps using an API. It first initiates a search for specific locations (like plumbers in New York), then retrieves the results, waits for a specified time, and organizes the data for easy access.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to gather leads for local services. For example, a plumbing company could automate the search for local plumbers, analyze their presence, and use that data to target marketing efforts effectively.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add an **HTTP Request** node for the Google Maps API to initiate a search.
3. Configure another **HTTP Request** node to fetch results.
4. Use **Sticky Note** nodes to label workflow steps for clarity.
5. Implement a **Wait** node to manage delays in processing.
6. Test the workflow by running it and checking the output.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to search for a different service in another city. Change the search parameters in the Google Maps API call and observe how the results differ. This will reinforce your understanding of API calls and data extraction.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automation services to businesses, helping them save time and gather valuable data effortlessly. This skill can attract clients looking for efficient lead generation solutions, leading to potential income growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Get Results" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
