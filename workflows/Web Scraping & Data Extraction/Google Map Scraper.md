## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping Google Maps for business listings, extracting emails and URLs, filtering duplicates, and saving the results to a Google Sheet. It allows users to gather data without needing to manually collect it.

### Demonstrate
A small business owner wants to find local service providers' contact details for marketing outreach. This workflow can scrape Google Maps for relevant businesses, extract their emails, and store them in a spreadsheet, saving hours of manual work.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n manual trigger as the starting point.
2. Use an HTTP Request node to scrape Google Maps by entering the desired search URL.
3. Add nodes to extract emails and URLs from the scraped data using custom code.
4. Filter out duplicates and empty entries.
5. Use the Google Sheets node to store the results in your spreadsheet.

### Practice
Try running the workflow with a test Google Maps URL, modifying the search terms to see how it affects the results. Adjust the filtering criteria to understand how to refine the data output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you automate data collection for various business needs, making you a valuable asset for companies looking to streamline their operations. This skill can lead to client engagements, service offerings, and increased income through automation projects.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Add to Sheet (or whatever you want!)" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
