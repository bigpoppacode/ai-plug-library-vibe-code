# Bitbucket Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using bitbucketTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Bitbucket Trigger**.
  2. **Bitbucket Trigger** `bitbucketTrigger` — resource: **repository**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is triggered by a push event to a specified Bitbucket repository. When someone pushes changes to the repository named "test," the workflow initiates. This setup is typically used for automating tasks related to code changes, such as triggering CI/CD pipelines, notifying teams, or updating documentation systems.

### Demonstrate
A software development team could use this workflow to automatically trigger a build process whenever new code is pushed to the repository. This ensures that the latest code is always tested and deployed, maintaining a continuous integration and deployment cycle.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Bitbucket account using the API credentials.
3. Set the trigger to the specific repository you monitor.
4. Customize any subsequent actions you want to automate (e.g., sending notifications or initiating builds).
5. Test the workflow by pushing a change to the repository.

### Practice
Create a test Bitbucket repository and push some changes. Observe how the workflow triggers and consider adding an action, like sending a Slack notification, to see the full cycle in action.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to improve development processes, ensuring faster and more reliable deployments. As a consultant or developer, offering automated CI/CD solutions can attract clients looking to streamline their software development lifecycle, potentially increasing your income.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** bitbucketApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
