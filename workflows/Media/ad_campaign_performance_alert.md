# Ad Campaign Performance Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Ad Campaign Performance Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/ad_campaign_performance_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "ad_campaign_performance_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "ad_campaign_performance_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the monitoring and analysis of ad campaign performance. It begins with a webhook that receives performance data, which is then split and converted into embeddings using Cohere. These embeddings are stored in Pinecone, a vector database. The workflow uses OpenAI to analyze the data and determines insights or alerts. Finally, the results are logged into a Google Sheet for record-keeping and future reference.

### Demonstrate
A digital marketing agency could use this workflow to automatically analyze and log ad campaign performance data. This ensures that insights are generated quickly, and alerts are sent when performance metrics fall below expected levels, allowing for timely adjustments.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive campaign data.
3. Connect Cohere for embeddings and Pinecone for storage.
4. Use OpenAI for data analysis.
5. Log results in Google Sheets.
6. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure accuracy.

### Practice
Create a sample ad campaign dataset and send it to the webhook endpoint. Observe the workflow as it processes the data, generates insights, and logs results in Google Sheets. Modify parameters to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated ad performance monitoring services to clients, enhancing their marketing strategies. This can increase your service offerings and attract more clients, potentially boosting your income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, pineconeApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
