# Tv Rating Trend Report
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## TV Rating Trend Report", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/tv_rating_trend_report`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "tv_rating_trend_report"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "tv_rating_trend_report"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow processes TV rating data by receiving it via a webhook, splitting the text into manageable chunks, and converting it into vector embeddings. These embeddings are stored in a Redis vector store for trend analysis. The workflow utilizes AI to chat and analyze data, storing results in a Google Sheet for reporting.

**Demonstrate:**  
A TV network can use this workflow to automate the analysis of TV ratings data, quickly identifying trends and storing the insights for future programming decisions.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Redis and Google Sheets accounts.  
3. Set up a POST webhook to receive TV rating data.  
4. Customize the Google Sheet for storing analysis results.  
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure accuracy.

**Practice:**  
Create a mock dataset of TV ratings and test the workflow to see how it processes and analyzes the data. Modify the input data to observe changes in the analysis results.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide automated data analysis services to media companies, allowing them to make informed programming decisions. This skill can attract new clients and generate recurring revenue in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, redisApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
