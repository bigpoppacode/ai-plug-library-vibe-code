# Script Dialogue Analyzer
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Script Dialogue Analyzer", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/script_dialogue_analyzer`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "script_dialogue_analyzer"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "script_dialogue_analyzer"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow is designed to analyze script dialogues by processing them through a series of steps. It starts with a Webhook that receives script data, which is then split into manageable chunks. These chunks are converted into embeddings using Hugging Face and stored in Pinecone, a vector database. The workflow queries Pinecone to retrieve relevant data, utilizes OpenAI to generate insights or responses, and finally logs the results into a Google Sheet. This process helps in organizing and analyzing large sets of dialogue data effectively.

### Demonstrate
A film production company could use this workflow to analyze scripts for sentiment and dialogue patterns, helping writers improve character development and dialogue flow. It ensures scripts meet the intended tone and style.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook to receive script data.
3. Connect to Pinecone and OpenAI accounts.
4. Define Google Sheets for logging results.
5. Test the workflow with sample script data to ensure it processes and logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a short script and input it into the workflow. Observe how the script is chunked, processed, and logged. Modify the script to see changes in the analysis results, enhancing your understanding of the workflow's capabilities.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer script analysis services, providing valuable insights to writers and filmmakers. This can lead to new business opportunities and revenue streams in the creative industry, leveraging AI for content enhancement.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, pineconeApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
