  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Podcast Show Notes Generator", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/podcast_show_notes_generator`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "podcast_show_notes_generator"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "podcast_show_notes_generator"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the generation of podcast show notes. It starts by receiving podcast content via a webhook, which is then split into manageable chunks. These chunks are converted into vector embeddings using Cohere and stored in Supabase. The workflow queries these embeddings to retrieve relevant content, uses OpenAI to generate show notes, and logs the results in a Google Sheet for easy access and future use.

### Demonstrate
A podcast host could use this workflow to automatically generate detailed show notes for each episode, saving time and ensuring consistency. This enhances the podcast's SEO and provides listeners with structured insights into each episode's content.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n account and import the workflow.
2. Connect your Supabase, OpenAI, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Customize the webhook to receive your podcast content.
4. Set up Supabase to handle vector embeddings.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it logs the generated show notes in Google Sheets.

### Practice
Create a sample podcast script and run it through the workflow. Check the Google Sheet to see how the show notes are generated. Experiment with different podcast content to see how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated content services to podcasters, enhancing their content strategy and SEO. This can attract clients in the podcasting industry, creating a new revenue stream for your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
