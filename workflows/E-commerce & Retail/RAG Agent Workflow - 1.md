# RAG Agent Workflow   1

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving chatTrigger, lmChatOpenAi, memoryPostgresChat.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When chat message received** node.
2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Postgres Chat Memory (memoryPostgresChat)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Supabase Vector Store (vectorStoreSupabase)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Embeddings OpenAI (embeddingsOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Vector Store Tool (toolVectorStore)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: RAG Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a chat-based interaction where it receives a message, processes it with OpenAI's language models, and utilizes a vector database for context, providing intelligent responses based on stored memory and embeddings.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to create a customer support chatbot that answers queries in real-time, enhancing customer satisfaction by providing quick and accurate responses without human intervention.

### Imitate
1. Set up a chat trigger in n8n to receive messages.
2. Connect to OpenAI's API for initial message processing.
3. Use a Postgres database to store chat history.
4. Implement a vector store for context retrieval.
5. Create an AI agent to generate responses based on user input and stored data.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a new feature: log user queries into a Google Sheet after processing. This will help you understand data flow and integration with external services.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to build sophisticated AI-driven applications, enhancing your service offerings, attracting more clients, and generating additional income through automation solutions tailored to business needs.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "RAG Agent" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
