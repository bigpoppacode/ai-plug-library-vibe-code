  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Airtable Trigger: New Record**.
  2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **Window Buffer Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — sessionKey: "={{ $json.id }}", sessionIdType: "customKey"
4. **Airtable Trigger: New Record** `airtableTrigger` — table: `[object Object]`
5. **Background Info** `airtableTool` — table: `[object Object]`
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "660", height: "680", content: "# Welcome to my AI Social Media Caption Creator Workflow!

7. **Wait 1 Minute** `wait` — unit: "minutes", amount: "1"
8. **Get Airtable Record Data** `airtable` — table: `[object Object]`
9. **AI Agent** `agent` — text: "={{ $json['Briefing'] }}", options: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
10. **Format Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Post Caption into Airtable Record** `airtable` — operation: **update**, table: `[object Object]`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This workflow automates the creation of social media post captions using AI in an editorial plan stored in Airtable. It triggers when a new record is added in Airtable, waits a minute, fetches the record data, and uses an AI agent to generate a caption based on the briefing and background info stored in Airtable. The AI-generated caption is formatted and then updated back into the Airtable record.

- **Demonstrate**: A social media manager could use this workflow to streamline post creation, ensuring consistent and engaging captions that resonate with the target audience, saving time and maintaining brand voice.

- **Imitate**: Import the workflow into n8n, connect to your Airtable and AI accounts, set the Airtable table to your editorial plan, ensure fields for 'Briefing' and 'SoMe_Text_AI' exist, and test the workflow with sample data to see captions automatically generated and updated.

- **Practice**: Create a simple Airtable base with fields for 'Briefing' and 'SoMe_Text_AI'. Run the workflow with a few sample briefings to see how the AI generates and updates captions. Adjust the AI prompts to see different outputs.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow enhances your ability to automate content creation, making your services more appealing to clients seeking efficient social media strategies. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, airtableTokenApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
