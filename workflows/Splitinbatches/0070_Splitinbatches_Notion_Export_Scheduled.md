# Splitinbatches Notion Export Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Every day @ 2am**.
2. **Every day @ 2am** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain**: This workflow automatically runs every day at 2 am to check all Notion databases for pages with empty properties or blocks. If a page is empty, it archives the page to keep the Notion workspace organized and free from clutter.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner using Notion for project management can use this workflow to automatically clean up their workspace, ensuring only pages with content remain active. This helps maintain focus and efficiency.

- **Imitate**: 
  1. Import the workflow into n8n.
  2. Connect your Notion account.
  3. Set the workflow to active, ensuring it runs daily.
  4. Test with a Notion database containing empty pages to see how it archives them.

- **Practice**: Create a test Notion database with some pages having empty properties or blocks. Run the workflow and observe which pages are archived. Try adding content to some pages and see how it affects the workflow outcome.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can help keep your Notion workspace tidy, making it easier to manage projects and tasks. For consultants, offering Notion cleanup services can attract clients looking to optimize their digital workspaces, creating a new revenue stream.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
