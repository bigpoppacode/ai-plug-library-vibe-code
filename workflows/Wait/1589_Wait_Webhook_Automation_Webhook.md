# Wait Webhook Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Editor page**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1193", height: "479", content: "# Deliver the editor with links to the images"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1142", height: "502"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "506", height: "272", content: "# Send back edited image
## Add extra steps to save an edited image"
5. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/flux-fill`
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "360", height: "340"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "400", height: "300"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "280", height: "340"
9. **Mockups** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **NO OP** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
11. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combineBy: "combineByPosition"
12. **FLUX Fill** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.bfl.ml/v1/flux-pro-1.0-fill`
13. **Editor page** `html` — html: "<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Konva Image Editor</title>
…[truncated]"
14. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.html }}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of image editing using the FLUX Fill tool. It starts with a webhook that receives an image and user instructions. The image processing involves sending the image and instructions to FLUX Fill, which returns an edited version. The workflow checks if the editing process is complete and then sends back the edited image to the user through a webhook response.

**Demonstrate:**  
A graphic designer could use this workflow to automate repetitive image editing tasks, allowing them to focus more on creative aspects rather than routine edits. This could be especially useful for batch processing images for product catalogs.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook URL to receive image data and instructions.
3. Configure the FLUX Fill node with the necessary API credentials.
4. Test the workflow by sending an image through the webhook.
5. Verify that the edited image is returned correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test scenario where you upload an image with specific editing instructions through the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the image and returns the edited version. Adjust parameters to see different results.

**WIIFM (What's In It For Me):**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated image editing services, saving time and increasing efficiency. By integrating this into your business, you can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and potentially increase your income in the automation and AI service industry.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
