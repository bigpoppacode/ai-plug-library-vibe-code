# Wait Splitout Process Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Airtable Subprocess** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "260", content: "### Adjust if your monthly call limit exceeded
On the Team plan this means 2 requests per second [Source](https://support.airtable.com/docs/managing-api-call-limits-in-airtable#mon…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "2080", height: "1000"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "260", content: "## Run with test data
Connect to Set Fields"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "340", height: "320"
8. **Set Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "420", height: "580"
10. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "620", height: "420"
11. **random data** `debugHelper` — category: "randomData", randomDataType: "address"
12. **Split Out** `splitOut` — include: "allOtherFields", options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "records"
13. **Aggregate** `aggregate` — options: "[object Object]", aggregate: "aggregateAllItemData", destinationFieldName: "records"
14. **Airtable Batch** `executeWorkflow` — options: "[object Object]", workflowId: "[object Object]", workflowInputs: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow is designed to manage batch processing of records in Airtable. It processes data by splitting it into batches, performing operations like insert, update, or upsert (update or insert) based on specified conditions. The workflow manages Airtable's rate limits by implementing delays and retries if limits are exceeded, ensuring data integrity and efficient processing.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently update their product inventory in Airtable. By ensuring all updates are processed without exceeding API limits, they can maintain accurate stock levels and reduce manual data entry errors.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable account.
3. Set up the workflow to trigger on demand or on a schedule.
4. Define the records and fields you want to process.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it updates Airtable correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test Airtable base with mock data, then run the workflow. Observe how it updates records in batches. Experiment with different batch sizes and rate limits to see how it affects processing speed and efficiency.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer batch data processing services to clients, helping them maintain accurate databases while respecting API limits. This skill can enhance your service offerings and increase your potential income in automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** airtableTokenApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
