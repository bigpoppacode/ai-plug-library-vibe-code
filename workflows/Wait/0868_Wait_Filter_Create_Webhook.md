## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping Trustpilot reviews for a specified competitor using Bright Data's dataset API. Users input the competitor's Trustpilot URL and choose a timeframe for reviews. The workflow sends a request to Bright Data to fetch the reviews, waits until the dataset is ready, retrieves and stores the reviews in a Google Sheet, filters out negative reviews (1 or 2 stars), aggregates these reviews, and uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate Facebook ad copy based on the competitor's weaknesses. The final summary and ad copy are then emailed to the marketing team.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner might use this workflow to gain insights into competitors' weaknesses from Trustpilot reviews. This can help them craft targeted marketing strategies and create ad campaigns that address competitors' shortcomings.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Bright Data accounts.  
3. Set up a form to input the Trustpilot URL and select the review timeframe.  
4. Customize the Google Sheet template for your data storage.  
5. Run the workflow to test and ensure it processes and emails the data correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test Google Sheet and input some sample competitor Trustpilot URLs. Run the workflow and observe how it scrapes, filters, and processes the reviews, then generates ad copy. Adjust the prompts and test different scenarios to see the effect on the output.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer clients competitive analysis services, helping them optimize marketing strategies. This adds value to your AI automation business, attracting more clients and increasing revenue through enhanced service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, gmailOAuth2, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
