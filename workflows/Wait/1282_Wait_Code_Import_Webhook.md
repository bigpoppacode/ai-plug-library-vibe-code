# Wait Code Import Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1260", height: "460"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "1040", height: "500"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1040", height: "400"
5. **Once Per Day** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "1360", height: "380"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "620", height: "420", content: "[redacted]"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "920", height: "700"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "220", height: "220"
10. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — width: "2480", height: "1160", content: "[redacted]"
11. **Set API Keys** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Load Google Sheet** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", filtersUI: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain

This n8n workflow automates the creation of short-form videos for social media using AI tools. It starts by generating video captions from ideas in a Google Sheet, then uses OpenAI to develop detailed image prompts, which are subsequently transformed into images with the PiAPI service. These images are converted into videos using Kling, and voiceovers are added using Eleven Labs. The final video is rendered with Creatomate and uploaded to multiple social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. The workflow runs once daily, ensuring consistent content generation and distribution.

### Demonstrate

A digital marketing agency could use this workflow to consistently create engaging short-form videos for clients, enhancing their social media presence and driving more traffic to their platforms. This ensures a steady stream of creative content without manual intervention.

### Imitate

1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up API keys for PiAPI, Eleven Labs, Creatomate, and Google services.
3. Connect your Google Sheets with video ideas.
4. Run the workflow manually or schedule it for daily execution.
5. Customize prompts and API settings as needed for your video content.

### Practice

Create a Google Sheet with a few video ideas and environment prompts. Run the workflow to generate videos based on these ideas. Observe the process and tweak the prompts or settings to see how changes affect the output.

### WIIFM

Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated video content creation as a service, attracting clients seeking efficient social media marketing solutions. This capability can significantly boost your business by providing a scalable and innovative service, leading to increased revenue and customer satisfaction.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, openAiApi, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
