# Wait Schedule Monitor Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "340", content: "## Heads up!
To get this workflow running correctly, please enter your PG&E credentials below"
4. **Variables** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Create session** `airtop` — profileName: "cesar-prod", timeoutMinutes: "5"
6. **Create browser window** `airtop` — resource: **window**, url: `https://m.pge.com/`
7. **Type username** `airtop` — resource: **interaction**, operation: **type**
8. **Type password** `airtop` — resource: **interaction**, operation: **type**
9. **Close modal (if any)** `airtop` — resource: **interaction**
10. **Wait 5 secs** `wait` — configured for its default action.
11. **Go to "Energy Usage Details"** `airtop` — resource: **interaction**
12. **Go to "Energy Costs"** `airtop` — resource: **interaction**
13. **Go to "Electricity and Gas"** `airtop` — resource: **interaction**
14. **Extract Costs** `airtop` — resource: **extraction**, operation: **query**, prompt: "Extract the daily energy costs from the webpage content, including both natural gas and electricity costs. Format the information as a daily update email, listing the costs from th…[truncated]"
15. **End session** `airtop` — operation: **terminate**
16. **Send email** `gmail` — sendTo: "={{ $('Variables').item.json.Email }}", message: "={{ $json['data'].modelResponse }}", options: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving daily energy costs from PG&E's website, formatting the data into a daily update email, and sending it to a specified email address. It logs into the PG&E site using provided credentials, navigates to the relevant sections, extracts the cost data, and emails the formatted information.

### Demonstrate
A utility company might use this workflow to automatically gather daily energy cost data to monitor usage trends, ensuring they have up-to-date information for strategic decision-making and reporting purposes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Enter your PG&E credentials in the Variables node.
3. Set up the schedule trigger for the desired time.
4. Ensure the email address for receiving updates is configured.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it logs in, extracts, and emails the data correctly.

### Practice
Create a test PG&E account with mock data, then run the workflow. Observe how it logs in, extracts costs, and sends an email. Modify variables to simulate different scenarios, such as incorrect credentials, to see how the workflow handles errors.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow equips you with the ability to automate data retrieval and reporting processes, offering valuable services to businesses needing regular updates on energy costs. This can enhance your service offerings, leading to potential new clients and increased revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
