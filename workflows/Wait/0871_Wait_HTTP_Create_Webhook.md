# Wait HTTP Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On form submission - Amazon Reviews**.
2. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1280", height: "320"
3. **Sticky Note10** `stickyNote` — width: "195", height: "646", content: "In this workflow, I use Google Sheets to store the results. 

You can use my template to get started faster:

1. [Click on this link to get the template](https://docs.google.com/sp…[truncated]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "220", height: "440", content: "Add your competitors Amazon link here.
"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "940", height: "400"
6. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "820", content: "Adjust This Prompt with:
1. Add info about your company and offer.

2. The template requires the LLM to generate a summary of recent reviews but you can adjust it


"
8. **On form submission - Amazon Reviews** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Please Paste The URL of the Amazon Product", formFields: "[object Object]"
9. **HTTP Request- Post API call to Bright Data** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/trigger`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This workflow automates the process of collecting and analyzing Amazon product reviews. It starts by asking for an Amazon product URL, which is then sent to Bright Data to fetch reviews. These reviews are stored in Google Sheets, aggregated, and analyzed using OpenAI to summarize competitors' weaknesses. Finally, an AI-generated image is created based on the findings and sent via email for use in marketing campaigns.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner could use this workflow to monitor competitor products on Amazon, gain insights into their weaknesses, and leverage this data to enhance their marketing strategies, ultimately improving their product positioning.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Bright Data, Google Sheets, and OpenAI accounts.
3. Customize the workflow by adding your own Amazon product URLs.
4. Test the workflow to ensure reviews are collected and analyzed correctly.
5. Adjust the OpenAI prompt to suit your business needs.

**Practice:**  
Create a test Google Sheet and add a few Amazon product URLs. Run the workflow and observe how it collects, stores, and analyzes the reviews. Experiment with different prompts in the OpenAI node to see how it affects the summary.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer competitive analysis services to clients, helping them improve their products and marketing strategies. This can lead to increased client retention and the ability to charge premium rates for your automation expertise.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
