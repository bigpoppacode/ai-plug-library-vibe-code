# Wait Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **New espionage assignment**.
2. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `gpt-4o`
3. **Gmail** `gmailTool` — sendTo: "tom@sleak.chat", message: "={{ $fromAI("change", "What relevant part has changed on the website?") }}", options: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "260", height: "180", content: "## Note: almost never works right away
Adjust the prompts in the 'Tools agent' and 'Gmail' node as desired to steer the agent's behavior in the right direction"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "150", height: "80", content: "Connect your Firecrawl account"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "150", height: "80", content: "Connect your own OpenAI account
"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "150", height: "80", content: "Connect your own Gmail account
"
8. **New espionage assignment** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "New espionage assignment", formFields: "[object Object]"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "150", height: "80", content: "Connect your own OpenAI account
"
10. **convert message to website url & instruction** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
11. **parse results** `code` — jsCode: "const parsedObject = JSON.parse($('convert message to website url & instruction').first().json.choices[0].message.content);

return parsedObject"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to monitor changes on a website. It starts by receiving new espionage assignments through a form, which are converted into a website URL and instructions using OpenAI's API. The workflow scrapes the webpage to capture its contents, waits a day, and then scrapes it again to check for changes. If any changes are detected, an email is sent via Gmail to notify relevant parties about the updates on the website. This ensures that any modifications on the website are tracked and reported.

**Demonstrate:**  
A consultant might use this workflow to monitor a competitor’s website for updates. By detecting changes, they can keep track of new product launches or marketing strategies, allowing them to respond proactively.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your own OpenAI and Gmail accounts.
3. Set up the form to capture espionage assignments.
4. Configure the scraping tool with your Firecrawl account.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it sends email alerts for website changes.

**Practice:**  
Create a test website with a simple text page. Run the workflow to scrape the page and then change the text. After running the workflow again, check if you receive an email notification about the changes.

**WIIFM (What's In It For Me):**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer a valuable service to clients by monitoring competitors or important industry sites. This can enhance decision-making and strategy formulation, potentially boosting your consultancy's reputation and client base.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, gmailOAuth2, httpBasicAuth, httpHeaderAuth.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
