# Wait Splitout Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending multiple prompts to the Anthropic Claude API for batch processing. It submits an array of prompts, waits for the processing to complete, and retrieves the results. The workflow facilitates handling multiple queries in parallel, storing and managing chat memory, and filtering results for further use.

**Demonstrate**  
A developer might use this workflow to efficiently process multiple AI prompts in parallel, such as generating responses for a customer service chat system, where quick and simultaneous processing of queries is crucial.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up API credentials for Anthropic.  
3. Configure the prompts and 'anthropic-version' in the "One query example" node.  
4. Run the workflow manually or trigger it from another workflow.  
5. Check the results in the "First Prompt Result" and "Second Prompt Result" nodes.

**Practice**  
Create a test workflow with two different prompts. Execute it to observe how the results are processed and filtered. Modify the prompts and re-run to see how responses change with different inputs.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your skill set in AI automation, allowing you to offer efficient batch processing services. This can attract clients needing scalable AI solutions, thereby increasing your business's value and revenue potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** anthropicApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
