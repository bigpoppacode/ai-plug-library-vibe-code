# Wait Code Import Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "490.02125360646824", height: "538.1571460797832", content: "[redacted]"
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Get Carrier Codes** `httpRequest` — url: `https://test.api.amadeus.com/v1/reference-data/airlines`
5. **FromTo** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
6. **CarrierNameLookup** `code` — jsCode: "var carrierCodes={}
JSON.parse($('Get Carrier Codes').first().json.data).data.forEach(datum=>{
  carrierCodes[datum.iataCode] = {icao:datum.icaoCode, name:datum.commonName}
})

7. **Get Dates** `code` — jsCode: "const getNextSevenDays = () => {
    const dates = [];
    const today = new Date();

    for (const i of [7, 14]) {
        const nextDate = new Date(today);
        nextDate.setD…[truncated]"

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, oAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
