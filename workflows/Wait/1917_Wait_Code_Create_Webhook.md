# Wait Code Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking Test workflow**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "520", height: "200", content: "## Generate Graphic Wallpaper with Midjourney, GPT-4o-mini and Canvas APIs

3. **When clicking Test workflow** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "580", height: "280", content: "## Basic Params
In **Basic Params** node, you need to fill in your PiAPI key which you could check in [My Account](https://piapi.ai/workspace/my-account) on [PiAPI](https://piapi.a…[truncated]"

6. **Basic Params** `set` — mode: "raw", options: "[object Object]", jsonOutput: "[redacted]"
7. **Gpt-4o-mini API** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.piapi.ai/v1/chat/completions`
8. **Get Prompt** `code` — jsCode: "const image_prompt=$('Basic Params').first().json.image_prompt;

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of graphic wallpapers using Midjourney, GPT-4o-mini, and Canvas APIs. It starts when manually triggered, processes parameters like theme and style, generates an AI-driven graphic prompt, and then uses Midjourney to create an image. Finally, it designs a completed graphic using Canvas API, integrating both the image and text elements based on the input parameters.

### Demonstrate
A graphic designer could use this workflow to automate the creation of unique wallpapers for clients, saving time while ensuring each design is tailored to specific themes and styles, thus enhancing creative output and client satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Add your PiAPI key in the Basic Params node.
3. Set your preferred theme, scenario, style, and image prompt.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it generates and designs the graphic as expected.
5. Adjust Canvas API settings for final design tweaks.

### Practice
Create a test scenario where you use different themes and styles in the Basic Params node. Run the workflow and observe how the output changes. Experiment with different text and image combinations in the Canvas API to see how it affects the final design.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated, customized graphic design services, increasing efficiency and creativity. This can attract more clients and offer a competitive edge, potentially boosting your income as part of an AI-driven automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
