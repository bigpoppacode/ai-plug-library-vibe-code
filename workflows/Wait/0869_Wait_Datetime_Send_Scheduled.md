# Wait Datetime Send Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Calculator** `toolCalculator` — configured for its default action.
4. **Think** `toolThink` — configured for its default action.
5. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1120", height: "1200", content: "## Key Sections of n8n Workflow

**🟢 Schedule Trigger**
- Triggers the automation on the 5th of every month.
- Sets the cadence for monthly reporting.

**📅 Date & Time + 🧮 Previ…[truncated]"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "680", height: "560"
8. **Sticky Note11** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "675", height: "536"
9. **Date & Time** `dateTime` — options: "[object Object]"
10. **PreviousMonth** `code` — jsCode: "// Get the input date from the previous node
const inputDateStr = $input.first().json.currentDate;
const inputDate = new Date(inputDateStr);

// Move to the first day of the curren…[truncated]"
11. **Get Cost Centers with Budgets** `mySql` — operation: **executeQuery**
12. **CostCentrs** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
13. **Filter** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates monthly financial reporting. It triggers on the 5th of each month, retrieves and processes financial data from a database, analyzes it using an AI agent, and sends a detailed report via email. The workflow includes steps for calculating financial metrics, filtering data for specific cost centers, and formatting the output into an HTML report.

- **Demonstrate:** A financial analyst could use this workflow to automate the monthly preparation of financial performance reports for different departments, saving hours of manual data gathering and analysis.

- **Imitate:** 
  1. Set up your n8n environment and import the workflow.
  2. Connect your database and email accounts.
  3. Configure the schedule trigger for your reporting needs.
  4. Customize SQL queries to match your financial data structure.
  5. Test the workflow to ensure accurate data retrieval and reporting.

- **Practice:** Create a test database with financial data and run the workflow to generate a sample report. Modify the SQL queries or report format to better suit your business needs.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to streamline financial reporting processes, offering clients efficient, accurate, and timely insights. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase your income by providing high-value automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
