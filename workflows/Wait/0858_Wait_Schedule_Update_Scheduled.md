# Wait Schedule Update Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test workflow"**.
2. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1289", height: "2698"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "1420", height: "460", content: "Personal Data"
5. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "266.12865147126786", height: "627.5654650079845", content: "Run the workflow manually or activate it to run on schedule
"
6. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — width: "194.6864335083109", height: "525.6560478822986", content: "In this workflow, I use Google Sheets to store the results.

7. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1280", height: "320"
8. **Anthropic Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — model: `[object Object]`
9. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "1120", height: "580", content: "ICE BREAKER
"
10. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "2980", height: "1000"
11. **Run Workflow on a certain Schedule** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
12. **Get rows to enrich** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
13. **Adjust_input_for_loop** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the enrichment of LinkedIn profiles using Bright Data and generates personalized ice breakers with an AI model. It retrieves LinkedIn URLs from a Google Sheet, fetches profile data via Bright Data, and uses the Anthropic Chat Model to create ice breakers. The workflow updates the Google Sheet with enriched data and generated ice breakers.

### Demonstrate
A sales team could use this workflow to enhance their prospecting efforts. By automatically enriching LinkedIn profiles and generating personalized ice breakers, they can engage with potential clients more effectively, leading to higher conversion rates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Bright Data, Google Sheets, and Anthropic credentials.
3. Set up your Google Sheet with LinkedIn URLs.
4. Run the workflow manually or schedule it.
5. Check your Google Sheet for updated data and ice breakers.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with a few LinkedIn URLs. Run the workflow and see how it enriches the profiles and generates ice breakers. Adjust the workflow to fit your data structure and test again.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can elevate your sales strategies by enhancing personalization in outreach. It enables you to offer advanced prospecting services, increasing your value to clients and potentially boosting your income in the automation and AI business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
