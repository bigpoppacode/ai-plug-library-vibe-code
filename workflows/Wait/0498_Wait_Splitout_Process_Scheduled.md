# Wait Splitout Process Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1767.817629414989", height: "470.03830555074103", content: "## DROPCONTACT 250 BATCH ASYNCHRONOUSLY 
## 1500/HOUR REQUESTS
**Double click** to edit me. [Guide](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/sticky-notes/)"
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **PROFILES QUERY** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres, dropcontactApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
