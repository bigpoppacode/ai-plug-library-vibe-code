# Wait Code Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "220", content: "### 🎥Title is kept from the upload, alternatively you can just add the YT Title module in the mix 
# 👇🏻
"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", height: "200", content: "# Adjust the Prompts 👉🏻

# 👇🏻"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "620", height: "420"
6. **2.5FlashPrev** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "2000", height: "660"
8. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "180", content: "## Code only returns the videos that are not listed"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "220", height: "260"
10. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "280", height: "240"
11. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "3200", height: "660"
12. **Every Day** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
13. **Get Videos to reschedule** `youTube` — resource: **video**
14. **Get video Ids seperated** `code` — jsCode: "// Extract video IDs from YouTube search results
// This function processes all input items and creates separate items for each videoId

// Initialize empty array for our result it…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates YouTube video management. It fetches the latest videos, checks for updates, extracts transcripts, and generates SEO-optimized titles, descriptions, and tags using AI. It schedules unlisted videos for future publishing, ensuring each video is optimized for maximum reach and engagement.

- **Demonstrate:** A YouTuber could use this workflow to streamline video uploads. By automating video optimization, they save time and ensure consistent quality in titles, descriptions, and tags, enhancing discoverability and viewer engagement.

- **Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Connect your YouTube and AI credentials. 3. Set the schedule trigger for periodic checks. 4. Customize AI prompts for your content style. 5. Test the workflow to ensure video metadata updates correctly.

- **Practice:** Create a test YouTube channel and upload a few private videos. Run the workflow to see how it updates titles and descriptions. Adjust AI prompts and observe the changes in SEO optimization.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer YouTube optimization services, enhancing video visibility and engagement for clients. This expertise can lead to new service offerings and increased revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** youTubeOAuth2Api, openAiApi, googlePalmApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
