# Wait Limit Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "340", height: "320"
3. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1540", height: "1080"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "280", height: "300"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "300", height: "300", content: "## 👇Add Website Sitemap URL"
7. **Set Website URL** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Get List of Website URLs** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.sitemap_url }}`
9. **Convert to JSON** `xml` — options: "[object Object]"
10. **Create List of Website URLs** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "urlset.url"
11. **Filter By Topics or Pages** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
12. **Limit** `limit` — maxItems: "20"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping multiple pages from a website. It starts by retrieving the website's sitemap, converts it into a list of URLs, and filters them based on specific topics or pages. It then scrapes the content of these URLs using Jina.ai, extracts titles and markdown content from the pages, and saves the content to Google Drive for further use.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather content from a competitor's website for research purposes, ensuring they stay updated with market trends without manual effort.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set the sitemap URL in the 'Set Website URL' node.
3. Customize the filter conditions to target specific topics or pages.
4. Run the workflow to scrape and store content.

**Practice:** Create a test sitemap with several URLs. Run the workflow, adjust the filter conditions, and observe how it affects the URLs scraped and saved. This helps understand the impact of filtering.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer web scraping services, providing businesses with valuable insights and data without manual labor. This can lead to new opportunities and revenue streams in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
