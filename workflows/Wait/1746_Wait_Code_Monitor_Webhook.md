# Wait Code Monitor Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "300", height: "340"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "380", height: "480"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "400", height: "480"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "440", height: "400"
7. **Reads Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
8. **Cleans backlink url** `code` — jsCode: "return items.map(item => {
  let url = item.json['Backlink URL'];  // Get the URL from the current item's JSON
  let domain = url.match(/https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?([^/]+)/)[1]; 
  retur…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain**: This workflow automates the process of checking if backlinks listed in a Google Sheet are live and if they are "dofollow" or "nofollow". It reads backlink URLs from the sheet, sends them to DataForSEO for analysis, waits for results, and updates the sheet with the status of each backlink.

- **Demonstrate**: A digital marketing consultant could use this workflow to maintain the quality of a client's backlinks by regularly checking their status, ensuring SEO efforts are effective and up-to-date.

- **Imitate**: To apply this, import the workflow into n8n, connect your Google Sheets and DataForSEO accounts, set up the Google Sheet with backlink URLs and landing pages, and test the workflow to verify it updates the backlink status correctly.

- **Practice**: Create a Google Sheet with sample backlinks and run the workflow. Alter some URLs to test different statuses (live, lost, nofollow) and observe how the workflow updates the sheet.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing clients with valuable insights into their backlink profiles, improving their SEO strategy, and potentially increasing your income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, httpBasicAuth.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
