# Wait Manual Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Google Gemini Chat Model For Summarization** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
4. **Webhook HTTP Request** `toolHttpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://webhook.site/daf9d591-a130-4010-b1d3-0c66f8fcf467`
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "400", height: "320", content: "## Note

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scraping company data from Indeed using Bright Data's Web Unlocker, summarizing it with Google's Gemini AI, and storing the results in Airtable. It triggers manually, fetches data from a list of Indeed company URLs stored in Airtable, processes the data through AI for summarization, and sends the summarized data to a specified webhook URL.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to gather and process competitor data from Indeed, helping them to analyze market trends and make informed strategic decisions without manual data collection.

### Imitate
1. Set up Airtable with Indeed company URLs.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Connect your Airtable and Google Gemini accounts.
4. Configure the webhook URL to receive summaries.
5. Test the workflow using the manual trigger to ensure it processes and sends data correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Airtable base with a few company URLs, then run the workflow. Observe how it processes the URLs, summarizes the data, and sends it to your webhook. Adjust parameters to see how changes affect the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data scraping and analysis services, which can attract clients needing market insights. This capability can enhance your service portfolio, increase client retention, and generate additional revenue streams in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googlePalmApi, httpHeaderAuth, airtableTokenApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
