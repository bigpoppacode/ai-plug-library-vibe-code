# Wait Schedule Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the response to cybersecurity threats detected by CrowdStrike. It is scheduled to run daily and retrieves new detection data from CrowdStrike. Each detection is enriched with threat intelligence from VirusTotal. The workflow then creates a Jira ticket for each detection to ensure proper tracking and response and sends a notification to a designated Slack channel to alert the security team promptly.

**Demonstrate**  
A cybersecurity team can use this workflow to automate the threat response process, ensuring that new detections are immediately analyzed, documented, and communicated to the team, thus improving response times and reducing manual workload.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your CrowdStrike, VirusTotal, Jira, and Slack accounts.  
3. Schedule the workflow to run daily.  
4. Customize the Jira project and Slack channel settings.  
5. Test with sample detection data to ensure proper configuration.

**Practice**  
Create a test environment with a few detection events in CrowdStrike. Run the workflow and observe how it enriches the data with VirusTotal, creates Jira tickets, and sends Slack notifications. Adjust the settings to match your organization's needs.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your cybersecurity services, providing automated threat response solutions to clients. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and the potential to offer premium services, thereby generating additional income for your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** crowdStrikeOAuth2Api, virusTotalApi, jiraSoftwareCloudApi, slackOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
