# Wait Schedule Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Every day at 9pm** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "294", height: "80"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "327", height: "152"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "194", height: "80"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "600", height: "280"
7. **Get all Discord channels** `discord` — operation: **getAll**
8. **Cool down Discord API rate limits** `wait` — amount: "2"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain**: This n8n workflow automates the cleanup of Discord channels every day at 9 p.m. It retrieves all channels, fetches messages, filters out those older than seven days, and deletes them. It respects Discord API rate limits by pausing between actions to ensure smooth operations.

- **Demonstrate**: A community manager could use this workflow to keep Discord channels clutter-free by automatically removing outdated messages, enhancing user experience and compliance with data retention policies.

- **Imitate**: Import the workflow to n8n. Connect your Discord account. Set up your server details in the Discord nodes. Test the workflow with sample data. Activate the workflow to run daily, ensuring your channels remain clean without manual effort.

- **Practice**: Create a test server on Discord. Populate it with messages. Run the workflow and observe how messages older than seven days are deleted. Adjust the workflow to test different retention periods.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated channel management services to Discord communities, helping them maintain active and engaging environments. This can lead to new clients and increased revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
