# Wait Schedule Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Scheduled Start: Check for New Posts** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **(LLM Model for Concept)** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-001"
4. **(Parse Concept JSON)** `outputParserStructured` — schemaType: "manual", inputSchema: "{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "ideas": {
      "type": "array",
      "description": "An array containing exactly 1 content concept.",
      "minItems": 1,
      "max…[truncated]"
5. **(LLM Model for Prompts)** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-001"
6. **(Parse Prompts JSON)** `outputParserStructured` — schemaType: "manual", inputSchema: "{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "expanded_post_concept": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The elaborated visual concept, stating Single Image format and …[truncated]"
7. **(LLM Model for Caption)** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash"
8. **(Parse Caption JSON)** `outputParserStructured` — jsonSchemaExample: "{
	"Caption": "Thee future of call centers is here!"
}"
9. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "740", content: "# 01. Content Concept Generation

**Purpose:** This step uses Google Gemini to generate **one unique content concept** tailored for the specified platform (Instagram/LinkedIn), bas…[truncated]"
10. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "380", height: "740"
11. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "2", width: "740", height: "740"
12. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "620", height: "740"
13. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1160", height: "740"
14. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "380", height: "300"
15. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — configured for its default action.
16. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — width: "420", height: "240", content: "# 00. Scheduled Start & Input Preparation

**Purpose:** Initiates the workflow automatically based on the user-defined schedule. Fetches the next available post idea (Status=0) fro…[truncated]"
17. **1. Get Next Post Idea from Sheet** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", filtersUI: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
18. **2. Prepare Input Variables (Topic, Audience, etc.)** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
19. **3a. Generate Content Concept (Gemini)** `chainLlm` — text: "=", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
20. **3b. Generate Image Prompt Options (Gemini)** `chainLlm` — text: "=", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
21. **3c. Generate Post Caption (Gemini)** `chainLlm` — text: "=", messages: "[object Object]", promptType: "define"
22. **4. Generate Image using Prompt 1 (Replicate Flux)** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro-ultra/predictions`
23. **5. Prepare Data for Instagram API** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
24. **6a. Create Instagram Media Container** `facebookGraphApi` — edge: "media", node: "17841473009917118", options: "[object Object]"
25. **6b. Wait for Container Processing** `wait` — configured for its default action.
26. **6c. Publish Post to Instagram** `facebookGraphApi` — edge: "media_publish", node: "17841473009917118", options: "[object Object]"
27. **7. Update Post Status in Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **update**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation and posting of content on Instagram. It starts by scheduling a check for new content ideas from a Google Sheet. Using AI, it generates a content concept and image prompts, creates an image with Replicate, and generates a caption. The content is then formatted and posted to Instagram, and the status is updated in the Google Sheet to prevent duplicate processing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate their social media content creation and posting, ensuring a consistent online presence without manual effort. This saves time and allows the owner to focus on other business areas.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Sheet with content ideas.
2. Connect Google Sheets, Replicate, and Instagram APIs in n8n.
3. Configure the workflow to fetch ideas and generate content using AI.
4. Test the workflow with a sample idea to ensure it posts correctly.
5. Schedule it to run regularly for continuous content posting.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with sample post ideas. Run the workflow to see how it fetches ideas, generates content, and posts to a test Instagram account. Adjust the AI prompts and posting settings to match your brand style.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated social media management services, attracting clients who want to enhance their online presence without hiring a full-time social media manager. This can increase your income and expand your service offerings in the AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, googlePalmApi, httpHeaderAuth, facebookGraphApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
