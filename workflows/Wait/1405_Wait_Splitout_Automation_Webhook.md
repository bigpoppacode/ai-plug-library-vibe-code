# Wait Splitout Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "547.952991050529", height: "683.5200847858991"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "651.4454343326669", height: "252.64899257060446", content: "### Whisper transcribes and Open AI summarizes the podcast"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1189.7320416038633", height: "249.2202456997519", content: "### Get daily list of top podcasts (according to Apple charts) and download audio, then crop for OpenAI"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "645.0210885124873", height: "227.94126205257731", content: "### Finally, send the email!"
6. **Schedule** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "898.7483569555845", height: "387.3779915472271", content: "### Crop the podcast down before analysis"
8. **Genre** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **TaddyTopDaily** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.taddy.org/`
10. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "data.getTopChartsByGenres.podcastEpisodes"
11. **Download Podcast** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.audioUrl }}`
12. **Request Audio Crop** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.products.aspose.app/audio/cutter/api/cutter`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing top podcasts daily. It retrieves a list of the top podcasts in a specified genre, downloads, and crops the audio for analysis. The audio is transcribed using Whisper, and OpenAI summarizes it. The final summaries are compiled into an HTML email and sent to the user.

### Demonstrate
A podcast network could use this workflow to keep up with industry trends by receiving daily summaries of popular podcasts. This helps them stay informed and identify potential collaboration opportunities.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Taddy and OpenAI API keys.
3. Configure Gmail settings for sending emails.
4. Select the podcast genre in the Genre node.
5. Schedule the workflow to run daily.

### Practice
Create a test workflow that triggers manually. Replace the Schedule node with a Test Workflow node and run it to ensure the email with podcast summaries is received correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing podcast summary services to clients. This could attract podcast networks or media companies, offering them efficient content analysis and increasing your business value.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
