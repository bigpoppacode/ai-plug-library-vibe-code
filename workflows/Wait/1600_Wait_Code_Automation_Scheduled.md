# Wait Code Automation Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to improve cybersecurity by analyzing potential phishing URLs. It retrieves unread emails from Microsoft Outlook, scans the content for URLs using Python, and checks these URLs for threats with URLScan.io and VirusTotal. Results are consolidated and reported via Slack, helping to identify and mitigate phishing threats efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A cybersecurity consultant could use this workflow to automate the process of scanning emails for phishing links, ensuring that suspicious URLs are quickly identified and analyzed for threats, thereby improving organizational security and response times.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Microsoft Outlook, URLScan.io, and VirusTotal accounts.
3. Set up a schedule or manual trigger to run the workflow.
4. Customize Slack settings to receive alerts in your preferred channel.
5. Test the workflow with known URLs to ensure it functions correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Outlook account and send emails with various URLs, some legitimate and some known phishing links. Run the workflow and verify that it correctly identifies and reports the phishing URLs through Slack notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated threat detection services, enhancing security for clients and providing a valuable addition to your cybersecurity offerings. This can attract new clients and increase revenue by providing peace of mind through proactive threat management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** slackApi, microsoftOutlookOAuth2Api, virusTotalApi, urlScanIoApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
