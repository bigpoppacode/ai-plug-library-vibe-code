# Wait Code Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Run Daily at 9 AM** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "440", height: "360"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "440", height: "360"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "460", height: "360"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "380", content: "

















## Sibling Post [C]
Set 'ROOT' using URI/CID from the root post (Initial Post [A]).

For the PARENT, we use the URI and CID returned by the preceeding post (First…[truncated]"
7. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "220", height: "360"
8. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "940", height: "380"
9. **Set Bluesky Credentials** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **Create Bluesky Session** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createSession`
11. **Create Post Text** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "// Create the initial post text
const postText = "[initial post - visible]";

// Create the parent post object
const postData = {
    repo: $('Set Bluesky Credentials').first().jso…[truncated]"
12. **Create Initial Post** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.createRecord`
13. **Create Reply Text** `code` — jsCode: "// Create the reply text
const replyText = "[reply post - hidden]";

// Calculate timestamp 1 second from now
const futureDate = new Date(Date.now() + 1000);

// Create the reply p…[truncated]"
14. **Create Reply** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.createRecord`
15. **Create Sibling Text** `code` — jsCode: "// Create the sibling text
const siblingText = "[first sibling - hidden]";

// Calculate timestamp 2 seconds from now
const futureDate = new Date(Date.now() + 2000);

// Create the…[truncated]"
16. **Create Sibling** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.createRecord`
17. **Create Sibling Array** `code` — jsCode: "const items = [
    { id: 2, name: '[sibling two - hidden]' },
    { id: 3, name: '[sibling three - hidden]' },
    { id: 4, name: '[sibling four - hidden]' },
    { id: 5, name: '…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the process of creating and managing threads on the Bluesky social platform. It starts daily at 9 AM, authenticates with Bluesky using stored credentials, and creates an initial post. It then systematically creates a series of related posts (replies and siblings) by using information from previous posts to structure the thread. This ensures a coherent and connected conversation thread on the platform.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the posting of daily updates or announcements on Bluesky, ensuring that each post is part of a coherent thread. This can be useful for maintaining an organized communication stream on social platforms.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Enter your Bluesky handle and app password in the "Set Bluesky Credentials" node.
3. Schedule the workflow to run daily at 9 AM.
4. Customize the post texts in the code nodes to fit your content needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it posts correctly.

### Practice
Create a test Bluesky account and use the workflow to post a simple thread. Modify the content of the posts to experiment with different thread structures and observe how the workflow handles sequential posting.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated social media management services, enhancing your portfolio and attracting clients who need consistent and organized online presence. This skill can help you generate additional income by setting up and maintaining automated posting systems for businesses.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
