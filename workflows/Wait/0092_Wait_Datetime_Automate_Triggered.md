# Wait Datetime Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Wait**.
2. **Wait** `wait` — resume: "specificTime", dateTime: "={{$json["feedback_time"]}}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling meeting feedback. When a new meeting is scheduled via Calendly, it triggers the workflow. The meeting details are logged in Pipedrive, and a follow-up Slack message is scheduled to be sent 15 minutes after the meeting ends. This message prompts the meeting host to write their notes and confirm completion.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to ensure their team consistently captures meeting insights. By automating follow-up reminders, the workflow helps maintain detailed records, improving client service and internal communication.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Calendly, Pipedrive, and Slack accounts.
3. Set up triggers and mappings for meeting data.
4. Test by scheduling a meeting in Calendly and verifying the Slack notification.

### Practice
Create a test meeting in Calendly and observe how the workflow logs it in Pipedrive and schedules a Slack reminder. Modify the meeting details and test again to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enhances your ability to offer efficient meeting management solutions to clients. This can improve their operational efficiency and client interactions, making your services more valuable and potentially increasing your client base and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** calendlyApi, pipedriveApi, slackApi.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
