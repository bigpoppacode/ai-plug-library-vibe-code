# Wait Limit Import Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits  

**Want to learn how to do the same?**  
Inside [Digital Boss Code](https://bigpoppacode.io/go/dbc), I break it all down:

✅ The exact AI components that 3x your pricing overnight  
✅ My $15k Automation Framework using n8n + LangChain  
✅ Word-for-word scripts to close high-ticket deals  
✅ Real client case studies with templates  
✅ How to stop looking like a tech VA and start moving like a Solution Architect
