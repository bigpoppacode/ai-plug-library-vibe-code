# Wait Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Start**.
2. **Start** `formTrigger` — options: "[object Object]", formTitle: "Competitors Analysis for Service-Based Queries", formFields: "[object Object]"
3. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "=models/{{ $('Edit Fields').first().json['Google Gemini Model'] }}"
4. **Google Gemini Chat Model1** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "=models/{{ $('Edit Fields').first().json['Google Gemini Model'] }}"
5. **Google Gemini Chat Model2** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "=models/{{ $('Edit Fields').first().json['Google Gemini Model'] }}"
6. **Google Gemini Chat Model3** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "=models/{{ $('Edit Fields').first().json['Google Gemini Model'] }}"
7. **Google Gemini Chat Model4** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "=models/{{ $('Edit Fields').first().json['Google Gemini Model'] }}"
8. **Google Gemini Chat Model5** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "=models/{{ $('Edit Fields').first().json['Google Gemini Model'] }}"
9. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1020", height: "460", content: "[redacted]"
10. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Convert URLs to Items** `code` — jsCode: "// Get the raw input string from the "Start" node
const input = $('Start').item.json.Competitors;

// Split the string by line breaks and filter out any empty lines
const urls = in…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This workflow generates a comprehensive SEO blueprint for a service page by analyzing competitor websites and user intent. It starts by collecting competitor URLs and other inputs via a form. It then retrieves and processes HTML content from these URLs, extracting headings and meta information. Using Google Gemini models, it analyzes this data to understand competitor strategies and user needs. Finally, it synthesizes this information into a detailed blueprint report, which is converted into a text file for download.

**Demonstrate:** A digital marketing consultant could use this workflow to help a client improve their service page SEO. By analyzing competitors and user intent, the consultant can create an optimized content strategy that enhances the client's online visibility and conversion rates.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up your Google Gemini and Jina API credentials. 3. Customize the form fields for your specific needs. 4. Run the workflow by filling out the form with competitor URLs, target keywords, and other details. 5. Download the generated SEO blueprint file.

**Practice:** Create a test scenario by listing a few competitor websites and a target keyword. Run the workflow and analyze the output blueprint. Experiment by changing competitors or keywords to see how the blueprint adapts.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer high-value SEO consulting services. By providing clients with data-driven content strategies, you can help them achieve better search rankings, attract more visitors, and increase conversions, thereby enhancing your service offerings and generating income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googlePalmApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
