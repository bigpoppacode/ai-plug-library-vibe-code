# Wait Code Send Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **🤖 Each month** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", height: "230.21423635107112", content: "### Setup your location link and receiver email(s) here"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "3", height: "230.21423635107112", content: "###  Don't forget to connect a GMail account to this node!"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", content: "## Don't forget to activate the workflow here ☝️"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of collecting and emailing a monthly newsletter of events from a specified location. It scrapes event data from a webpage, formats it into an HTML newsletter, and sends it to specified email addresses. The workflow runs automatically each month.

**Demonstrate:**  
A concert promoter could use this workflow to automatically inform their subscribers about upcoming shows each month, reducing manual effort and ensuring timely communication.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Gmail account for sending emails.
3. Set up the location URL and recipient email addresses in the workflow.
4. Activate the workflow and test it to ensure it sends the newsletter correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test webpage with event listings and a test email account. Run the workflow to ensure it correctly scrapes event data, formats it into an email, and sends it to your test email account.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated newsletter services to clients, saving them time and improving communication efficiency. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase your income in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
