# Wait Code Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Get Keyword**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "400", height: "320", content: "## Type a Keyword and Discover What People Search on Google

This workflow scrapes Google autocomplete results by combining **your keyword** with every letter from **A to Z**.

3. **Get Keyword** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "480", height: "240", content: "## Exporting the Keywords

You can easily add a node to export the keywords in various ways:

- via a webhook
- by email
- as a file (e.g., saved to Google Drive)
- directly to a w…[truncated]"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "560", height: "280", content: "## Adapt the Language

Autocomplete results depend on the selected language.

You can change the `&hl=en` parameter in the **Google Autocomplete** node.  
Replace the `"en"` part w…[truncated]"
6. **Generate A-Z Queries** `code` — jsCode: "const keyword = $input.first().json.chatInput;
const alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".split("");

return alphabet.map(letter => ({

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of discovering search trends by scraping Google autocomplete suggestions. It takes a user-defined keyword and generates queries by appending each letter from A to Z. These queries are sent to Google's autocomplete service to retrieve popular search terms, which can be exported for further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A digital marketing consultant could use this workflow to identify trending keywords related to a product. This helps in optimizing content for SEO and creating targeted marketing campaigns, thus enhancing online visibility and engagement.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up a trigger to input your keyword.
3. Ensure the Google Autocomplete node is configured with the appropriate language.
4. Run the workflow to generate and retrieve keyword suggestions.
5. Adapt the export method to save results via email, file, or webhook.

### Practice
Create a test keyword list and use the workflow to generate autocomplete suggestions. Experiment with different keywords to see how the results vary. Modify the language parameter to observe changes in autocomplete suggestions from different regions.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer keyword research services, a valuable asset for businesses aiming to enhance their SEO strategies. This can attract clients seeking to improve their online presence, thereby generating income and expanding your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
