# Wait Code Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1260", height: "460"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "1040", height: "500"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1040", height: "400"
5. **Once Per Day** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "1360", height: "380"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "620", height: "420", content: "[redacted]"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "920", height: "700"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "220", height: "220"
10. **Set API Keys** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Load Google Sheet** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", filtersUI: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This workflow automates the creation of short videos for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram Reels. It starts by generating video ideas from a Google Sheet and uses AI to create image prompts. These prompts are used to generate images, which are then converted into videos. Voiceovers are generated and combined with the videos. The final video is rendered and uploaded to Google Drive, and a notification is sent via Discord.

**Demonstrate:** A content creator or marketing agency could use this workflow to quickly generate engaging short-form videos for social media campaigns, reducing manual effort and speeding up content production.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up API keys for PiAPI, Eleven Labs, Creatomate, and connect Google Sheets.
3. Load a Google Sheet with video ideas.
4. Run the workflow to automatically generate and upload videos.

**Practice:** Create a simple Google Sheet with a few video ideas and run the workflow. Observe how the ideas are transformed into videos and uploaded to Google Drive. Experiment with different prompts to see how they affect the final output.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated video generation services to clients, enhancing your service portfolio. This can lead to new business opportunities, increased client satisfaction, and the potential for recurring revenue in the AI automation industry.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleDriveOAuth2Api, discordWebhookApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
5. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
