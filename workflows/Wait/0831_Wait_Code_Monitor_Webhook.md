# Wait Code Monitor Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using stickyNote×4, set×3, redis×3.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Fetch Webhook Data & Declare lockValue**.
2. **Incoming Webhook Data** `webhook` — path: `/94d08900-4816-4c74-962a-aacff5077d5d`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "480", height: "220"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "220", height: "80"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "80", content: "Skips execution when duplicate request is received."
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", height: "80", content: "Deletes the Redis lock key to release the lock."
7. **Fetch Webhook Data & Declare lockValue** `code` — jsCode: "// Parse the Slack payload
const payload = JSON.parse($('Incoming Webhook Data').first().json["body"]["payload"]);

// Extract button action details
const var1 = payload.var1;

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow uses Redis to manage concurrent execution by implementing a locking mechanism. It starts with a webhook that receives data, then checks for an existing lock in Redis to prevent duplicate execution. If no lock exists, it sets one, processes the data, and upon completion, releases the lock. This ensures only one instance of the workflow runs at a time for the same input, avoiding duplicate processing.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer could use this workflow to prevent duplicate processing of payment requests in an e-commerce platform, ensuring each transaction is handled only once and avoiding issues like double charging.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive incoming data.
3. Configure Redis credentials.
4. Test with simulated data to ensure the locking mechanism prevents duplicate execution.
5. Adjust the workflow logic to suit your specific process needs.

**Practice:**  
Create a simple webhook in n8n and simulate multiple incoming requests. Observe how the locking mechanism prevents duplicates by ensuring only one request is processed at a time.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer robust, error-free automation solutions to clients, preventing costly mistakes in processes like payment handling. This skill can increase your value as a consultant and open opportunities for higher-tier projects and retainers.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** redis.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
