## üöÄ What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## üíº Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` ‚Äî rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "950", height: "680"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "850", height: "580"
5. **Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "810", height: "560"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "7", width: "530", height: "380"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` ‚Äî width: "480", height: "960", content: "## Try it out

10. **Get Recent Messages** `microsoftOutlook` ‚Äî operation: **getAll**
11. **Markdown** `markdown` ‚Äî html: "={{ $json.body.content }}", options: "[object Object]", destinationKey: "markdown"
12. **Message Classifier** `textClassifier` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", inputText: "=from: {{ $json.from.emailAddress.address }} <{{ $json.from.emailAddress.address }}>

## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain**: This n8n workflow automates the process of managing invoices received via email. It regularly checks an Outlook mailbox for new messages with attachments, identifies emails containing invoices using AI, downloads and processes these invoices to extract important data, and then uploads this data to an Excel workbook for further use. The workflow ensures that only relevant documents are processed, saving time and reducing manual errors.

- **Demonstrate**: A small business owner can use this workflow to automatically process supplier invoices received via email, extract necessary financial details, and update their accounting records in Excel, reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy.

- **Imitate**: To adapt this workflow, import it into n8n, connect your Outlook and Excel accounts, set the schedule to check emails, configure the AI to identify invoices, and map the extracted data fields to your Excel workbook. Test the workflow with sample emails to ensure it functions correctly.

- **Practice**: Create a test email account and send a few emails with different types of attachments, including invoices. Run the workflow to see how it handles these emails, and observe how it updates the Excel file with the extracted invoice data.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can significantly enhance your ability to offer automated invoice processing services to businesses, saving them time and reducing errors. This can broaden your service offerings, attract new clients, and generate income by providing a valuable, time-saving solution.

## üîß Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** microsoftOutlookOAuth2Api, googlePalmApi, microsoftExcelOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
