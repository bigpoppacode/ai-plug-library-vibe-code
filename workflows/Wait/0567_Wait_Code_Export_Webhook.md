# Wait Code Export Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Run Daily at 2 AM** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Set Bitbucket Workspace & Repository** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
4. **Get All Workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]", requestOptions: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the backup of n8n workflows to Bitbucket daily at 2 AM. It retrieves all workflows, checks if they are new or modified, and uploads them to a specified Bitbucket repository. If the workflow already exists, it verifies if changes have occurred and updates the repository if necessary, while managing API rate limits to ensure smooth operation.

### Demonstrate
A developer managing multiple automation workflows might use this workflow to ensure all their n8n workflows are backed up daily, safeguarding against data loss and facilitating version control.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Configure Bitbucket credentials and set your workspace and repository slugs.
3. Schedule the workflow to run daily at 2 AM.
4. Ensure the n8n API credentials are set up.
5. Test the workflow to verify it uploads workflows to Bitbucket.

### Practice
Create a test Bitbucket repository and run the workflow manually to see how it backs up a few sample workflows. Modify a workflow in n8n and rerun the workflow to observe the update process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated backup solutions to clients, ensuring data safety and version control. This skill can attract clients who rely on n8n for their operations, opening up opportunities for consulting and service contracts in automation management.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** n8nApi, httpBasicAuth.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
