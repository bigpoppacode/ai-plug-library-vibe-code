# Wait Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Start**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "580", height: "280", content: "## How-To
1. Claim your free Namesilo API key here: https://www.namesilo.com/account/api-manager

2. Set your API key and domains in "Set Data" node.

The workflow send up to 200 d…[truncated]"
3. **Start** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Set Data** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Convert & Split Domains** `code` — jsCode: "// Get domains from input JSON
const domains = $json.Domains.split("\n").map(domain => domain.trim()).filter(Boolean);

// Define batch size
const batchSize = 200;

// Split into b…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of checking the availability of domain names using the Namesilo API. It begins by setting up a list of domains and an API key, splits the domains into batches of up to 200, and then makes API requests to Namesilo to check each batch's availability. The results, indicating whether each domain is available or not, are compiled and exported into an Excel file for easy review.

### Demonstrate
A web hosting company might use this workflow to quickly check the availability of multiple domain names for their clients. This helps streamline the process of domain registration by ensuring that only available domains are offered to customers.

### Imitate
1. Obtain a Namesilo API key.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Add your API key and list of domains to the "Set Data" node.
4. Run the workflow manually or on a schedule.
5. Review the Excel output for domain availability.

### Practice
Create a list of 10 domains, some available and some not, and run the workflow. Observe how the results are reported in the Excel file, noting the availability status for each domain.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer domain availability checks as a service, saving clients time and effort. This capability can differentiate your services, attract new clients, and increase revenue by automating a critical step in the domain registration process.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
