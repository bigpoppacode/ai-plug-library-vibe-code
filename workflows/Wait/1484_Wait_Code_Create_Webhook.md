# Wait Code Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "280", content: "## Motion-illustration
This workflow is primarily designed to generate dynamic illustrations for content creators and social media professionals with APIs provided by PiAPI."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "200", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Basic Prompt** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.piapi.ai/api/v1/task`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the generation of motion illustrations using APIs from PiAPI. It starts by creating an image using a text prompt with the Midjourney API. Once the image is generated, it is randomly selected and sent to the Kling API for video generation. The workflow checks the status of each task and retrieves the final video URL once the process is complete.

### Demonstrate
A content creator could use this workflow to quickly produce engaging video content for social media, saving time and enhancing their visual storytelling with AI-generated animations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Add your PiAPI x-api-key in the Midjourney and Kling nodes.
3. Customize the image prompt in the Basic Prompt node.
4. Click 'Test workflow' to start the process and generate your video.

### Practice
Create a test workflow using a different image prompt and observe how the generated video changes. Experiment with various prompts to understand how input affects the output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer unique, AI-powered content creation services, attract more clients, and expand your automation business by providing innovative solutions for content creators and marketers.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
