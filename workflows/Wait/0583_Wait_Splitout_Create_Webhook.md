# Wait Splitout Create Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "547.952991050529", height: "683.5200847858991"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "651.4454343326669", height: "252.64899257060446", content: "### Whisper transcribes and Open AI summarizes the podcast"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "1189.7320416038633", height: "249.2202456997519", content: "### Get daily list of top podcasts (according to Apple charts) and download audio, then crop for OpenAI"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "645.0210885124873", height: "227.94126205257731", content: "### Finally, send the email!"
6. **Schedule** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "898.7483569555845", height: "387.3779915472271", content: "### Crop the podcast down before analysis"
8. **Genre** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
9. **TaddyTopDaily** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.taddy.org/`
10. **Split Out** `splitOut` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "data.getTopChartsByGenres.podcastEpisodes"
11. **Download Podcast** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.audioUrl }}`
12. **Request Audio Crop** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.products.aspose.app/audio/cutter/api/cutter`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of summarizing popular daily podcasts. It retrieves a list of top podcasts for a chosen genre from Taddy, downloads the audio, crops it for analysis, transcribes it using Whisper, and summarizes it with OpenAI. The summarized content is then sent to a specified email address.

**Demonstrate**  
A podcaster could use this workflow to keep up with industry trends by receiving daily summaries of top podcasts in their genre. This helps them stay informed without spending hours listening to each episode.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Taddy and Gmail API credentials.
3. Define your preferred podcast genre in the Genre node.
4. Schedule the workflow to run daily.
5. Test with the Test Workflow node to ensure summaries are correctly emailed.

**Practice**  
Create a test setup by selecting a different podcast genre. Run the workflow and compare the summaries to see how the workflow adapts to various genres. Adjust the schedule to see how timing affects email delivery.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer podcast summary services, saving clients time and enhancing their content strategy. This expertise can attract podcasters and media companies, boosting your automation business and income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** gmailOAuth2, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
