# Wait Code Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "500", height: "1340", content: "## Timer starts the Update every 24 hours and Read the Links out of a Google Sheets File (RSS-Links)"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "440", height: "1340", content: "## Each individual link is scanned and retrieved"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "480", height: "1340", content: "## Everything older than 3 days is removed"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "300", height: "1340", content: "## Each entry is saved individually with a waiting time in the Google Sheets file (RSS-Feeds), the waiting time is necessary as Google Sheets would otherwise receive too many hits …[truncated]"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "420", height: "1340", content: "## Reading the saved entries in the Google Sheets file (RSS-Feeds)"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "1340", content: "## Everything that is younger than 3 days will be removed, as we only want to delete the older entries!"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — width: "360", height: "1340", content: "## All entries older than 3 days are deleted here, again with a timer to prevent a Google API block! (RSS-Feeds)"
10. **Read Links** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing RSS feed entries through Google Sheets. It runs every 24 hours to read RSS links from a Google Sheet, fetches and processes each feed, and then filters out entries older than 3 days. The filtered entries are saved back to the Google Sheet, and older entries are deleted to maintain updated content.

**Demonstrate:**  
A content manager could use this workflow to keep a curated list of recent articles from various RSS feeds, ensuring only the latest content is available for review or publishing.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets account.
3. Schedule the trigger to run every 24 hours.
4. Modify the Google Sheets document IDs and sheet names to match your setup.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it reads, processes, and updates the RSS entries correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a Google Sheet with a list of RSS feed URLs. Run the workflow to see how it updates the sheet with the latest entries and removes old ones. Adjust the days filter to see how it impacts the content retention.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can help you manage content efficiently, ensuring you and your clients always have access to the most current information. This capability can enhance your service offerings in content management or digital marketing, leading to increased client satisfaction and revenue.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
