# Wait Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "460", height: "220", content: "[redacted]"
4. **Prompt** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.piapi.ai/api/v1/task`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of 3D model videos using the PiAPI service. It begins with a manual trigger and sends a POST request to generate a task that creates a 3D character design. The workflow checks the status of the image and video generation processes, retrieves URLs, and finally compiles a 360° or 180° spinning video of the model.

### Demonstrate
A design studio could use this workflow to streamline the production of 3D model presentations, saving time and enhancing consistency in their video outputs. This is particularly useful for showcasing new product designs or characters.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Input your PiAPI API key in the appropriate nodes.
3. Customize the prompt in the HTTP request node with your desired 3D model description.
4. Test the workflow by manually triggering it to ensure it generates the video as expected.

### Practice
Create a 3D model description and use this workflow to generate a video. Modify the prompt to see how different descriptions affect the output. Experiment with different settings to understand the impact on the final video quality and style.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated 3D video creation services, attracting clients in design and marketing sectors. You can increase your service offerings, improve efficiency, and generate additional income by leveraging AI-powered automations.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
