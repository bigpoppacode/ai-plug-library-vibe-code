# Wait Schedule Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest"
3. **Structured Output Parser** `outputParserStructured` — schemaType: "manual", inputSchema: "{
 "type": "array",
 "items": {
 "type": "object",
	"properties": {
		"type": {
 		"type": "string",
 "description": "type of regression. One of text, number, image, color or posit…[truncated]"

### This workflow implements an approach to Visual Regression Testing - a means to test websites for defects - using AI Vision Models.

16. **Get Webpages List** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", filtersUI: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
17. **Get URLs with Missing Base Images** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow performs visual regression testing on websites using AI vision models. It captures screenshots of web pages, compares them to a set of baseline images, identifies changes using Google's Gemini model, and logs the results. It helps detect unexpected changes or defects on web pages by leveraging AI to compare visual elements.

### Demonstrate
A web development agency could use this workflow to automatically monitor their clients' websites for visual changes after updates, ensuring that new deployments don't inadvertently alter the design or functionality of the sites.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Google Sheets and Drive, Apify, and Google Gemini accounts.
3. Set up a Google Sheet with URLs to test.
4. Schedule the workflow to run periodically.
5. Customize the Linear app node or replace it with your preferred reporting tool.

### Practice
Create a Google Sheet with URLs of sample web pages. Run the workflow to capture and compare screenshots, and observe how it logs detected changes. Experiment with different web pages to see how the workflow adapts to various visual changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated website monitoring services, ensuring consistent visual quality for clients. It adds value to your services, helping you attract and retain clients who need reliable web maintenance solutions, potentially increasing your revenue stream.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, googlePalmApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, httpQueryAuth, linearApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
4. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
