# Wait Schedule Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "740", height: "520"
5. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "740", height: "200", content: "## STEP 1 - GOOGLE SHEET
Create a [Google Sheet like this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C0Et6X3Zwr_6CxeNjhLpDwjAfIGeUvLGFawckKb0utY/edit?usp=sharing).

Please insert:
- …[truncated]"
6. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "740", height: "100", content: "## STEP 3 - MAIN FLOW
Start the workflow manually or periodically by hooking the "Schedule Trigger" node. It is recommended to set it at 5 minute intervals."
7. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — width: "740", height: "140", content: "[redacted]"
8. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — width: "180", height: "200", content: "Set API Key created in Step 2"
9. **Get new image** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", filtersUI: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]"
10. **Set data** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
11. **Create 3D Image** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://queue.fal.run/fal-ai/trellis`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**: This n8n workflow converts 2D images into 3D models by using a combination of Google Sheets to input image URLs and an AI service to process these images. It starts with a manual or scheduled trigger, retrieves image data from a Google Sheet, sends the image to an AI model to create a 3D representation, and updates the Google Sheet with the 3D model's URL. This automation streamlines the process of generating 3D images from existing 2D visuals.

**Demonstrate**: A business owner in the e-commerce sector might use this workflow to quickly convert product images into 3D models, enhancing their online store's visual appeal and providing customers with interactive product views.

**Imitate**: 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up a Google Sheet with image URLs. 3. Obtain an API key from the 3D service provider. 4. Configure the workflow to read from the Google Sheet, process images, and update the sheet with the 3D model links. 5. Test the workflow to ensure accuracy.

**Practice**: Create a sample Google Sheet with a few image URLs. Run the workflow to see how the images are converted into 3D models and how the Google Sheet is updated with the results. Experiment with different images to see variations in the output.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow enables you to offer a unique service of converting 2D images to 3D models, a valuable addition for businesses needing enhanced product presentations. This skill can attract clients in e-commerce, real estate, and digital marketing, potentially increasing revenue streams in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, googleDriveOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
