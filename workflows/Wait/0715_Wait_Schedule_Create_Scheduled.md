# Wait Schedule Create Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Every day at noon** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Every day at noon + 1mn** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Every hour** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
5. **Every day at midnight** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Every month** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "1780", height: "980"
8. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1100", height: "420"
9. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "960", height: "1340"
10. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "920", height: "1260"
11. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "800", height: "800", content: "# Daily Force Check

13. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "4400", height: "1880"
14. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1740", height: "800"
15. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "760", height: "360"
16. **variables2** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **variables1** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
18. **variables** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
19. **variables3** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
20. **variables4** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
21. **Get all musics not in youtube playlist** `supabase` — operation: **getAll**, table: `={{ $json.supabase_table_name }}`
22. **Get playlist snapshot** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**, operation: **get**
23. **Get all musics that should be in playlist** `supabase` — operation: **getAll**, table: `={{ $json.supabase_table_name }}`

29. **Playlist items to be deleted** `compareDatasets` — options: "[object Object]", mergeByFields: "[object Object]"
30. **Get playlist snapshot1** `spotify` — resource: **playlist**, operation: **get**
31. **Set youtube_video_id to null** `supabase` — operation: **update**, table: `={{ $('variables3').item.json.supabase_table_name }}`
32. **Remove Duplicates** `removeDuplicates` — compare: "selectedFields", options: "[object Object]", fieldsToCompare: "different.youtube_video_id.inputB"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This workflow synchronizes a Spotify playlist with a YouTube playlist. It checks for changes in the Spotify playlist, retrieves the current state of both playlists, and updates the YouTube playlist to match Spotify. It also handles deleted videos, duplicates, and errors, ensuring both playlists are in sync. It uses Supabase for database operations to track playlist items and their states.

**Demonstrate:** A music curator could use this workflow to keep their YouTube playlist updated with their Spotify playlist. This ensures that any changes made to the Spotify playlist, such as adding or removing tracks, are automatically reflected on YouTube, maintaining consistency across platforms.

**Imitate:** 1. Import the workflow into n8n. 2. Set up credentials for Spotify, YouTube, and Supabase. 3. Configure the Supabase table with the required structure. 4. Schedule the workflow to run at desired intervals. 5. Test with sample playlists to ensure synchronization.

**Practice:** Create a test Spotify playlist and a corresponding YouTube playlist. Add a few tracks to Spotify, then run the workflow. Check if the tracks appear on YouTube. Try removing a track from Spotify and see how the workflow updates YouTube.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer playlist synchronization services to content creators, ensuring their music presence is consistent across platforms. This can enhance their brand, increase their reach, and potentially lead to new clients and revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
