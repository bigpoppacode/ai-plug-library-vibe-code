# Wait DropBox Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "667.6107231291055", height: "715.2927406867177"
5. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "857.2064431277577", height: "463.937514110429", content: "## Testing for development"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "741.3069226712129", height: "336.57433650102917", content: "## Wait for file do be processed"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "402.63171535688423", height: "700.9473619571734"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "1752.5923360342827", height: "692.0175575715904"

10. **Load a test pdf file** `dropbox` — operation: **download**, path: `//valerian/w/prod/_freelance/ADEZIF/AI/Source data/Brochures pour GPT/Brochure 3M/3M_doc_emballage VERSION FINALE.pdf`
11. **Adobe API Query** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Query + File** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "mergeByPosition"
13. **Authenticartion (get token)** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `[redacted]`
14. **Create Asset** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://pdf-services.adobe.io/assets`
15. **Query + File + Asset information** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "mergeByPosition"
16. **Upload PDF File (asset)** `httpRequest` — method: **PUT**, url: `={{ $json.uploadUri }}`
17. **Process Query** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://pdf-services.adobe.io/operation/{{ $('Query + File + Asset information').item.json.endpoint }}`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:** This workflow is designed to process PDF files using Adobe's API. It begins by manually triggering the workflow to download a PDF file from Dropbox. The file is then uploaded to Adobe's service for processing, where various operations like extracting text or tables are performed. Once processed, the results are downloaded and handled accordingly, ensuring efficient PDF data extraction and transformation.

**Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automate extracting data from PDF invoices. This ensures accurate data entry into their accounting system, reducing manual errors and saving time.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Dropbox and Adobe API credentials.
3. Adjust the PDF file path in the Dropbox node.
4. Test the workflow by manually triggering it to ensure it processes a PDF and extracts data correctly.

**Practice:** Create a test PDF with tables and text, upload it to Dropbox, and run the workflow. Check if the extracted data matches your expectations. Modify the Adobe API Query node to extract different elements like images or tables.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can offer you a competitive edge in automating document processing tasks for clients, enhancing operational efficiency, and expanding your service offerings in the automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth, dropboxOAuth2Api, httpCustomAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
