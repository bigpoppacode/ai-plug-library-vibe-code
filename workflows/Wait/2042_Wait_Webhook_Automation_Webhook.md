# Wait Webhook Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Editor page**.
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1193", height: "479", content: "# Deliver the editor with links to the images"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "1142", height: "502"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "506", height: "272", content: "# Send back edited image
## Add extra steps to save an edited image"
5. **Webhook** `webhook` — path: `/flux-fill`
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "360", height: "340"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "400", height: "300"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "280", height: "340"
9. **Mockups** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **NO OP** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
11. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combineBy: "combineByPosition"
12. **FLUX Fill** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.bfl.ml/v1/flux-pro-1.0-fill`
13. **Editor page** `html` — html: "<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
 <title>Konva Image Editor</title>
 <script …[truncated]"
14. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "={{ $json.html }}"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to enhance and process images using the FLUX Fill API. It starts with a webhook that receives image data and a mask. The workflow then sends these to the FLUX Fill API to create an edited image. After processing, it checks the status of the request and retrieves the edited image once ready. The final image is then sent back to the user through the webhook response.

**Demonstrate:**  
A graphic design agency could use this workflow to automate the process of enhancing images based on client requirements, thus saving time on manual edits and ensuring consistency in output.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive image data.
3. Connect the FLUX Fill API with necessary credentials.
4. Map the input data to the API's parameters.
5. Test the workflow by sending an image and checking the edited result.

**Practice:**  
Create a simple test by uploading an image with a defined area to be edited. Run the workflow to see how it processes the image and returns the edited version. Experiment with different prompts and masks to observe changes.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated image editing services, enhancing your portfolio and attracting clients needing consistent, high-quality image enhancements. This can lead to increased revenue and a competitive edge in the automation business sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** httpHeaderAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
