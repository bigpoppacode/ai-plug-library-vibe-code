# Wait Webhook Send Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works

9. **Form Trigger** `formTrigger` — path: `/url-scan-form`
10. **Get List of URLs** `itemLists` — options: "[object Object]", fieldToSplitOut: "body.data"
11. **Set Email** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
12. **Is IP?** `if` — conditions: "[object Object]"
13. **Set IP** `set` — values: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
14. **DNS Lookup** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://dns.google/resolve`
15. **Set IP From Lookup** `code` — mode: "runOnceForEachItem", jsCode: "// Get the resolved IP address (last item in the Answer array)
const ip = $json.Answer.pop().data;

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
- **Explain**: This n8n workflow is designed to process URLs and IPs submitted through a webhook or form. It checks whether the input is an IP or a domain, resolves the domain to an IP if necessary, and then uses VirusTotal and GreyNoise APIs to perform threat intelligence checks. The results are compiled, and a summary report is sent via Slack and email to the user who submitted the request.

- **Demonstrate**: A cybersecurity consultant might use this workflow to automate the process of checking IPs and URLs for potential threats. This ensures quick and reliable threat assessments for clients, enhancing service efficiency and client trust.

- **Imitate**: 1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance. 2. Set up the necessary credentials for VirusTotal and GreyNoise APIs. 3. Customize the webhook or form for your specific input needs. 4. Ensure the Slack and email nodes are configured to send reports to the right channels and addresses. 5. Test the workflow to ensure it operates smoothly.

- **Practice**: Create a list of test URLs and IPs. Submit them through the form or webhook to see how the workflow processes them. Check the reports sent to Slack and email for accuracy and completeness. Adjust any configurations as needed.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow can significantly enhance your service offerings in cybersecurity. Providing automated threat assessments can attract more clients, improve customer retention, and increase revenue by offering advanced, automated security solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
