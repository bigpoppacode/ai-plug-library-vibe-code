# Wait Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When chat message received**.
2. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Click "Open Chat" after activating the workflow.

Here, paste in a job description or describe your ideal candidate."
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "300", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "300", content: "For the first condition: {{ $json.start }} is less than 50, so change "50" to your desired number of results. 

Each loop fetches the next page, returning 10 results per iteration."
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "5", width: "200", content: "Waits 5 seconds to avoid rate limiting by Google. While it's unlikely you'll be rate-limited since you're authenticated with your cookie, this is just a precaution."
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "380", height: "280"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — content: "Connect your google sheets account and create a document."
9. **Generate a Boolean Search String** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
10. **Create a new sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **create**
11. **Columns to add** `code` — jsCode: "return [{
  json: {
    "linkedin_url": ""
  }
}];
"
12. **Add columns to new sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **set page number for google search** `code` — jsCode: "return [{ json: { start: 0 } }];
"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of finding LinkedIn profiles based on a job description. When a chat message with a job description is received, it uses OpenAI to generate a Boolean search string. This search string is used to perform a Google search, extracting LinkedIn URLs from the search results. These URLs are then stored in a new Google Sheets document, with the process repeating until the desired number of results is reached.

**Demonstrate:**  
A recruiter could use this workflow to automate the process of sourcing potential candidates from LinkedIn based on specific job requirements, saving time and effort in manually searching for profiles.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your OpenAI and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up a chat trigger to receive job descriptions.
4. Customize the number of desired LinkedIn profiles.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it stores the profiles in Google Sheets.

**Practice:**  
Create a test job description and trigger the workflow. Observe how it generates search strings, performs searches, and stores LinkedIn profiles. Adjust the search criteria and test different job descriptions to see how the results vary.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated candidate sourcing services to recruitment agencies, increasing your service offerings and providing significant time savings. This could lead to increased revenue and customer satisfaction in your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, httpHeaderAuth, openAiApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
