# Wait Code Automation Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using manualTrigger, n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore, wait.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **On clicking 'execute'**.
2. **On clicking 'execute'** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Customer Datastore** `n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore` — operation: **getAllPeople**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow retrieves a list of people from a Customer Datastore, processes them in batches, and merges the results. It starts with a manual trigger, retrieves data, loops over items in batches, waits, checks if looping is done, and merges the loop items.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to efficiently process large customer datasets in batches, reducing processing times and managing resources effectively.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Customer Datastore.
3. Configure the `Loop Over Items` node to define batch size.
4. Test the workflow with a manual trigger to ensure it processes and merges data correctly.

### Practice
Create a mock Customer Datastore with sample data. Run the workflow and observe how it processes items in batches and merges results. Adjust batch sizes to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to handle large datasets efficiently, enhancing your data processing capabilities. This skill is valuable for businesses needing to manage extensive customer information, offering opportunities to provide data processing services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
