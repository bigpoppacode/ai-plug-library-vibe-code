# Wait Redis Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using redis×11, noOp×3, set×3.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **OpenAI Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
4. **When chat message received** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
5. **When Executed by Another Workflow** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "700", height: "780"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "920", height: "940"
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "1200", height: "820"
9. **Mock input data** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
10. **get wait seconds** `code` — jsCode: "// Function: Compute waitSeconds
const wordCount = $json.message.split(' ').filter(w=>w).length;
return [{ json: { 
  context_id: $json.context_id,
  message: $json.message,
  wait…[truncated]"
11. **Buffer messages** `redis` — operation: **push**
12. **Set buffer_count increment** `redis` — operation: **incr**
13. **Set last_seen** `redis` — operation: **set**
14. **Get waiting_reply** `redis` — operation: **get**
15. **Mod input** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]", includeOtherFields: "true"
16. **waiting_reply?** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
17. **No Operation, do nothing2** `noOp` — configured for its default action.
18. **Set waiting_reply** `redis` — operation: **set**
19. **WaitSeconds** `wait` — amount: "={{ $json.waitSeconds }} "
20. **Get last_seen** `redis` — operation: **get**
21. **Get buffer_count** `redis` — operation: **get**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow manages chat message processing by buffering messages, computing wait times based on message length, and ensuring messages are consolidated before being sent to an AI model for processing. It uses Redis to manage message states and coordinates these steps to handle chat messages efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A customer support center could use this workflow to manage incoming chat messages, ensuring that messages are consolidated and processed efficiently by an AI model. This helps in delivering quick and accurate responses to customers, improving service quality.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Redis and OpenAI credentials in n8n.
3. Configure the triggers to connect with your chat platform.
4. Customize message handling logic as needed.
5. Test the workflow with sample chat inputs to ensure proper operation.

### Practice
Create a test chat environment and send different length messages to see how the workflow buffers and processes them. Adjust the wait time logic and observe how it affects message processing and response times.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer chat management solutions, enhancing customer interaction for businesses. This can lead to improved customer satisfaction and potentially increase your value as a service provider in AI-driven automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, redis.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
