# Wait Code Update Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Execute Workflow"**.
2. **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Read Google Sheets** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting and analyzing website content from a list of domains stored in a Google Sheet. It retrieves the website content, cleans it, and uses OpenAI to extract key business details such as the value proposition, industry, target audience, and whether the company is B2B or B2C. The results are then updated back into the Google Sheet.

**Demonstrate**  
A consultant could use this workflow to quickly analyze competitor websites, gathering insights on their market positioning and target audience. This data can help in strategic planning and refining marketing tactics.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Google Sheets and OpenAI accounts.  
3. Set the Google Sheet with domains to analyze.  
4. Execute the workflow to fetch, analyze, and update company data.  
5. Customize the nodes to suit your specific analysis needs.

**Practice**  
Create a small Google Sheet with 3-5 domains. Run the workflow to see how it extracts and analyzes data. Modify some domains to test the robustness of the workflow and observe how changes are reflected in the output.

**WIIFM**  
By mastering this workflow, you can offer competitive analysis services, helping businesses understand their market better. This can lead to consulting opportunities, enabling you to generate income through strategic insights and automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
