# Surveymonkey Automate Triggered
## 🚀 What It Does
Automates a flow using surveyMonkeyTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **SurveyMonkey Trigger**.
2. **SurveyMonkey Trigger** `surveyMonkeyTrigger` — event: "response_created", surveyIds: "288506979", objectType: "survey"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow is set up to listen for new survey responses from SurveyMonkey. When a response is created for a specific survey (ID: 288506979), this workflow is triggered. The SurveyMonkey Trigger node is configured to authenticate using OAuth2, ensuring secure access to survey data.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather customer feedback as soon as it's submitted. This real-time data collection can help quickly identify trends, address issues, and improve customer satisfaction, leading to better business outcomes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow to n8n.
2. Connect your SurveyMonkey account via OAuth2.
3. Set the SurveyMonkey Trigger node to the desired survey ID.
4. Test the trigger by submitting a dummy response to the survey.
5. Ensure the workflow activates upon receiving a new response.

### Practice
Create a test survey on SurveyMonkey and link it to this workflow. Submit a few test responses and observe how the workflow is triggered. Adjust the survey ID and authentication settings as necessary to ensure accurate response handling.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to automate customer feedback collection, allowing businesses to efficiently gather insights and respond quickly. This capability can enhance your service offerings, attract new clients, and generate additional revenue streams in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** surveyMonkeyOAuth2Api.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
