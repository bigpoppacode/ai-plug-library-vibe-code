# Daily Student Motivation
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Daily Student Motivation", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/daily-student-motivation`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "daily_student_motivation"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "daily_student_motivation"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Daily Student Motivation':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of delivering daily motivational messages to students. It begins with a Webhook Trigger, which initiates the workflow upon receiving a POST request. The workflow then processes the data using a series of nodes: it splits the text, generates embeddings with OpenAI, and stores this data in a Weaviate vector database. The RAG Agent processes the data to generate motivational content, which is then logged into Google Sheets. If an error occurs, an alert is sent to a Slack channel.

**Demonstrate:**  
A school could use this workflow to send daily motivational messages to students, enhancing their engagement and morale, particularly during remote learning or exam periods.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the Webhook Trigger with a POST method.  
3. Connect your OpenAI, Weaviate, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.  
4. Customize the motivational content and test the workflow.  
5. Activate the workflow to start sending messages daily.

**Practice:**  
Create a test webhook and simulate sending a POST request with sample motivational content. Ensure the workflow processes the data correctly and updates Google Sheets, while also handling any errors by sending a Slack alert.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated motivational messaging services to educational institutions, thus expanding your service offerings and potentially increasing your revenue in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
