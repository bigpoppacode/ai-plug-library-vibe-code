# API Stats Chart
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: API Stats Chart", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/api-stats-chart`
4. **Pinecone Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
5. **Pinecone Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'API Stats Chart':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of an API stats chart. It starts with a webhook trigger that receives data, splits the text, and generates embeddings to store in Pinecone. A query retrieves relevant data, and an AI agent processes it to generate insights, which are appended to a Google Sheet. If errors occur, a Slack alert is sent.

### Demonstrate
A developer could use this workflow to automate the analysis of API usage data, generating insights for performance monitoring and capacity planning. This saves time and ensures consistent data processing and reporting.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the webhook to receive API data.
3. Connect Pinecone and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Customize the text processing and AI agent configurations.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it generates the desired insights.

### Practice
Create a sample API data set and run the workflow. Observe how the data is processed, stored, and reported. Modify the AI agent's prompt to experiment with different insights and outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer automated data analysis services. This expertise can attract clients looking for efficiency in monitoring API performance, providing a competitive edge in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
