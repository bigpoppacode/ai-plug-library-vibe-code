# Blood Test Email Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Blood Test Email Alert", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/blood-test-email-alert`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "blood_test_email_alert"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "blood_test_email_alert"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Blood Test Email Alert':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the processing of blood test data received via a webhook. It starts by splitting and embedding the incoming data, storing it in a Supabase database. The workflow then uses AI to analyze the data and append the results to a Google Sheet. If an error occurs, a Slack alert is sent.

**Demonstrate:**  
A healthcare provider could use this workflow to automatically process and store patient blood test results, ensuring accurate record-keeping and timely alerts for any critical findings.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive data.
2. Connect to Supabase to store and query data.
3. Use AI nodes to process data.
4. Append results to Google Sheets.
5. Set up Slack for error alerts.

**Practice:**  
Create a test webhook to simulate receiving blood test data. Run the workflow to see how data is processed and stored. Modify test data to observe different results and error handling.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data processing solutions, reducing manual errors and increasing efficiency. This skill is valuable for creating healthcare automations, attracting clients, and generating income in an AI-driven business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
