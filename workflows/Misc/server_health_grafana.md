# Server Health Grafana
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Server Health Grafana", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/server-health-grafana`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "server_health_grafana"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "server_health_grafana"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Server Health Grafana':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `embed-english-v3.0`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the monitoring of server health using Grafana data. It starts with a webhook to receive server data, processes it with AI to analyze health status, stores information in a Weaviate vector database for context, and logs results in Google Sheets. Alerts are sent to Slack if errors occur.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to track server performance automatically. If a server shows signs of failure, the workflow alerts the IT team on Slack, allowing them to respond quickly and reduce downtime.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive server data.
3. Connect Weaviate, Cohere, and Slack accounts.
4. Customize the Google Sheets and Slack settings.
5. Test the workflow with sample server data to ensure alerts and logs are functioning.

### Practice
Create a test webhook and send mock server data to it. Observe how the workflow processes this data, updates Google Sheets, and sends alerts to Slack. Modify the data to trigger error conditions and test alert responses.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer proactive IT monitoring services, enhancing server reliability for clients. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and potential upselling of additional IT management services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
