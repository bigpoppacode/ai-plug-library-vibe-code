# Onboarding Checklist Slack
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Onboarding Checklist Slack", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/onboarding-checklist-slack`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "onboarding_checklist_slack"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "onboarding_checklist_slack"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Onboarding Checklist Slack':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling onboarding data through Slack. When a POST request is received at a specified webhook, the data is processed, split into text chunks, and embedded using OpenAI's text embedding model. The embeddings are stored in Supabase, queried for context, and then processed by a RAG Agent using Anthropic's chat model. The results are appended to a Google Sheet, and any errors trigger a Slack alert.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business could use this workflow to automate the onboarding process, ensuring that each new employee's data is processed, analyzed, and stored efficiently, with notifications sent for any errors.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.  
2. Set up a POST webhook and connect your Supabase, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Sheets accounts.  
3. Customize the text processing and Slack alert settings.  
4. Test the workflow with sample onboarding data to ensure it operates as expected.

**Practice:**  
Create a sample onboarding form and send data to the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the data, stores embeddings, and logs results. Modify the workflow to handle different data structures or add additional processing steps.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can streamline onboarding processes, reduce manual data handling, and enhance data-driven decision-making. Offering such automation solutions can attract clients looking to optimize their HR operations, thus expanding your service offerings and potential revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
