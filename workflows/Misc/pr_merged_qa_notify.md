# Pr Merged Qa Notify
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: PR Merged QA Notify", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/pr-merged-qa-notify`
4. **Pinecone Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
5. **Pinecone Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'PR Merged QA Notify':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `embed-english-v3.0`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow automates notifications for when a pull request (PR) is merged. It starts by receiving a webhook signal, processes the data using a text splitter and embeddings to create a vector representation, and queries a vector database (Pinecone) to retrieve relevant context. An AI model processes this data to produce a response, logging results in Google Sheets. If errors occur, alerts are sent to Slack.

**Demonstrate:**  
A developer could use this workflow to instantly notify their QA team when a PR is merged, ensuring they have all the necessary context to begin testing. This speeds up the development cycle and reduces communication delays.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow to n8n.  
2. Connect your webhook to a GitHub PR merge event.  
3. Configure Pinecone and Google Sheets nodes with your credentials.  
4. Set up Slack for error notifications.  
5. Test the workflow by merging a PR and checking the results.

**Practice:**  
Create a test repository and simulate a PR merge to see how the workflow processes the data and sends notifications. Modify the Google Sheets logging format to better suit your team's reporting needs.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer clients automated QA notifications, reducing their development cycle time and increasing efficiency. This skill can enhance your service offerings and attract more business, generating additional income streams.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, pineconeApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
