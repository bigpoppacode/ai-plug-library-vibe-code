# Hourly Weather Log
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Hourly Weather Log", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/hourly-weather-log`
4. **Pinecone Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
5. **Pinecone Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Hourly Weather Log':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `embed-english-v3.0`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of logging hourly weather data. It starts with a Webhook Trigger that receives weather data via a POST request. The data is then split into manageable chunks, converted into vector embeddings, and stored in a Pinecone vector database for efficient querying. The workflow uses a Chat Model to process the data, appends the processed information to a Google Sheet for record-keeping, and sends alerts via Slack if any errors occur.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically log and analyze weather data for agricultural planning. By maintaining a detailed and organized log, they can make informed decisions about crop management and resource allocation.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Webhook Trigger in your n8n instance.
2. Connect Pinecone and Google Sheets to n8n.
3. Configure the Chat Model for data processing.
4. Set up a Slack channel for alerts.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample weather data via POST request.

### Practice
Create a test webhook in n8n and simulate sending weather data. Observe how the data is processed, logged in Google Sheets, and stored in Pinecone. Modify the workflow to handle different data formats or additional data points.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data logging and analysis services. This can attract clients in agriculture, logistics, or any industry reliant on weather data, expanding your service offerings and boosting your automation business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, pineconeApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
