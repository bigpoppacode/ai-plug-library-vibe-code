# CRM Patient Intake
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: CRM Patient Intake", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/crm-patient-intake`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "crm_patient_intake"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "crm_patient_intake"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'CRM Patient Intake':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the CRM patient intake process. It starts with a Webhook Trigger receiving patient data, then processes it through Weaviate to store and query vectorized data. The workflow uses a Chat Model to analyze the data, and a RAG Agent to enhance responses with relevant information. It logs outcomes in Google Sheets and sends alerts via Slack if errors occur, ensuring efficient data handling and error notification.

**Demonstrate:**  
A healthcare provider could use this workflow to streamline patient intake, ensuring data is efficiently processed and errors are promptly reported, enhancing patient management and reducing manual data entry errors.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Weaviate, Anthropic, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.  
3. Customize paths and data fields to match your CRM system.  
4. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it processes and logs correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test webhook to simulate patient data submission. Run the workflow to see how data is processed and logged in Google Sheets. Modify a data field to trigger an error and verify if Slack alerts you.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer efficient patient data management solutions, enhancing your service offerings in the healthcare sector. This can attract more clients and increase your revenue in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
