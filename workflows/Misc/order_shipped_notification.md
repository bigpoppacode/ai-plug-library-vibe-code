# Order Shipped Notification
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Order Shipped Notification", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/order-shipped-notification`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "order_shipped_notification"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "order_shipped_notification"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Order Shipped Notification':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow listens for an "Order Shipped" notification via a webhook. It processes incoming data, stores it in a Supabase database, and uses AI to generate a status report. The result is documented in a Google Sheet, and any errors trigger a Slack alert, ensuring smooth order processing and error management.

**Demonstrate:**  
A logistics company could use this workflow to automatically update their database and notify their team when an order is shipped, ensuring accurate tracking and minimizing manual data entry.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Supabase, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.
3. Set up a POST webhook to receive order data.
4. Map the data flow through the nodes.
5. Test with sample data to ensure proper functionality.

**Practice:**  
Create a test webhook and send sample order data to see how it is processed. Check if the data is correctly stored in Supabase and logged in Google Sheets. Simulate an error to test the Slack alert functionality.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can streamline order management, reduce errors, and enhance customer satisfaction. Offering such automation solutions can attract clients, boost your service portfolio, and increase revenue in your AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
