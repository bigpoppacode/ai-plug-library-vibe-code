# Zoom Attendance Log
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Zoom Attendance Log", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/zoom-attendance-log`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "zoom_attendance_log"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "zoom_attendance_log"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Zoom Attendance Log':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This workflow automates the process of logging Zoom meeting attendance. It begins with a Webhook Trigger that listens for POST requests containing attendance data. The data is processed and split into manageable chunks using a Text Splitter. These chunks are then converted into vector embeddings, which are inserted into a Supabase database. The data is also queried and processed by an AI model to generate insights or summaries, which are then appended to a Google Sheet. In case of errors, alerts are sent to a specified Slack channel.

**Demonstrate**  
A business could use this workflow to automatically log and analyze attendance data from Zoom meetings, ensuring accurate and timely record-keeping. This is useful for training sessions, webinars, or any scenario where tracking participation is critical.

**Imitate**  
1. Set up a Webhook in n8n and connect it to your Zoom to receive attendance data.
2. Configure Supabase to store and query this data.
3. Set up the AI model to process and generate insights.
4. Connect Google Sheets to log these insights.
5. Set up Slack alerts for error notifications.

**Practice**  
Create a mock Zoom meeting attendance log using a simple JSON payload. Run the workflow to see how data is processed, logged, and queried. Adjust the AI model's parameters to see different insights being generated.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data logging and analysis services. It can help clients maintain accurate records effortlessly, making your automation services invaluable for businesses that rely on detailed meeting analytics.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
