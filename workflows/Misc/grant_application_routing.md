# Grant Application Routing
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Grant Application Routing", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/grant-application-routing`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "grant_application_routing"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "grant_application_routing"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Grant Application Routing':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of routing grant applications. It starts by receiving application data through a webhook. The data is split and embedded using OpenAI's embeddings model, then stored in a Supabase vector database. A query retrieves relevant information, and a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent processes the data to determine the application status. Results are logged in a Google Sheet, and errors trigger alerts in Slack.

### Demonstrate
A nonprofit organization could use this workflow to automate the processing of grant applications, ensuring each application is efficiently routed and logged, reducing manual workload and minimizing errors in data handling.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Supabase, OpenAI, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.
3. Set up the webhook to receive grant application data.
4. Customize data processing and logging as needed.
5. Test the workflow to ensure proper routing and logging.

### Practice
Create a test grant application form and simulate submissions to see how the workflow processes and logs the data. Adjust the settings to handle different types of applications and test error handling with incorrect data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide automated data processing services for organizations, improving their efficiency and accuracy in handling applications. This skill can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
