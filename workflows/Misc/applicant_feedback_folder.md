# Applicant Feedback Folder
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Applicant Feedback Folder", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/applicant-feedback-folder`
4. **Pinecone Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
5. **Pinecone Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — pineconeIndex: "[object Object]"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Applicant Feedback Folder':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of managing applicant feedback by integrating various tools. It starts with a Webhook that triggers when new feedback is received. The feedback data is split into manageable chunks and converted into embeddings using OpenAI's model. These are then stored in Pinecone, a vector database. The workflow queries Pinecone to retrieve relevant information, which is processed by an AI agent to generate insights or actions. The results are appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping, and any errors trigger a Slack alert for immediate attention.

**Demonstrate**  
A recruitment agency could use this workflow to efficiently process and analyze feedback from job applicants, ensuring that valuable insights are captured and stored for future reference, improving their recruitment strategy and candidate experience.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up your Webhook to capture feedback data.  
3. Configure OpenAI and Pinecone API credentials.  
4. Customize the Google Sheet to log processed feedback.  
5. Test the workflow by sending sample data through the Webhook.

**Practice**  
Create a test scenario by simulating feedback entries using a simple form that triggers the Webhook. Verify that the data is correctly processed, stored in Pinecone, and logged in the Google Sheet. Adjust configurations to handle different feedback types.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow equips you to offer automated feedback management solutions, enhancing data-driven decision-making capabilities for clients. This can expand your service offerings, attract new customers, and increase revenue by providing high-value automation solutions in the recruitment and HR sectors.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
