# Interview Scheduler
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Interview Scheduler", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/interview-scheduler`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "interview_scheduler"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "interview_scheduler"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Interview Scheduler':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This n8n workflow automates the scheduling and processing of interview data. It starts with a webhook trigger that receives interview requests, processes the data with AI and vector databases through Weaviate, and uses a Chat Model to assist with decision-making. The results are stored in a Google Sheet, and any errors trigger a Slack alert.

- **Demonstrate**: A recruitment firm could use this workflow to streamline interview scheduling, ensuring each request is processed efficiently and logged, minimizing manual handling and errors.

- **Imitate**: Import the workflow into n8n, connect your Weaviate and Google Sheets accounts, set up a POST webhook with your interview form, and customize the Google Sheet to store relevant data. Test by sending a sample request to ensure it logs correctly.

- **Practice**: Create a test webhook with mock interview data, run the workflow, and verify the data is processed and logged accurately. Adjust the Chat Model prompt to refine the decision-making process.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow equips you to offer automated interview scheduling services, enhancing efficiency for clients and expanding your AI automation business, potentially increasing revenue through new service offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
