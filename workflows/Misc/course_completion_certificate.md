# Course Completion Certificate
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Course Completion Certificate", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/course-completion-certificate`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "course_completion_certificate"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "course_completion_certificate"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Course Completion Certificate':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:** This n8n workflow automates the generation of course completion certificates. It starts when data is sent to a webhook, which is then processed and stored in Supabase. The data is split into chunks, embedded for context, and queried for relevant information. An AI model processes the information to finalize the certificate data. The results are logged in Google Sheets, and any errors trigger a Slack alert.

**Demonstrate:** A training company could use this workflow to automatically generate certificates for students who complete courses. This ensures timely and accurate certificate distribution, enhancing the student experience.

**Imitate:** 
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Supabase, OpenAI, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts.
3. Set up the webhook with your course completion data.
4. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure certificates are generated correctly.

**Practice:** Create a test course in your system and simulate a completion event to trigger the workflow. Check the Google Sheet for the certificate data and ensure the Slack channel is alerted for any errors.

**WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated certification services, appealing to educational institutions and online course providers. This can increase your service offerings and potentially boost your income in the automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
