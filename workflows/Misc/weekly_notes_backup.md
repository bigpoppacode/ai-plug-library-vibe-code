# Weekly Notes Backup
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Automated workflow: Weekly Notes Backup", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/weekly-notes-backup`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "weekly_notes_backup"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "weekly_notes_backup"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Process the following data for task 'Weekly Notes Backup':

{{ $json }}", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `embed-english-v3.0`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of backing up weekly notes. It starts when data is sent to a specific URL (Webhook Trigger). The notes are then split into manageable chunks and converted into vector embeddings using a Cohere model. These vectors are stored in a Weaviate database for easy retrieval. The workflow also processes the data using an AI agent to provide context and logs the results in a Google Sheet. If errors occur, alerts are sent to a designated Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A consultant could use this workflow to automate the backup and retrieval of weekly meeting notes for a client. It ensures that all notes are stored efficiently and can be easily accessed and analyzed later, improving documentation and decision-making processes.

### Imitate
1. Set up the Webhook Trigger in n8n.
2. Connect Cohere and Weaviate accounts for embeddings and storage.
3. Configure Google Sheets to log backup status.
4. Set up Slack for error notifications.
5. Test with sample data to ensure proper functionality.

### Practice
Create a small dataset of weekly notes and run the workflow. Observe how the notes are split, converted, stored, and logged. Modify the notes' content to see how changes are processed and ensure error notifications work by simulating failures.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer clients reliable data backup and retrieval services, enhancing their operational efficiency. It positions you as a capable automation expert, potentially increasing your client base and income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
