# Wordpress Filter Update Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "662.5970350404314", height: "321.75"
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "323", content: "[redacted]"
5. **Get content to post** `airtable` — operation: **search**, table: `[object Object]`
6. **Filter by existing Blogs** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
8. **Markdown to HTML** `markdown` — mode: "markdownToHtml", options: "[object Object]", markdown: "={{ $json['Blog Body'] }} {{ $json['Blog Body'] }} {{ $json['Blog Body'] }}"
9. **Post on Wordpress** `wordpress` — title: "={{ $json.Title }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
10. **Get Image** `httpRequest` — url: `=https://api.pexels.com/v1/search?query= {{ $('Edit Fields').item.json.Keyword }}&per_page=1&width=1200&height=675&format=webp`
11. **Download the image** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.photos[0].src.landscape }}`
12. **Upload Media** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://effibotics.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media`
13. **Set Featured Image** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `={{ $('Settings').item.json.wordpress_url }}wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{{ $('Post on Wordpress').item.json.id }}`
14. **Update POST on Airtable** `airtable` — operation: **update**, table: `[object Object]`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This workflow automates the process of posting blogs from Airtable to WordPress. It retrieves blog content from Airtable, converts markdown to HTML, and posts it on WordPress. It also fetches an image from Pexels based on a keyword, uploads it to WordPress, and sets it as the featured image. Finally, it updates the Airtable record to mark the post as published.

### Demonstrate
A content manager could use this workflow to streamline the process of publishing blog posts. By automating the posting process, they save time and ensure that their WordPress site is consistently updated with new content from their Airtable database.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Airtable and WordPress accounts.
3. Set up a schedule to trigger the workflow.
4. Customize the Airtable search to match your content criteria.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it posts correctly to WordPress.

### Practice
Create a test Airtable with dummy blog posts and run the workflow. Observe how it converts markdown to HTML, posts to WordPress, and updates the Airtable status. Modify a post title or content to see how changes are handled.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated content management services, reducing manual labor and improving efficiency for clients who maintain blogs. This can expand your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase revenue in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
