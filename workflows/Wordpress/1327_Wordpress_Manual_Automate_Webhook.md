# Wordpress Manual Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "800", height: "380"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "260", content: "Connect with your Google Sheet. This node select only rows for which no content has been generated yet in WordPress"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "420", height: "260", content: "Add your DeepSeek API credential. If you want you can change the model with "deepseek-chat""
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "160", height: "260", content: "Add your WordPress API credential
"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "160", height: "260", content: "Add your OpenAI API credential
"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "180", height: "260", content: "Upload the image on your WordPress via APIs
"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — width: "180", height: "260", content: "Set the uploaded image with the newly created article
"
10. **Get Ideas** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
11. **Set your prompt** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Generate article with DeepSeek** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
13. **Generate title with DeepSeek** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
14. **Create post on Wordpress** `wordpress` — title: "={{ $json.message.content }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
15. **Generate Image with DALL-E** `openAi` — resource: **image**, prompt: "=Generate a real photographic image used as a cover for a blog post:

Image prompt:
{{ $('Generate title with DeepSeek').item.json.message.content }}, photography, realistic, sigma…[truncated]"
16. **Upload image** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://YOURSITE.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media`
17. **Set Image** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://wp.test.7hype.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{{ $('Create post on Wordpress').item.json.id }}`
18. **Update Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **update**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates content generation for a WordPress blog using Google Sheets, DeepSeek, and OpenAI. It starts by retrieving prompts from a Google Sheet, generates an article and a title using DeepSeek, creates a draft post in WordPress, generates a cover image with DALL-E, uploads it to WordPress, and updates the Google Sheet with post details.

### Demonstrate
A content manager could use this workflow to automate the creation and publishing of blog posts. By using AI to generate articles and images, they can maintain a consistent posting schedule without manual content creation, saving time and ensuring SEO-friendly content.

### Imitate
1. Import workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Google Sheets with prompts.
3. Add API credentials for DeepSeek, OpenAI, and WordPress.
4. Test workflow with sample data.
5. Adjust prompts and nodes as needed for your content strategy.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with a few prompts. Run the workflow and observe how it generates and uploads content to WordPress. Experiment with different prompts to see the variations in output.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer automated content creation services, enhancing your portfolio and attracting clients seeking efficient content strategies. This can lead to increased revenue and opportunities in the AI automation sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, wordpressApi, wooCommerceApi, openAiApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
