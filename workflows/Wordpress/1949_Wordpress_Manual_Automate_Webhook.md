# Wordpress Manual Automate Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "800", height: "380"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — height: "260", content: "Connect with your Google Sheet. This node select only rows for which no content has been generated yet in WordPress"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "420", height: "260", content: "Add your DeepSeek API credential. If you want you can change the model with "deepseek-chat""
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "160", height: "260", content: "Add your WordPress API credential
"
7. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — width: "160", height: "260", content: "Add your OpenAI API credential
"
8. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "180", height: "260", content: "Upload the image on your WordPress via APIs
"
9. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — width: "180", height: "260", content: "Set the uploaded image with the newly created article
"
10. **Get Ideas** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
11. **Set your prompt** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **Generate article with DeepSeek** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
13. **Generate title with DeepSeek** `openAi` — modelId: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]", messages: "[object Object]"
14. **Create post on Wordpress** `wordpress` — title: "={{ $json.message.content }}", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
15. **Generate Image with DALL-E** `openAi` — resource: **image**, prompt: "=Generate a real photographic image used as a cover for a blog post:

Image prompt:
{{ $('Generate title with DeepSeek').item.json.message.content }}, photography, realistic, sigma…[truncated]"
16. **Upload image** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://YOURSITE.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media`
17. **Set Image** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://wp.test.7hype.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/{{ $('Create post on Wordpress').item.json.id }}`
18. **Update Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **update**

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of SEO-friendly blog posts for WordPress. It starts by retrieving topic ideas from a Google Sheet. Using DeepSeek, it generates an article and a title based on these ideas. An image is then created with DALL-E and uploaded to WordPress. The workflow concludes by updating the Google Sheet with the post details, ensuring a streamlined content creation process.

### Demonstrate
A content manager could use this workflow to automate blog post creation, saving time and ensuring consistent, quality content output. This is especially useful for maintaining a regular posting schedule with minimal manual input.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets, WordPress, DeepSeek, and OpenAI accounts.
3. Set up a Google Sheet with columns for Date, Prompt, Title, and Post ID.
4. Run the workflow to test the content generation and posting process.
5. Adjust the prompts and models as needed.

### Practice
Create a new Google Sheet with sample prompts and run the workflow. Observe how articles are generated and posted. Modify prompts to see the impact on the generated content and images.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated content creation services to clients. This can enhance their digital marketing efforts, improve SEO, and increase engagement, providing a valuable service that can lead to recurring revenue streams.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, wordpressApi, wooCommerceApi, openAiApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
