# Linkedin Code Automation Webhook
  ## üöÄ What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## üíº Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "4", height: "141.4092845296238", content: "## Start the flow every day at the same time"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", width: "367.12018536439575", height: "382.294335406698"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "6", width: "627.4768047417825", height: "380.3367219655605"
5. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` ‚Äî rule: "[object Object]"
6. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` ‚Äî color: "3", width: "567.6073693795047", height: "137.6834217043934"
7. **Filter the table for the day's post** `notion` ‚Äî resource: **databasePage**, operation: **getAll**
8. **Fetch the content on the page** `notion` ‚Äî resource: **block**, operation: **getAll**
9. **Aggregate the Notion blocks** `aggregate` ‚Äî options: "[object Object]", fieldsToAggregate: "[object Object]"
10. **Format the post** `code` ‚Äî jsCode: "const notionData = items[0].json.content;

let formattedText = notionData[0] 

for (let i = 1; i < notionData.length; i++) {
    if (notionData[i].startsWith('-')) {
        format‚Ä¶[truncated]"
11. **Download image** `httpRequest` ‚Äî url: `={{ $json.url[0] }}`
12. **Merge** `merge` ‚Äî mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "mergeByPosition"
13. **Publish on LinkedIn** `linkedIn` ‚Äî text: "={{ $json.formattedText }}", person: "CcS-_lLyzG", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
14. **Update post status in notion database** `notion` ‚Äî resource: **databasePage**, operation: **update**
  
  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of posting content from a Notion database to LinkedIn. It starts with a scheduled trigger that runs daily. The workflow filters the Notion database to find the day's post, retrieves and aggregates the content, formats it, downloads any associated images, and merges the data. Finally, it publishes the post on LinkedIn and updates the post's status in Notion to "Published."

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to maintain a consistent social media presence by automatically posting daily updates or blog entries from their Notion workspace to LinkedIn, saving time on manual posting.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Connect your Notion and LinkedIn accounts.  
3. Set up the Notion database with your content.  
4. Configure the schedule trigger for your desired posting time.  
5. Customize the LinkedIn post format if needed.  
6. Activate the workflow.

**Practice**  
Create a sample Notion database with a few entries including text and images. Run the workflow manually to test if it correctly formats and posts the content to LinkedIn, and updates the status in Notion.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate content distribution, enhancing your productivity and consistency on LinkedIn. This can attract more clients and increase engagement, potentially boosting your business's visibility and revenue.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, linkedInOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
