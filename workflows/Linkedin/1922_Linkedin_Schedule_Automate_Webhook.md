# Linkedin Schedule Automate Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "652.1201853643956", height: "542.0867486896091"
4. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "860.9829802912225", height: "540.7357881640437", content: "## Format Post
Send the post to OpenAI, where it will attempt to ask your assistant how to take the incoming blob of text, and soup it up into something more palpable for LinkedIn …[truncated]"
5. **query entries from Notion table for today** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**, operation: **getAll**
6. **get all content from post page** `notion` — resource: **block**, operation: **getAll**
7. **Pull together all text blocks + image** `aggregate` — options: "[object Object]", fieldsToAggregate: "[object Object]"
8. **Fetch image from post** `httpRequest` — url: `={{ $json.url[0] }}`
9. **Reformat Post Text** `openAi` — resource: **assistant**, prompt: "define"
10. **Combine text+image** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "mergeByPosition"
11. **Post on LinkedIn** `linkedIn` — text: "={{ $json.output }}", person: "_RmSSZc0jB", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
12. **Set post status to "Done"** `notion` — resource: **databasePage**, operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates LinkedIn posting by scheduling daily posts from a Notion database. It retrieves the day's content, reformats it using OpenAI for better engagement, combines it with an image, and posts it on LinkedIn. The post's status is then updated to "Done" in Notion.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to ensure consistent and engaging LinkedIn presence without manual posting, saving time and maintaining a professional online presence, which is crucial for networking and brand building.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your Notion and LinkedIn accounts.
3. Set up your Notion table with the required columns (Name, Status, Date).
4. Customize the OpenAI prompt to fit your brand's voice.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it posts correctly.

### Practice
Create a Notion database with sample posts and run the workflow to see how it formats and posts content to LinkedIn. Adjust the OpenAI prompt and Notion database as needed to better suit your style and needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated social media management services, helping businesses maintain a consistent online presence, engage their audience effectively, and save time, potentially increasing your revenue as a consultant or business owner.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** notionApi, linkedInOAuth2Api, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
