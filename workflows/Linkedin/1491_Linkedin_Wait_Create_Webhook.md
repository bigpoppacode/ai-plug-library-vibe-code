  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Calls external APIs and uses **AI** to transform or decide, then routes the result downstream.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of converting Hacker News articles into engaging videos. It fetches articles from Hacker News, uses OpenAI to analyze the content, and generates structured summaries. The workflow then creates related images using AI tools and compiles these into videos. The videos are uploaded to platforms like YouTube, and the workflow can further distribute content across social media and cloud storage, ensuring wider reach and engagement.

### Demonstrate
A tech news website could use this workflow to automatically generate video content from trending articles, enhancing their multimedia offerings and engaging a broader audience. This saves time on manual content creation and helps keep their platform updated with the latest news.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up Hacker News API access.
3. Configure OpenAI and image generation APIs.
4. Define the video creation and upload settings.
5. Test the workflow with sample articles to ensure it successfully creates and uploads videos.

### Practice
Create a test workflow using a different news source, like a blog RSS feed. Adapt the workflow to analyze and summarize blog posts, create images, and compile them into videos. Test the workflow to ensure it functions correctly.

### WIIFM
Learning this workflow equips you with skills to automate content creation, a valuable service for digital media companies. Mastering it can help you offer innovative automation solutions, attract clients, and generate income by transforming text content into engaging video formats.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, googleDriveOAuth2Api, httpCustomAuth.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
