  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using stravaTrigger, beeminder.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Beeminder**.
  2. **Beeminder** `beeminder` — goalName: "testing", additionalFields: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automatically adds a datapoint to Beeminder whenever a new activity is recorded in Strava. Strava is a platform for tracking physical activities, and Beeminder helps track goals. This workflow connects the two, updating Beeminder with new activity details from Strava to keep track of progress towards fitness goals.

### Demonstrate
A fitness coach could use this workflow to help clients track their exercise goals. By automatically logging activities from Strava to Beeminder, clients can visualize their progress and stay motivated, ensuring they meet their fitness targets.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Strava and Beeminder accounts.
3. Set up a Strava Trigger for new activities.
4. Configure the Beeminder node with your goal and additional fields.
5. Test the workflow by logging a new activity in Strava.

### Practice
Create a test Strava account and a simple Beeminder goal. Log a few test activities in Strava and observe how they are automatically added as datapoints in Beeminder. Adjust the workflow to customize the comments or data logged.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer seamless fitness tracking solutions to clients, enhancing their goal-tracking capabilities. This can increase client satisfaction and retention, opening doors for upselling more comprehensive automation services in the fitness industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
