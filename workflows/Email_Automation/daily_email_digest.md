# Daily Email Digest
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Daily Email Digest", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/daily-email-digest`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "daily_email_digest"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "daily_email_digest"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of a daily email digest. It starts with a webhook trigger that receives data, which is then split into smaller parts for processing. The workflow uses OpenAI embeddings to transform the text into a vector format, which is stored and queried in a Supabase vector database. An AI agent processes the data, generating insights or summaries. Results are appended to a Google Sheet for record-keeping. In case of errors, a notification is sent to a Slack channel.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to compile daily updates from various sources into a single email digest, improving team communication and ensuring everyone is on the same page without manual compilation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Supabase, OpenAI, Slack, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up a POST webhook to receive daily data.
4. Customize the text processing and AI prompts to fit your needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure data is correctly processed and recorded.

### Practice
Create a test webhook to send sample data. Observe how the workflow processes the data, generates summaries, and appends them to a Google Sheet. Modify the AI prompts and text processing to see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer clients automated daily insights, which can enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. This skill can boost your service offerings in an AI automation business, attracting more clients and increasing revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
