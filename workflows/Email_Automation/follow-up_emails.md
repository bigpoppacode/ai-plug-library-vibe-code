# Follow Up Emails
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Follow-up Emails", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/follow-up-emails`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "follow-up_emails"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "follow-up_emails"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This workflow automates the process of handling follow-up emails. It starts by triggering when a POST request is received. The data is split into manageable chunks, embedded into a vector format using OpenAI's API, and stored in a Weaviate database. This setup allows for efficient querying and retrieval of email content. The workflow also uses an AI model to process and handle the data, logs the status in a Google Sheet, and sends alerts via Slack if errors occur.

- **Demonstrate**: A sales team could use this workflow to streamline follow-up emails, ensuring no lead is missed and all communication is logged and accessible for future reference.

- **Imitate**: Import the workflow into n8n. Connect your OpenAI, Weaviate, Google Sheets, and Slack accounts. Customize the Webhook path and Google Sheet details. Test the workflow by sending a POST request with sample email data to ensure it processes and logs correctly.

- **Practice**: Set up a test environment by creating a test Google Sheet and Slack channel. Send a POST request with mock email data to see how the workflow processes it and logs the results. Modify the email content to observe changes in processing and logging.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer efficient email management services to clients, enhancing their communication strategies. This can lead to increased client satisfaction, retention, and the potential for upselling automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
