# Product Launch Email
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Product Launch Email", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/product-launch-email`
4. **Supabase Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "product_launch_email"
5. **Supabase Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "product_launch_email"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `embed-english-v3.0`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of handling product launch emails. It begins by receiving data through a webhook, processes and splits the text into manageable chunks, and then uses AI to generate embeddings. These embeddings are stored in Supabase for later retrieval. The workflow can query these embeddings for relevant data, which is then used by an AI model to provide context-aware responses or actions. Finally, any errors are logged, and alerts are sent via Slack, ensuring smooth operation and immediate notification of issues.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to streamline the management of product launch communications, ensuring that all relevant data is stored and easily retrievable for future marketing campaigns or customer inquiries.

- **Imitate:** To adapt this workflow, start by setting up a webhook in n8n to capture incoming data. Connect a text splitter to break the content into chunks, then use an embeddings model to process these chunks. Store the results in a database like Supabase. Set up alerts in Slack for monitoring.

- **Practice:** Create a test scenario by simulating a product launch email. Use the workflow to process and store this data, then query the stored data to retrieve specific information. Monitor the alerts in Slack for any errors.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to efficiently manage large volumes of data from product launches or marketing campaigns. This skill can help you offer data management and AI-enhanced communication services to clients, enhancing your business's value and expanding your service offerings.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
