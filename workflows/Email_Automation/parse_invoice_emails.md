# Parse Invoice Emails
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — content: "Placeholder for Parse Invoice Emails", height: "530", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook Trigger** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/parse-invoice-emails`
4. **Weaviate Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", options: "[object Object]", indexName: "parse_invoice_emails"
5. **Weaviate Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "parse_invoice_emails"
6. **Vector Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate", description: "Vector context"
7. **Chat Model** `lmChatAnthropic` — options: "[object Object]"
8. **RAG Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "Handle data", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Slack Alert** `slack` — channel/topic: `#alerts`
10. **Text Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
11. **Window Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
12. **Append Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
13. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `text-embedding-3-small`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**: This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of parsing invoice emails. It begins with a Webhook Trigger that listens for incoming POST requests containing email data. The Text Splitter breaks down the email content into manageable chunks. These chunks are then converted into embeddings using OpenAI's model and stored in the Weaviate vector database. The workflow can query this database to retrieve relevant data and use a Chat Model to handle and process the data, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent. Results are appended to a Google Sheet, and any errors trigger a Slack alert for immediate attention.

**Demonstrate**: A business owner could use this workflow to automate the processing of invoice emails, ensuring data is accurately extracted and stored for financial records, reducing manual entry errors, and saving time.

**Imitate**: 
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook Trigger to receive email data.
3. Configure Text Splitter, Embeddings, and Weaviate nodes with your credentials.
4. Connect a Google Sheet to log processed data.
5. Test the workflow by sending a sample email data POST request.

**Practice**: Create a test email with invoice details and send it as a POST request to the webhook. Check if the data is processed, stored in the vector database, and logged in the Google Sheet. Adjust the workflow based on the results.

**WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated email parsing services, enhancing business operations by reducing manual data entry. This skill can attract clients needing efficient data handling solutions, potentially increasing your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api, slackApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
