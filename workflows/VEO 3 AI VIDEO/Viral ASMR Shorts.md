## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation and posting of ASMR-style videos of glass objects. It generates video prompts based on specified objects, retrieves the generated video, and uploads it to YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, while managing data in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner running a social media account can use this workflow to consistently produce unique ASMR video content featuring glass objects, thereby attracting followers and increasing engagement without manual video creation.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your API credentials for video generation and social media platforms.
3. Customize the object list in Google Sheets.
4. Adjust the video prompt details in the AI nodes.
5. Test the workflow to ensure videos generate and upload correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the object list in Google Sheets by adding new glass items. Run the workflow and observe how it generates videos for the new items and posts them to social media.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you create engaging content at scale, allowing you to attract a larger audience for your business or client, ultimately increasing revenue through enhanced visibility and engagement on social media platforms.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Generate Video" and "Sticky Note3" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
