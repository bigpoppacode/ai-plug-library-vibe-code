## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation and posting of AI-generated video content across multiple platforms (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) based on a schedule. It generates video prompts from predefined elements, composes videos, and updates their statuses in a Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically generate and publish engaging video content for social media, saving time and enhancing brand visibility. For example, a cooking channel could post daily ASMR cooking videos without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** for when to run the workflow.
3. Configure the **OpenRouter Chat Model** to generate video prompts.
4. Use the **AI Agent** steps to create video clips and combine them.
5. Set up **HTTP Requests** to post the videos to YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.
6. Log video details in Google Sheets for tracking.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to use different elements or themes for video generation. For instance, change the objects and materials used, or adjust the posting schedule to see how it affects the output and engagement on social media.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide high-value automation services, helping clients save time and enhance their online presence. This can lead to increased customer retention and new revenue opportunities as businesses seek efficient content strategies.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Schedule Trigger" and "Sticky Note2" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
