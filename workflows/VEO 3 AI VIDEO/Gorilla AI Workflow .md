## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of generating creative video ideas using AI. It collects input from a scheduled trigger, generates ideas based on user prompts, and saves the ideas in Google Sheets. Finally, it creates a video from these ideas, retrieves it, and updates the Google Sheet with the final output.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate content creation for their social media. By generating engaging video ideas regularly, they can save time and enhance their marketing strategy, ensuring consistent content that resonates with their audience.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Schedule Trigger to run daily.
3. Integrate an AI model node to generate content ideas.
4. Use Google Sheets to save the generated ideas.
5. Set up an HTTP Request node to create and retrieve videos from an external service.
6. Update the Google Sheet with final video links.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to generate ideas based on different prompts or themes. Experiment with altering the frequency of the scheduled trigger to see how it impacts your content generation process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate creative processes, enhancing efficiency and output quality. It can help you attract clients in need of content generation, positioning your services as essential in the AI automation landscape.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note12" and "💭 Think" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
