# Game Bug Triage
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Game Bug Triage", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/game_bug_triage`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "game_bug_triage"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "game_bug_triage"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the triage process for game bugs. It starts by capturing bug reports via a webhook. The reports are split into manageable chunks and converted into embeddings using a language model. These embeddings are stored in a Redis vector store for efficient querying. The workflow uses AI to categorize and analyze the bug data, then records the results in a Google Sheet for tracking and further action.

### Demonstrate
A game development company might use this workflow to streamline their bug handling process, ensuring that all reported issues are logged, analyzed, and prioritized quickly. This helps in maintaining game quality and improving user satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to capture bug reports.
3. Connect Redis and Google Sheets.
4. Customize the AI model and parameters based on specific bug triage needs.
5. Test the workflow to ensure proper data handling and logging.

### Practice
Create a sample bug report and submit it through the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the report, generates embeddings, and logs the results in Google Sheets. Adjust the AI parameters to see how it affects triage outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can enhance your ability to offer automated bug triage solutions to game developers, improving their operational efficiency. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and open up new revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, redisApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
