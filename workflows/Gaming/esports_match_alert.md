# Esports Match Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Esports Match Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/esports_match_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "esports_match_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "esports_match_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling esports match alerts. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, processes the data by splitting and embedding it, and stores it in a vector database named Weaviate. The workflow then queries the database, uses AI to generate insights, and logs the results in a Google Sheet. This setup ensures efficient management of esports match data and provides actionable insights.

### Demonstrate
A gaming company could use this workflow to automatically track esports matches, analyze player performance, and store insights for strategic decisions. This can help in real-time decision-making and improving player engagement strategies.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive match data.
3. Connect Weaviate and configure the vector database.
4. Use AI to process and generate insights from the data.
5. Link a Google Sheet to log the results.
6. Test with sample data to ensure accuracy.

### Practice
Create a test webhook to simulate receiving match data. Run the workflow and verify that the data is processed correctly, stored in Weaviate, and that insights are logged in the Google Sheet. Adjust parameters to see different outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer data-driven insights services to esports companies, enhancing their strategic decision-making. This can increase your marketability as an automation consultant, allowing you to secure clients and generate income through advanced AI-driven solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
