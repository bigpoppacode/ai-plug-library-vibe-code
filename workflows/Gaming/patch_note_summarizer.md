# Patch Note Summarizer
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Patch Note Summarizer", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/patch_note_summarizer`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "patch_note_summarizer"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "patch_note_summarizer"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the summarization of patch notes. It begins with a webhook that receives patch notes, which are then split into chunks. These chunks are converted into embeddings and stored in a vector database called Weaviate. The workflow queries this database to find relevant information, which is processed by an AI agent to generate a summary. The summary is then logged in a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A software company can use this workflow to automatically summarize patch notes. This is useful for developers and customers who need concise updates without reading lengthy documentation. It improves efficiency in understanding software changes.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the webhook to receive data.
3. Connect to Weaviate and Google Sheets.
4. Customize text splitting and embedding parameters.
5. Test with sample patch notes to ensure correct summarization and logging.

### Practice
Create a sample patch note document and run it through the workflow. Check the Google Sheet to see if the summary is accurate and concise. Experiment by changing the chunk size and overlap to see how it affects the summary.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated documentation services, saving time for clients by providing quick and accurate summaries of technical updates. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and retention, making your automation business more profitable.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
