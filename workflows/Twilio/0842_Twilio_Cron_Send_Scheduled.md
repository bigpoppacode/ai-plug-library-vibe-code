# Twilio Cron Send Scheduled
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Postgres1**.
2. **Postgres1** `postgres` — operation: **update**, table: `n8n`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow monitors a Postgres database for sensor readings greater than 70 that haven't triggered a notification. It runs on a schedule, sends an alert via Twilio when conditions are met, and updates the database to mark the notification as sent. This ensures timely alerts for critical sensor values.

### Demonstrate
A manufacturing facility could use this workflow to monitor equipment sensors. If a temperature sensor exceeds safe limits, the workflow sends an SMS alert to the maintenance team, preventing equipment damage and downtime.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Postgres and Twilio accounts.
3. Set up the Cron node to run on your desired schedule.
4. Customize the SQL query and Twilio message with your sensor details.
5. Test the workflow to ensure alerts are sent and the database is updated.

### Practice
Create a test database with a table for sensor data. Insert values above and below the threshold. Run the workflow to see how it handles different readings and updates the notification status correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer real-time monitoring and alerting solutions to clients, enhancing their operational efficiency and safety. This capability can help you attract clients in industries like manufacturing, logistics, or energy, boosting your automation business's value.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres, twilioApi.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
