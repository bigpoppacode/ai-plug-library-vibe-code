### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of sending new leads from a Typeform form to a specified WhatsApp number using Twilio. When a user submits a Typeform, the workflow captures their responses, formats the data, and sends it as a WhatsApp message to notify someone about the new lead. This ensures timely follow-up and efficient lead management.

2. Connect your Typeform and Twilio accounts.
3. Set up the Typeform Trigger with your form ID.
4. Configure the Twilio node with your phone numbers.
5. Test the workflow to ensure new leads appear on WhatsApp.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform with fields like name and email. Run the workflow by submitting the form, and see how the data appears on WhatsApp. Adjust the message formatting in the Set node and observe the changes.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
