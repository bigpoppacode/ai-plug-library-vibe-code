# Carbon Footprint Estimator
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Carbon Footprint Estimator", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/carbon_footprint_estimator`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "carbon_footprint_estimator"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "carbon_footprint_estimator"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the estimation of carbon footprints by processing incoming data through a series of nodes. It starts with a webhook that receives data, splits the data into manageable chunks, and uses OpenAI's embedding model to create vector representations. These vectors are stored and queried in a Pinecone vector database. An AI agent processes the data, and results are appended to a Google Sheet, providing a structured output for further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to provide customers with insights into their carbon footprints based on their activity data. This can enhance service offerings for companies focused on sustainability and environmental impact.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect OpenAI, Pinecone, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up a webhook to receive data.
4. Customize the Google Sheet to log specific information.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it processes and logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a test dataset with various activities and their carbon impact. Run the workflow to see how it processes the data and logs the results in Google Sheets. Adjust parameters to see different outcomes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer carbon footprint estimation services, appealing to eco-conscious clients. This can expand your service offerings, attract new customers, and increase revenue in the growing sustainability market.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, pineconeApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
