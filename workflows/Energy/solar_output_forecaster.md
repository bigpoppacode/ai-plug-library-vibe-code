  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Solar Output Forecaster", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/solar_output_forecaster`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "solar_output_forecaster"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "solar_output_forecaster"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow named "Solar Output Forecaster" processes incoming data through a series of nodes to forecast solar energy output. It begins with a webhook that receives data and splits it into manageable chunks. These chunks are turned into embeddings (numeric representations) using Hugging Face, which are then stored in a Supabase vector database. The system queries these embeddings to forecast solar output and logs results in Google Sheets for tracking and analysis.

**Demonstrate**  
A solar panel company might use this workflow to predict energy output based on weather data. This helps optimize energy distribution and maintenance schedules, improving efficiency and reducing operational costs.

**Imitate**  
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive data.
2. Use a Text Splitter to process incoming data.
3. Convert data to embeddings using Hugging Face.
4. Store and query data in Supabase.
5. Log results in Google Sheets.

**Practice**  
Create a test webhook to send sample solar data. Observe how the workflow processes, stores, and predicts output. Adjust the inputs to see changes in predictions and log the results.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow equips you to offer predictive analytics solutions to energy companies, enhancing their efficiency. This can expand your service offerings, attract new clients, and increase your income in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
