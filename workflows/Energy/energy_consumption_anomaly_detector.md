# Energy Consumption Anomaly Detector
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Energy Consumption Anomaly Detector", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/energy_consumption_anomaly_detector`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "energy_consumption_anomaly_detector"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "energy_consumption_anomaly_detector"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**   
The "Energy Consumption Anomaly Detector" workflow in n8n automates the detection of unusual energy consumption patterns. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, which is then split and transformed into embeddings using a text splitter and Hugging Face model. These embeddings are stored and queried in a Supabase vector store. The workflow uses AI to identify anomalies and logs results in Google Sheets.

**Demonstrate:**  
A utility company could use this workflow to monitor customer energy data, detect anomalies, and quickly identify unusual consumption patterns, allowing for timely intervention and customer notifications.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the webhook to receive energy data.  
3. Connect Supabase and Google Sheets accounts.  
4. Customize the index name and fields to match your data.  
5. Test with sample data to ensure correct anomaly detection and logging.

**Practice:**  
Create a test dataset with normal and abnormal energy consumption values. Run the workflow and check if it correctly identifies anomalies and logs them in Google Sheets.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer anomaly detection services to clients, helping them optimize energy usage and reduce costs. This skill can enhance your service portfolio, attract new clients, and increase your income in the automation industry.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, supabaseApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
