# Ev Charging Station Locator
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## EV Charging Station Locator", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/ev_charging_station_locator`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "ev_charging_station_locator"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "ev_charging_station_locator"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to locate EV charging stations. It starts with a webhook that receives data about EV charging stations. The data is then processed and split into manageable chunks. These chunks are converted into embeddings using a model from Hugging Face and stored in a Supabase vector database. The workflow can also query this database to retrieve relevant data. A chat model from Anthropic is used to handle interactions, and the results are logged in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to provide a real-time service for drivers looking for nearby EV charging stations, enhancing customer experience and engagement.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook in n8n to receive EV charging station data.
2. Configure the Splitter node to divide the data.
3. Use the Embeddings node to convert data into vectors.
4. Store vectors in Supabase and set up a query system.
5. Log outputs in Google Sheets for record-keeping.

### Practice
Create a small dataset of EV charging stations and test the workflow by submitting data through the webhook. Verify that the data is processed, stored, and retrieved accurately, and check the Google Sheets log for completeness.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer a valuable service in the growing EV market, attracting customers looking for charging solutions. It can open opportunities for partnerships with EV infrastructure companies and generate new revenue streams in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
