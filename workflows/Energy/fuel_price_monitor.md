# Fuel Price Monitor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Fuel Price Monitor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/fuel_price_monitor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "fuel_price_monitor"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "fuel_price_monitor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to monitor and analyze fuel prices. It receives data via a webhook, processes the data through several steps including embedding creation and text splitting, and stores the processed information in a vector database (Weaviate). The workflow also uses memory and chat components to handle and respond to queries about the fuel price data, and logs the results into a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A fuel supply company could use this workflow to track and analyze fuel prices in real-time, enabling them to make informed pricing decisions and optimize their supply chain operations.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up the webhook to receive fuel price data.
3. Connect Weaviate and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Customize the vector database index and Google Sheet ID.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample data to the webhook and verify the results in the Google Sheet.

### Practice
Create a test webhook and send sample fuel price data. Check how the workflow processes and logs the data in Google Sheets. Adjust the embeddings and splitter configurations to see how they impact data handling.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer advanced data monitoring and analysis solutions to businesses, enhancing decision-making capabilities. This can attract new clients in the logistics or energy sector, increasing your service offerings and income potential in the AI automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
