# Grid Load Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Grid Load Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/grid_load_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "grid_load_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "grid_load_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle grid load alerts. It starts with a webhook that receives POST requests containing grid load data. This data is processed and split into manageable chunks, then embedded using OpenAI's embeddings model. The processed data is stored in a Supabase vector database for future querying. An AI agent then interacts with the data to perform defined tasks, and the results are logged into a Google Sheet for record-keeping. This ensures efficient data handling and alert management.

### Demonstrate
A utility company could use this workflow to manage energy grid load alerts. By automating the data processing and logging, they can quickly identify and react to potential overloads, ensuring stable energy supply and preventing outages.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Supabase, OpenAI, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Configure the webhook to receive grid load data.
4. Set up the Google Sheet to log the results.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it processes correctly.

### Practice
Create a test webhook and send sample grid load data. Observe how the workflow processes and logs the data into Google Sheets. Adjust the data and test again to see how changes are handled.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can position you as a valuable asset in industries reliant on real-time data processing. By offering efficient alert management solutions, you can attract clients in energy, logistics, or any sector needing rapid data-driven responses, boosting your automation business potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
