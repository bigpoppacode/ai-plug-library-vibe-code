# Wind Farm Maintenance Scheduler
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Wind Farm Maintenance Scheduler", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/wind_farm_maintenance_scheduler`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "wind_farm_maintenance_scheduler"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "wind_farm_maintenance_scheduler"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the scheduling of wind farm maintenance using a series of AI-driven processes. It begins with a webhook that triggers the workflow when maintenance data is received. The data is split into manageable chunks, embedded into a vector store for easy retrieval, and queried using Weaviate. An AI agent processes this information to generate maintenance schedules and updates a Google Sheet with the results, ensuring efficient planning and record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A wind energy company could use this workflow to automate maintenance scheduling. By receiving data via a webhook, the system processes and schedules tasks, ensuring timely maintenance without manual intervention, optimizing turbine performance and reducing downtime.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive maintenance data.
3. Connect Weaviate and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Customize settings to match your data sources and storage.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it schedules and logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a sample webhook to send mock maintenance data. Observe how the workflow processes this data and updates the Google Sheet. Experiment by altering data inputs to see how the workflow adapts to different scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated scheduling solutions to wind energy companies, enhancing their operational efficiency. This can lead to new business opportunities, increased customer satisfaction, and a competitive edge in the AI automation market.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, weaviateApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
