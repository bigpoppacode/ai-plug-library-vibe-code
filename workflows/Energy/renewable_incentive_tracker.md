# Renewable Incentive Tracker
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Renewable Incentive Tracker", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/renewable_incentive_tracker`
4. **Insert** `vectorStorePinecone` — mode: "insert", indexName: "renewable_incentive_tracker"
5. **Query** `vectorStorePinecone` — indexName: "renewable_incentive_tracker"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Pinecone"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to track renewable energy incentives. It begins with a Webhook that receives data sent to a specific URL. The data is split into manageable chunks and processed into embeddings using Hugging Face's model. These embeddings are stored in a Pinecone vector database and queried for relevant information. The workflow uses an AI agent to interpret the data, and responses are logged into a Google Sheet, ensuring efficient data management and accessibility.

### Demonstrate
A business could use this workflow to automatically track and analyze renewable energy incentives, helping them stay informed about potential savings or grants, which could improve financial planning and decision-making.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Pinecone, Hugging Face, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up a Webhook to receive data, such as incentive details.
4. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure everything processes and logs correctly.

### Practice
Create a test webhook and send sample data mimicking renewable incentive information. Observe how the workflow processes and logs this data into a Google Sheet. Adjust the workflow to fit different types of incentive data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you provide data tracking and analysis services to clients, offering insights into renewable incentives. This can lead to new business opportunities, client satisfaction, and potential revenue growth in the energy sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, pineconeApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
