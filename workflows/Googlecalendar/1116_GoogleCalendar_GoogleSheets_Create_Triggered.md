  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the registration process for an event. It starts by capturing attendee registration data from a Typeform, then adds this data to a Google Sheet. It creates a Mattermost account for each attendee and invites them to a team. The workflow then processes session selections, updates Google Calendar events with the attendee's information, and sends a personalized welcome email via Gmail, confirming registration and providing login details for Mattermost.

### Demonstrate
A conference organizer can use this workflow to streamline event registration, ensuring attendees are registered, added to communication channels, and sent calendar invites and welcome emails automatically.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Typeform, Google Sheets, Mattermost, and Gmail accounts.
3. Set up a Typeform for event registrations.
4. Customize Google Sheets and Mattermost team settings.
5. Test the workflow by submitting a sample registration.

### Practice
Create a test Typeform with a few sample registrations. Run the workflow to observe how it processes each step, from adding data to Google Sheets to sending a welcome email. Modify a session choice and see how the workflow adapts.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
