# GoogleCalendar Schedule Create Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Output** `outputParserStructured` — schemaType: "manual", inputSchema: "{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "slots": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "start": { "type": "strin…[truncated]"
4. **Availability** `googleCalendarTool` — resource: **calendar**
5. **Model** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
6. **Meetings** `googleCalendarTool` — end: "={{ /*n8n-auto-generated-fromAI-override*/ $fromAI('End', ``, 'string') }}", start: "={{ /*n8n-auto-generated-fromAI-override*/ $fromAI('Start', ``, 'string') }}", calendar: "[object Object]"
7. **Model1** `lmChatOpenAi` — model: `[object Object]`
8. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "620", height: "420"
9. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "680", height: "600"
10. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "620", height: "580"
11. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "540", height: "520"
12. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "640", height: "560"
13. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — width: "420", height: "980", content: "## Try it out!
### This n8n template extends the idea of sales leads follow-up reminders by having an AI agent suggest and book the next call or message to reengage the prospect.

14. **Get Past Events** `googleCalendar` — operation: **getAll**
15. **Mark as Seen** `removeDuplicates` — operation: **removeItemsSeenInPreviousExecutions**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of scheduling follow-up meetings. It checks past Google Calendar events, identifies if follow-up emails were sent, and uses AI to suggest available slots for the next meeting. The user receives these suggestions and can approve or decline the booking.

### Demonstrate
A sales consultant could use this workflow to ensure timely follow-ups with leads. It automates checking for previous communications and suggests new meeting times, improving efficiency and increasing the likelihood of closing deals.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Calendar and Gmail accounts.
3. Set up the schedule trigger to match your workflow.
4. Customize the AI model's prompts and calendar settings.
5. Test the workflow with a few past events to ensure it suggests available slots correctly.

### Practice
Create a test calendar event and run the workflow to see if it correctly identifies the need for a follow-up. Adjust the AI model's prompts to better fit your communication style and test again to refine the process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you streamline client interactions, improving customer satisfaction and closing rates. It can enhance your service offerings and make your automation business more attractive to potential clients, leading to increased revenue opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleCalendarOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2, openAiApi.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
