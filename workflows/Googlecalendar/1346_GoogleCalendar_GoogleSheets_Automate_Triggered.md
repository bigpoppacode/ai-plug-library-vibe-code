# GoogleCalendar GoogleSheets Automate Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **New Event Entry Listener**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "1200", height: "280"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "1200", height: "280"
4. **New Event Entry Listener** `googleSheetsTrigger` — event: "rowAdded", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
5. **Event Date Formatter** `code` — jsCode: "// Get the last item from the input data
const lastEvent = items[items.length - 1].json;

// Extract relevant fields
const eventName = lastEvent["Event Name"];
const eventDescripti…[truncated]"
6. **Google Calendar Event Creator** `googleCalendar` — end: "={{ $json.startDate }}", start: "={{ $json.startDate }}", calendar: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating events in Google Calendar using data from a Google Sheet. When a new row is added to the sheet, the workflow triggers, formats the event date, and creates a corresponding event in Google Calendar. This eliminates the need for manual entry, ensuring accurate and efficient event management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically schedule team meetings by simply adding the meeting details to a shared Google Sheet. This ensures all team members are notified without the hassle of manual calendar updates.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Google Sheets and Google Calendar accounts.
3. Set up a Google Sheet with columns for event details.
4. Configure the sheet and calendar IDs in the workflow.
5. Test by adding a new event to the sheet and checking the calendar for updates.

### Practice
Create a test Google Sheet with event details. Run the workflow and observe how it adds events to your Google Calendar. Modify event details in the sheet and see the changes reflected in the calendar.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps streamline event management, saving time and reducing errors. It offers a valuable service to clients who need efficient scheduling solutions, potentially boosting your automation business and attracting more clients.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
