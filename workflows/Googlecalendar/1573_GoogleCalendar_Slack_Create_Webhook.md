# GoogleCalendar Slack Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky Note**.
  2. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/slack-meet-trigger`
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "463.09809221779403", height: "482.56534054190786"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "291.779972644588", height: "192.66150688057675"
5. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "292.3392628968803", height: "192.92455101677126"
6. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "459.2991776576996", height: "146.4269155371431"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "292.3392628968803", height: "192.92455101677126"
8. **Create event with google meet link** `googleCalendar` — end: "={{ $now.plus({minutes: 15}) }}", start: "={{ $now }}", calendar: "[object Object]"
9. **Send msg with Google meet link** `slack` — text: "=Join me here: {{ $('Create event with google meet link').item.json.hangoutLink }}", select: "channel", channelId: "[object Object]"
10. **Delete temporary calendar event** `googleCalendar` — operation: **delete**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow allows users to generate Google Meet links directly from Slack using a command. When a user posts a specific command in Slack, a webhook triggers the creation of a Google Meet event via Google Calendar. The link to this meeting is then sent back to the Slack channel. Finally, the temporary calendar event is deleted, ensuring that the calendar stays uncluttered.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to facilitate quick, impromptu meetings with team members. Instead of manually creating a link, they simply use a Slack command to instantly share a Google Meet link with their team, saving time and streamlining communication.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Slack app with the necessary permissions.
2. Configure the webhook in n8n to receive Slack commands.
3. Connect your Google Calendar account in n8n.
4. Customize the Slack message node to post the meeting link in a channel.
5. Test the workflow by triggering it from Slack.

### Practice
Create a test Slack channel and use the `/meet` command to trigger the workflow. Verify that a Google Meet link is generated and shared in the channel, and that the temporary event is deleted afterward.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enhances your ability to provide efficient communication solutions for teams. By offering such automation, you can attract clients looking to improve their internal collaboration, thereby expanding your service offerings and boosting your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
