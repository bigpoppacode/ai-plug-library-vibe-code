  ## üí° AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates certificate issuance for quiz takers. When a new row is added to a linked Google Sheet (indicating a quiz submission), the workflow extracts the participant's name, email, and score. If the score meets the passing criteria, a personalized certificate is created using Google Slides, converted to PDF, and emailed to the participant. If not, no action is taken.

### Demonstrate
A training company uses this workflow to automatically generate and send certificates to participants who pass their online courses, ensuring a seamless and efficient certification process without manual intervention.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Form linked to a Google Sheet.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Replace the Google Sheet ID and template IDs in the nodes.
4. Define the passing score in the "Score Checker" node.
5. Test with sample data to ensure it works.

### Practice
Create a Google Form quiz linked to a Google Sheet and run the workflow with test submissions. Adjust the passing score and customize the certificate template in Google Slides to see how changes affect the outcome.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you efficiently manage certification processes, offering a valuable service to educational institutions or training providers. This can enhance your service offerings and generate additional revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## üîß Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsTriggerOAuth2Api, googleDriveOAuth2Api, googleSlidesOAuth2Api, gmailOAuth2.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Ain‚Äôt the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That‚Äôs not the move.  

I'm closing $6k‚Äì$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### üß† Examples From My Own Playbook:
- üîÅ Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ‚öñÔ∏è Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms ‚Äî they paid $13,000 happily  
- üöÄ Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies ‚Äî using free OpenAI credits
