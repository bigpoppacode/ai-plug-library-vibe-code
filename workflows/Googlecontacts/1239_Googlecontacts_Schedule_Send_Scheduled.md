  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** Runs on a **schedule** (e.g., `[object Object]`).
  2. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1220", height: "320", content: "Send Daily Birthday Reminders from Google Contacts to Slack"
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "1220", height: "100", content: "This workflow automates the process of retrieving your Google Contacts, filtering out the ones with birthdays on the current day, and sending a reminder to a designated Slack chann…[truncated]"
5. **Google Contacts** `googleContacts` — operation: **getAll**
6. **Filter Contact ** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **If** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
8. **Slack** `slack` — text: "Todays Birthday of your friend", select: "channel", blocksUi: "=Today is {{$json["first_name"]}} {{$json["last_name"]}}'s birthday! 🎉"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This workflow automates sending daily birthday reminders by retrieving contacts from Google Contacts, filtering those with birthdays today, and sending a message to a specified Slack channel. It's scheduled to run daily, ensuring you never miss acknowledging a friend's birthday.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner could use this workflow to automate birthday reminders for team members, enhancing company culture by ensuring no birthday goes unnoticed, fostering a more connected and appreciative work environment.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow to n8n. Connect Google Contacts and Slack accounts. Set the schedule trigger to your preferred time. Customize the Slack message format if needed. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly identifies birthdays and sends messages.

- **Practice:** Create a test contact in Google Contacts with today's date as a birthday. Run the workflow to verify it correctly identifies the contact and sends a birthday message to your Slack channel. Adjust any settings if necessary.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow can help you offer personalized automation services, enhancing client engagement and satisfaction. It can be a unique selling point for your automation business, potentially increasing client retention and revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** slackOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
