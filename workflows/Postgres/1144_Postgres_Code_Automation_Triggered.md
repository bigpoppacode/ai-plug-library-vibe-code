# Postgres Code Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Drive Trigger**.
  2. **Google Drive Trigger** `googleDriveTrigger` — pollTimes: "[object Object]", triggerOn: "specificFile", fileToWatch: "[object Object]"
3. **execute_query_tool** `toolWorkflow` — name: "query_executer", schemaType: "manual", workflowId: "[object Object]"
4. **Google Gemini Chat Model** `lmChatGoogleGemini` — options: "[object Object]", modelName: "models/gemini-2.0-flash"
5. **get_postgres_schema** `toolWorkflow` — name: "get_postgres_schema", workflowId: "[object Object]", description: "Call this tool to retrieve the schema of all the tables inside of the database. A string will be retrieved with the name of the table and its columns, each table is separated by \n…[truncated]"
6. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
7. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "500", height: "260"
8. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "500", height: "280"
9. **When chat message received** `manualChatTrigger` — configured for its default action.
10. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "960", height: "460"
11. **change_this** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
12. **sql query executor** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
13. **schema finder** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
14. **AI Agent With SQL Query Prompt** `agent` — options: "[object Object]"
15. **table exists?** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
16. **response output** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
17. **schema to string** `code` — jsCode: "function transformSchema(input) {
    const tables = {};
    
    input.forEach(({ json }) => {
        if (!json) return;
        
        const { tablename, schemaname, column_na…[truncated]"
18. **fetch sheet data** `googleSheets` — options: "[object Object]", sheetName: "[object Object]", documentId: "[object Object]"
19. **is not in database** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
20. **remove table** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
21. **create table query** `code` — jsCode: "// Helper function to check if a string is in MM/DD/YYYY format
function isDateString(value) {
  const dateRegex = /^\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4}$/;
  if (typeof value !== 'string') return …[truncated]"
22. **create table** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
23. **create insertion query** `code` — jsCode: "const tableName = `ai_table_${$('change_this').first().json.sheet_name}`;
const rows = $('fetch sheet data').all();
const allColumns = new Set();

// Get column mapping from previo…[truncated]"
24. **perform insertion** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of updating a PostgreSQL database with data from a Google Sheets document. It starts by monitoring a specific Google Drive file for changes. When a change is detected, it checks if a corresponding table exists in the database. If not, it creates a new table and inserts the data from the Google Sheet into this table. It uses an AI agent to assist in generating SQL queries for these operations, ensuring data is accurately captured and stored.

**Demonstrate**  
A business analyst could use this workflow to automatically update their database with the latest sales data from a shared Google Sheet, ensuring that analysis and reporting tools always use current information.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n environment.  
2. Connect your Google Drive and PostgreSQL accounts.  
3. Set the Google Sheets document to watch.  
4. Run the workflow to test data transfer from the sheet to your database.  
5. Adjust table and column configurations to match your database schema.

**Practice**  
Create a Google Sheet with sample data and set up the workflow to monitor this file. Observe how the workflow creates and updates the corresponding database table. Modify the data in the sheet to see how changes are reflected in the database.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated data integration services, reducing manual data entry and errors for your clients. This can expand your service offerings, attract more clients, and increase your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, googlePalmApi, postgres, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
