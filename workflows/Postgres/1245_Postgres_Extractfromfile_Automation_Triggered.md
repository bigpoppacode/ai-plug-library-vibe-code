# Postgres Extractfromfile Automation Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Chat Trigger**.
  2. **Chat Trigger** `chatTrigger` — options: "[object Object]"
3. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "1505", height: "486"
4. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
5. **Ollama Chat Model** `lmChatOllama` — model: `phi4-mini:latest`
6. **WorkflowTrigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — workflowInputs: "[object Object]"
7. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "720", height: "540", content: "## This is triggered by chat or as a sub-workflow
Natural language requests can be asked, and a SQL query as well as its results will be returned."
8. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "340", height: "540", content: "## Quite the prompt 😅
Some refined prompt engineering work here.

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain:** This n8n workflow translates natural language queries about emails into SQL queries. It retrieves the email database schema, allows users to ask questions via chat, and returns the SQL query and its results. It helps users interact with databases using simple language.

- **Demonstrate:** A business owner can use this workflow to quickly generate SQL queries based on natural language questions, streamlining data retrieval from an email database for reporting or analysis purposes.

- **Imitate:** Import the workflow into n8n, connect your email database, and set up the chat trigger. Customize the chat model to fit your data schema and test the workflow by asking natural language questions related to your email data.

- **Practice:** Set up a test database with sample email data. Use the workflow to ask questions like "Show emails from last week" and observe how it generates and executes SQL queries to retrieve the desired information.

- **WIIFM:** Mastering this workflow allows you to offer AI-powered data interaction services, enabling clients to access their email databases effortlessly. This can enhance your service offerings, attract clients seeking advanced data solutions, and boost your automation business revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
