# Postgres Googlecloudnaturallanguage Automation Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Monitors events, processes them, and **notifies** people/apps (Slack/Email) with structured updates.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Cron**.
  2. **Cron** `cron` — triggerTimes: "[object Object]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of retrieving tweets with the hashtag #OnThisDay from Twitter, analyzing their sentiment using Google Cloud Natural Language, and storing the results in a Postgres database. If a tweet's sentiment score is above a certain threshold, it sends a notification to a Slack channel. This workflow helps in monitoring social media sentiment efficiently.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to track brand sentiment over time, allowing for timely responses to negative feedback or capitalizing on positive trends. For example, a marketing team could use this to adjust campaigns based on daily sentiment analysis.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Twitter, Google Cloud, Postgres, and Slack accounts.
3. Set the trigger time in the Cron node.
4. Customize the Twitter search term and sentiment score threshold.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly processes and notifies as expected.

### Practice
Set up a test environment with a few tweets, and run the workflow to observe how it processes sentiment and sends Slack notifications. Adjust the sentiment threshold to see how it affects which tweets trigger notifications.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer real-time sentiment analysis services, helping businesses track and respond to brand perception. This can enhance your service offerings, leading to increased client satisfaction and business growth in the automation sector.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** twitterOAuth1Api, postgres, mongoDb, slackApi, googleCloudNaturalLanguageOAuth2Api.
2. **Cron/Schedule:** Confirm timezone and cadence; start with a test window (e.g., every 5 minutes) then scale.
3. **Notification Targets:** Confirm channel/email IDs and that the bot/app is authorized to post.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
