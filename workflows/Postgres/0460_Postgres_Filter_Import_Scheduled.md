# Postgres Filter Import Scheduled
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking "Test workflow"**.
  2. **When clicking "Test workflow"** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Schedule Trigger** `scheduleTrigger` — rule: "[object Object]"
4. **Set Vars** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
5. **Get All Workflows** `n8n` — filters: "[object Object]"
6. **Exclude default_error:false Tagged Workflows** `filter` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
7. **Set Default Error Workflow** `postgres` — operation: **update**, table: `[object Object]`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of setting a default error workflow for all workflows that don't have one assigned and aren't tagged with "default_error:false". It runs on a schedule, retrieves all workflows, filters out those tagged to exclude, and updates the database to set a default error workflow.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business owner can use this workflow to ensure all their automation workflows have a fallback error handler, preventing workflow failures from going unnoticed and enhancing system reliability.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Connect your database credentials.
3. Adjust the schedule settings as needed.
4. Test the workflow to ensure it correctly updates workflows without error handlers.

**Practice:**  
Create a few test workflows in n8n, some with and some without error handlers. Run the main workflow and observe how it updates only those without error handlers, setting a default one.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can help you offer robust automation solutions, ensuring clients' workflows are resilient and reducing downtime. This reliability can attract more clients and justify premium pricing in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres, n8nApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
