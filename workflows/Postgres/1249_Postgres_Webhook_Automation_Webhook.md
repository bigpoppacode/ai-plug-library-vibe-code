# Postgres Webhook Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Create Note**.
2. **Create Note** `postgresTool` — operation: **executeQuery**
3. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "330.5152611046425", height: "239.5888196628349"
4. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "636", height: "657"
5. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280", height: "626"
6. **Scenario 1 Start - Edit Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
7. **Scenario 2 Start - Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/d074ca1e-52f9-47af-8587-8c24d431f9cd`
8. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "920", height: "400", content: "## Scenario 1

"
9. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "1020", height: "420", content: "## Scenario 2

"
10. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "270", height: "80"
11. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "200", height: "80"
12. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "4", width: "270", height: "80"
13. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "290", height: "80"
14. **Sticky Note8** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "200", height: "80"
15. **Create Recall bot** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://us-west-2.recall.ai/api/v1/bot`
16. **Insert Transcription Part** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
17. **Create OpenAI thread** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.openai.com/v1/threads`
18. **If Jimmy word** `if` — options: "[object Object]", conditions: "[object Object]"
19. **Create data record** `supabase` — table: `data`
20. **OpenAI1** `openAi` — resource: **assistant**, prompt: "define"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow automates real-time transcription and analysis of virtual meetings. It creates a recall bot to join meetings, transcribes the conversation using AssemblyAI, and stores the transcriptions in a database. It can trigger actions like note creation or data analysis based on specific keywords or conditions using OpenAI and Supabase.

**Demonstrate:**  
A business could use this workflow to automate meeting minutes and action item tracking, ensuring nothing is missed and reducing manual note-taking efforts.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up API keys for Recall.ai, OpenAI, and Supabase.
3. Configure webhook and database settings.
4. Test with a mock meeting URL to ensure the bot joins and transcribes correctly.

**Practice:**  
Create a test meeting with a few participants. Use the workflow to capture the transcription and verify that keywords trigger the expected actions, like creating notes or records.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow can position you as an expert in meeting automation, offering services that enhance productivity and data accuracy for businesses. This can lead to increased client engagement and new revenue streams for your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, postgres, httpHeaderAuth, supabaseApi.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
