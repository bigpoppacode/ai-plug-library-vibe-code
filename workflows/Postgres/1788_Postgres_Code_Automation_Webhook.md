# Postgres Code Automation Webhook
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **When clicking ‘Test workflow’**.
2. **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** `manualTrigger` — configured for its default action.
3. **Execute Workflow Trigger** `executeWorkflowTrigger` — configured for its default action.
4. **create_table** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "3440", height: "720"
6. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — color: "6", width: "780", height: "280"
7. **see table** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
8. **drop table** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
9. **Postgres** `postgres` — operation: **executeQuery**
10. **sanitize_data** `code` — jsCode: "const now = new Date();
const twoWeeksAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 14 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

const bestPerformingVideos = [];

$input.all().forEach(channel => {
  
  const aver…[truncated]"

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of identifying and analyzing the best performing YouTube videos from specific channels over the past two weeks. It fetches video data, filters out shorts, excludes top and bottom performers, and calculates engagement scores. The results are stored in a database for further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A YouTube content manager could use this workflow to automatically gather and analyze data on their videos. This helps identify which content resonates best with audiences, guiding future content strategies to maximize engagement and growth.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Postgres database and YouTube API credentials.
3. Adjust the YouTube channel IDs in the workflow to match those you want to analyze.
4. Test the workflow by running it manually to ensure it fetches and processes data correctly.
5. Schedule the workflow for regular execution, such as weekly.

### Practice
Create a mock database and input a few video records manually. Run the workflow to see how it processes the data and populates the database with best-performing videos. Experiment by changing video engagement metrics to observe how the workflow adapts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer data-driven insights to content creators, helping them refine their strategies and increase viewer engagement. This can enhance your service offerings, attract more clients, and generate additional income in the AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** postgres, youTubeOAuth2Api.
2. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
