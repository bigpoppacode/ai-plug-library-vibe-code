# Inventory Restock Forecast
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Inventory Restock Forecast", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/inventory_restock_forecast`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "inventory_restock_forecast"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "inventory_restock_forecast"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to forecast inventory restocks. It starts with a POST request to a webhook, which triggers the process. Data is then split into chunks and converted into embeddings using Cohere. These embeddings are stored in a Supabase vector database. The workflow queries this database to make predictions and uses an AI chat model to refine the forecast. Finally, the forecast is saved in a Google Sheet for record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A retail business could use this workflow to predict when they need to restock items. By analyzing past sales data, the workflow helps ensure products are always available, reducing stockouts and improving customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Supabase, Cohere, and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up a POST endpoint for data input.
4. Customize the Supabase index and Google Sheet to match your data structure.
5. Test the workflow with sample data to ensure it forecasts correctly.

### Practice
Create a test dataset with sales history and run the workflow. Check the Google Sheet to see the forecast results. Try adjusting parameters like chunk size or embedding model to see how predictions change.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer inventory forecasting services, helping businesses optimize stock levels and reduce costs. This skill can increase your value as a consultant and open opportunities in supply chain management automation.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
