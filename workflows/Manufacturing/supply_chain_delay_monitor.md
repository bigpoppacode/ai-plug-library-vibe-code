# Supply Chain Delay Monitor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Supply Chain Delay Monitor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/supply_chain_delay_monitor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "supply_chain_delay_monitor"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "supply_chain_delay_monitor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This workflow is designed to monitor supply chain delays. It captures information via a webhook, processes the data by splitting text and creating embeddings, stores and queries this data in a Supabase vector store, and uses AI to analyze and log insights into Google Sheets. This provides a structured approach to understanding and managing potential supply chain disruptions.

**Demonstrate:**  
A logistics manager might use this workflow to monitor supply chain updates. If a delay is reported, the system processes the data, evaluates the impact using AI, and logs the information, allowing for proactive management and communication with stakeholders.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to capture supply chain alerts.
3. Connect your Supabase and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Customize text processing and AI settings.
5. Test the system by sending sample data through the webhook.

**Practice:**  
Create a test scenario where you simulate a supply chain delay by sending a mock alert to the webhook. Observe how the workflow processes and logs the data. Experiment with different text inputs to see how the AI analysis varies.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer a valuable service to businesses needing real-time supply chain monitoring. This can enhance operational efficiency and decision-making, providing a competitive edge and opening new revenue streams in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
