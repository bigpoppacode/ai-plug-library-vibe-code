# Packaging Waste Calculator
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Packaging Waste Calculator", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/packaging_waste_calculator`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "packaging_waste_calculator"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "packaging_waste_calculator"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain**  
This n8n workflow is designed to handle packaging waste data. It begins with receiving data via a webhook, processes this data by splitting it into manageable chunks, and uses AI to generate embeddings. These embeddings are stored and queried from a Redis vector database. The results are then processed by an AI agent and logged into a Google Sheet, providing a structured way to manage and analyze packaging waste information.

**Demonstrate**  
A business might use this workflow to manage and analyze data related to packaging waste, helping them identify inefficiencies and improve sustainability practices, thereby reducing costs and meeting regulatory requirements.

**Imitate**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.  
2. Set up the webhook to receive data.  
3. Connect Redis and Google Sheets accounts.  
4. Customize the workflow to match your data structure.  
5. Test the workflow to ensure it processes and logs data correctly.

**Practice**  
Create a test dataset with packaging information and run it through the workflow. Check the Google Sheet to see how the data is logged and use the AI agent to analyze trends or patterns in the data.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer clients efficient data processing and analysis services, helping them optimize their packaging processes. This can lead to increased business opportunities as companies seek to improve their environmental impact and reduce costs.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, redisApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
