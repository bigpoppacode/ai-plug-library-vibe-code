3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/maintenance_ticket_router`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "maintenance_ticket_router"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "maintenance_ticket_router"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"

  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the processing of maintenance tickets. It starts with a Webhook that receives ticket data, splits the text for processing, and creates embeddings using Cohere. The data is stored in a Supabase vector store for querying. An AI agent processes the ticket data and logs it in a Google Sheet, ensuring efficient handling and record-keeping.

### Demonstrate
A property management company could use this workflow to automatically process maintenance requests from tenants. This ensures that all requests are logged, categorized, and responded to efficiently, reducing manual workload and improving tenant satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect Supabase, Cohere, and Google Sheets.
3. Set up the Webhook to receive ticket data.
4. Customize the splitter and AI agent to match your ticket format.
5. Test the workflow to ensure it logs data correctly.

### Practice
Create a test maintenance ticket and submit it via the Webhook. Observe how the workflow processes the ticket, stores it in Supabase, and logs it in Google Sheets. Adjust settings to improve processing accuracy.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated ticket processing services, enhancing operational efficiency for clients. This can lead to cost savings and increased client satisfaction, positioning you as a valuable partner in automation solutions.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, supabaseApi, huggingFaceApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
