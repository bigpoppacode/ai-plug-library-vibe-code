# Production Kpi Dashboard
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Production KPI Dashboard", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/production_kpi_dashboard`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "production_kpi_dashboard"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "production_kpi_dashboard"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatOpenAi` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsCohere` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to create a "Production KPI Dashboard." It starts by receiving data via a webhook, which is then split and processed to generate embeddings using Cohere. These embeddings are stored in a Weaviate vector database. The workflow queries this database to retrieve relevant data, which is then processed by an AI agent using OpenAI to define or interpret the data. Finally, the processed information is logged into a Google Sheet for record-keeping and analysis.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically update a dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) by integrating various data sources, ensuring management always has the latest insights without manual updates.

### Imitate
1. Set up a webhook to receive KPI data.
2. Use the text splitter to chunk data.
3. Generate embeddings and store them in Weaviate.
4. Query Weaviate for relevant data.
5. Use AI to interpret data and log results in Google Sheets.

### Practice
Create a test webhook to input sample KPI data. Run the workflow to see how it processes and logs the data in Google Sheets. Adjust the input data and observe changes in the outputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated data processing and dashboard updates as a service, providing clients with real-time insights. This can enhance decision-making, save time, and potentially increase your business revenue by offering a valuable, scalable service.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** cohereApi, weaviateApi, openAiApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
