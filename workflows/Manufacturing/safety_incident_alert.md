# Safety Incident Alert
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Safety Incident Alert", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/safety_incident_alert`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreRedis` — mode: "insert", indexName: "safety_incident_alert"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreRedis` — indexName: "safety_incident_alert"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Redis"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow is designed to handle safety incident alerts. It starts by receiving incident data via a webhook. The data is then split, embedded, and stored in a Redis vector database for efficient querying. The workflow uses AI to analyze the incident details and stores the results in Google Sheets for record-keeping and further analysis.

### Demonstrate
A manufacturing company could use this workflow to automate the logging and analysis of safety incidents. It ensures incidents are recorded systematically, analyzed for insights, and stored for compliance and future reference, enhancing workplace safety management.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive safety incident data.
3. Connect to your Redis and Google Sheets accounts.
4. Configure the workflow to match your data structure.
5. Test the workflow with sample incident data to ensure it logs and analyzes correctly.

### Practice
Create a test incident report and send it to the webhook. Verify how the workflow processes and stores the data in Google Sheets. Try modifying the incident details to see how the workflow adapts and logs different scenarios.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer comprehensive safety incident management solutions. This can attract clients in industries like manufacturing and construction, helping them improve safety compliance and efficiency, thus expanding your automation business and increasing revenue potential.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, redisApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
