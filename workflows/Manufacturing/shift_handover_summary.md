# Shift Handover Summary
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Shift Handover Summary", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/shift_handover_summary`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreSupabase` — mode: "insert", indexName: "shift_handover_summary"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreSupabase` — indexName: "shift_handover_summary"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Supabase"
7. **Chat** `lmChatHf` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsHuggingFace` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow automates the process of creating shift handover summaries. It starts by receiving data via a webhook, splits the text into manageable chunks, and generates embeddings using Hugging Face. These embeddings are stored in a Supabase vector store. The workflow then queries this store to retrieve related information, processes it with an AI agent, and logs the final output into a Google Sheet.

### Demonstrate
A healthcare facility could use this workflow to automate the creation of shift handover reports, ensuring that all critical information is summarized and logged efficiently, reducing errors and saving staff time.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your Supabase and Google Sheets accounts.
3. Set up a POST webhook to receive shift data.
4. Customize the Google Sheet to store the summaries.
5. Test the workflow by sending sample shift data through the webhook.

### Practice
Create a test scenario where you simulate a shift handover by posting data to the webhook. Check how the workflow processes the data and logs it into the Google Sheet. Experiment with different data formats to see how the AI agent handles them.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated reporting solutions to clients, improving their operational efficiency. By reducing manual data handling, you can help businesses minimize errors and save time, making your automation services more valuable and in demand.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** huggingFaceApi, supabaseApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
