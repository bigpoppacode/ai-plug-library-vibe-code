# Machine Downtime Predictor
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Sticky**.
  2. **Sticky** `stickyNote` — content: "## Machine Downtime Predictor", height: "520", width: "1100"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/machine_downtime_predictor`
4. **Insert** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — mode: "insert", indexName: "machine_downtime_predictor"
5. **Query** `vectorStoreWeaviate` — indexName: "machine_downtime_predictor"
6. **Tool** `toolVectorStore` — name: "Weaviate"
7. **Chat** `lmChatAnthropic` — configured for its default action.
8. **Agent** `agent` — promptType: "define", text: "={{ $json }}"
9. **Splitter** `textSplitterCharacterTextSplitter` — chunkSize: "400", chunkOverlap: "40"
10. **Memory** `memoryBufferWindow` — configured for its default action.
11. **Sheet** `googleSheets` — operation: **append**
12. **Embeddings** `embeddingsOpenAi` — model: `default`
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This workflow predicts machine downtime by processing data through various AI and data handling nodes. It starts with a webhook that receives data, which is then split into chunks and embedded for vector storage. These embeddings are inserted into and queried from a vector store. The workflow uses an AI chat model to interpret the data, which is then logged into a Google Sheet for tracking.

### Demonstrate
A manufacturing company could use this workflow to predict when their machines might fail, allowing them to perform timely maintenance and reduce unexpected downtime, which can save costs and improve efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a webhook to receive machine data.
3. Connect to Weaviate and OpenAI for vector storage and embeddings.
4. Configure Google Sheets to log predictions.
5. Test with sample data to ensure predictions are logged correctly.

### Practice
Create a test dataset with machine operation logs, set up the workflow to process this data, and observe how predictions are logged in Google Sheets. Adjust parameters to see how predictions vary with different data inputs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer predictive maintenance solutions, reducing operational costs for clients. This can attract manufacturing clients looking to optimize their operations, thereby increasing your service offerings and potential revenue.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi, weaviateApi, anthropicApi, googleSheetsOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
