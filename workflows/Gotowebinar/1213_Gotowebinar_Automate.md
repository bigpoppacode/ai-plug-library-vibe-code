  ### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation and updating of webinars using the GoToWebinar service. It first creates a new webinar with specified details like subject and time. It then updates this webinar with a description and any other needed information. This ensures that webinars are set up correctly and consistently without manual input, saving time and reducing errors.

### Demonstrate
A training company could use this workflow to automatically set up and update webinars for their courses, ensuring consistency and saving time on manual setup.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Connect your GoToWebinar account.
3. Adjust the webinar details (subject, time, description) as needed.
4. Test the workflow to ensure webinars are created and updated correctly.

### Practice
Create a test webinar in GoToWebinar and run the workflow to see how it sets up and updates the webinar. Modify the subject or description and observe how changes are applied.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated webinar management services, streamlining operations for clients and creating opportunities for recurring income in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
