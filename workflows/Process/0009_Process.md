# Process
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using function×4, merge.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Merge**.
  2. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "mergeByKey", propertyName1: "interviewers[0].id", propertyName2: "fields.eid"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  ### Explain
This n8n workflow merges data from two sources based on matching keys. It takes a list of interviewers from one data set and a list of employee details from another data set. By using the "mergeByKey" functionality, it matches and combines records where the interviewer's ID matches the employee's ID, effectively enriching the interviewer data with additional details from the employee records.

### Demonstrate
A business might use this workflow to integrate HR systems, combining interview data with employee records to ensure that all relevant information is available for decision-making in recruitment.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Prepare your data sources with similar structure and keys.
3. Modify the merge node keys to match your data fields.
4. Run the workflow to see how it merges data from two sources.
5. Adjust and test with your actual data to ensure accuracy.

### Practice
Create a small test set with two JSON arrays: one with basic user info and another with detailed profiles. Use the workflow to merge these based on a common identifier, like a user ID, to see how it combines the data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can help you offer data integration services, allowing businesses to consolidate and enrich their data efficiently. This skill is valuable for creating insights, improving processes, and offering higher-value solutions in your automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Test & Activate:** Run a manual execution with sample data, then set the workflow Active.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
