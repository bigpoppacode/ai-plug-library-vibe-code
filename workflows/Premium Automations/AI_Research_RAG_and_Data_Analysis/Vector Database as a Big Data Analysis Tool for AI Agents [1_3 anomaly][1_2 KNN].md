4. **Step 3: Get fields for Qdrant (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Qdrant cluster variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Embed crop image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Create Qdrant Collection (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Check Qdrant Collection Existence (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Batches in the API's format (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Batch Upload to Qdrant (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Split in batches, generate uuids for Qdrant points (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: If collection exists (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Payload index on crop_name (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
21. **Step 20: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
22. **Step 21: Sticky Note9 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
23. **Step 22: Sticky Note11 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
24. **Step 23: Filtering out tomato to test anomalies (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
25. **Step 24: Sticky Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
26. **Step 25: Sticky Note10 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of uploading a dataset of crop images to Qdrant, a vector database, for anomaly detection. It fetches images from Google Cloud Storage, creates embeddings using an AI model, and organizes the data for efficient querying.

### Demonstrate
A business owner may use this workflow to automate the management of crop images for a precision agriculture AI. This helps in quickly identifying crop anomalies, ultimately improving yield predictions and reducing losses.

### Imitate
1. Start n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Implement a **Google Cloud Storage** node to fetch images.
4. Use **HTTP Request** nodes to create a Qdrant collection and check its existence.
5. Embed images and upload them in batches to Qdrant.
6. Test the workflow and adjust parameters as necessary.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow to upload a different dataset (e.g., animal images). Change the Google Cloud Storage node to point to your new dataset and update the embedding model in the HTTP Request node.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to clients in agriculture or AI, helping them streamline data management and analysis. This can lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and new revenue opportunities in your automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note10" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
