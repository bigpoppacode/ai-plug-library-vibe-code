## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, httpRequest, splitOut.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Test workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Test workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Fetch Source Image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Split Out Results Only (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Filter Score >= 0.9 (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Crop Object From Image (editImage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set Variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Use Detr-Resnet-50 Object Classification (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Upload to Cloudinary (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Create Docs In Elasticsearch (elasticsearch)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Fetch Source Image Again (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note8 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of image analysis and management. It triggers when initiated, fetches an image, classifies objects within it using AI, crops detected objects, uploads them to Cloudinary, and indexes the results in Elasticsearch, facilitating an image search capability.

### Demonstrate
A business owner with an e-commerce store could use this workflow to analyze product images. By automatically cropping and classifying objects, they can create a searchable database of product images, enhancing user experience and improving inventory management.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Use an HTTP request node to fetch an image from a URL.
3. Split the results to focus on classified objects.
4. Filter objects with a score of 0.9 or higher.
5. Crop the identified objects, set necessary variables, and classify them using AI.
6. Upload the cropped images to Cloudinary and create documents in Elasticsearch for indexing.

### Practice
To reinforce your understanding, modify the workflow to work with a different image source or classification model. Experiment by changing the image URL and observing how the outputs vary based on different objects detected.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, enhancing their operational efficiency. By automating image processing, you can help clients save time, improve product management, and potentially increase sales, positioning yourself as a go-to expert in AI-driven automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Test workflow"" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
