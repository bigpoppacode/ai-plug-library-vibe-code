# Automated Hugging Face Paper Summary Fetching & Categorization Workflow

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, httpRequest, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Embed image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get similarity of medoids (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Compare scores (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Variables for medoids (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Info About Crop Labeled Clusters (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Total Points in Collection (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Each Crop Counts (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Image URL hardcode (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note22 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Breakdown of the n8n Workflow Using the EDIP Method

**Explain:**  
This n8n workflow detects anomalies in crop images. It accepts an image URL, generates embeddings using the Voyage AI API, queries a Qdrant vector database for similarities, and checks if the image belongs to known crop types or is considered anomalous.

**Demonstrate:**  
A farmer receives a suspicious crop image. Instead of manually identifying it, they use this workflow to input the image URL. The system analyzes it and instantly informs them if it's an anomaly, saving time and improving crop management decisions.

**Imitate:**  
1. Set up an n8n instance and create a new workflow.
2. Add a webhook trigger to accept incoming image URLs.
3. Use the HTTP request node to send the image URL to the Voyage AI API for embedding.
4. Query the Qdrant database to compare the embeddings against known crops.
5. Implement a code node to evaluate the similarity scores and determine if it's an anomaly.
6. Set up a notification node (e.g., email or Slack) to send the results back to the user.

**Practice:**  
Try running the workflow with a known crop image URL and an unknown crop image URL. Observe how the system identifies each one. Modify the workflow to include additional crops or change the threshold for what constitutes an anomaly.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow empowers you to offer valuable AI-driven solutions to farmers and agricultural businesses, enhancing their decision-making processes. This expertise can attract clients, generate income, and position you as a leader in agricultural technology automation.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note1" and "Sticky Note22" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
