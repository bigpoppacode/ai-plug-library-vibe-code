# Vector Database As A Big Data Analysis Tool For AI Agents [3 3   Anomaly]

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, httpRequest, code.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Embed image (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Get similarity of medoids (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Compare scores (code)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Variables for medoids (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Info About Crop Labeled Clusters (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Total Points in Collection (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Each Crop Counts (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Image URL hardcode (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note22 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates crop anomaly detection by analyzing images against a predefined dataset of known crops. It utilizes various APIs and logic to determine if an incoming image is an anomaly, enhancing agricultural data management.

### Demonstrate
A farmer receives images of crops and wants to identify anomalies. This workflow can automatically analyze each image, compare it to known crops, and alert the farmer if an unknown crop is detected, saving time and improving yield management.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Webhook Trigger for image uploads.
3. Use HTTP Request nodes to send the image to an embedding API (like Voyage.ai).
4. Query a vector database (like Qdrant) to compare embeddings.
5. Use a Code node to assess similarity scores and determine if an anomaly exists.
6. Return the results via the Webhook.

### Practice
Create a simplified version of this workflow by uploading a predefined image of a crop. Test the workflow to see if it identifies the crop correctly and returns a message indicating whether it’s known or anomalous.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can empower you to offer valuable automation services in agriculture, enhancing crop management and anomaly detection for clients. This skill can lead to increased customer satisfaction and new business opportunities in the agri-tech sector.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note1" and "Sticky Note22" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
