## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow generates SEO seed keywords using AI based on a defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP). It collects input data about the customer's needs and goals, processes it through an AI model, and outputs a list of relevant keywords for SEO strategies.

### Demonstrate
A business owner wants to enhance their online presence. They can use this workflow to automatically generate a list of targeted SEO keywords based on their ideal customers’ profiles, saving time and improving search engine visibility.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Start with a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Add a **Set Node** to define your ICP.
4. Use the **Anthropic Chat Model** to process the ICP and generate keywords.
5. Connect to a **Split Out Node** to manage responses.
6. Finalize with a **Sticky Note** to display or log the generated keywords.

### Practice
Try adapting the workflow by changing the ICP details and testing the output keywords. Experiment with different profiles to see how the AI-generated keywords change based on varying customer needs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow helps you automate keyword generation, a crucial aspect of digital marketing. This skill can attract clients looking to improve their SEO strategies, positioning you as a valuable resource in automation and AI-driven marketing solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
