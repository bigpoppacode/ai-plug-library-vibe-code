# Query Perplexity AI From Your N8n Workflows

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, httpRequest.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Set Params (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Clean Output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Perplexity Request (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates a process triggered by a manual click. It sets parameters for a system prompt and user query, sends a request to an AI service (Perplexity), cleans the output, and creates sticky notes for instructions and information.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate responses to customer inquiries. When a customer asks a question, the workflow fetches AI-driven answers, saving time and ensuring consistent communication without manual input.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Use a **Set** node to define parameters (e.g., system prompt, user prompt).
4. Connect an **HTTP Request** node to send the parameters to an AI API.
5. Use a **Set** node to clean and format the AI's output.
6. Add **Sticky Note** nodes for instructions and notes.

### Practice
Try modifying the parameters in the **Set** node. Change the user prompt to ask a different question and observe how the output from the AI changes. This will reinforce your understanding of how input affects the response.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to streamline customer interactions, reduce response times, and enhance service quality, making you more attractive to potential clients and increasing your revenue as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
