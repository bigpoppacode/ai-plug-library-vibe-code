## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching relevant Reddit posts about "n8n," filtering them based on criteria (like upvotes and recency), classifying their content using OpenAI, and summarizing the findings.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to monitor discussions about their product on Reddit, gaining insights into customer sentiment and trends, which can inform marketing strategies and product improvements.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Add a Reddit node to search for posts containing your keyword.
3. Use the Set node to filter the posts based on engagement metrics.
4. Implement OpenAI nodes to classify and summarize the content.
5. Connect to a data storage node (like Google Sheets) to record results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to track another topic of interest, like customer feedback on your competitors. Adjust the Reddit search parameters and see how the results change.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to provide valuable insights for businesses, helping them stay ahead of trends and customer needs, which can attract clients seeking data-driven decision-making solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
