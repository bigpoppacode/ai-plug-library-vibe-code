## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of creating event banners. It captures form data, generates an AI image based on user inputs, uploads it to Cloudinary, and then uses Bannerbear to create a visually appealing banner, which is sent to Discord for sharing.

### Demonstrate
A business owner hosting an event can use this workflow to quickly generate promotional banners. Instead of designing each banner manually, they can fill out a form, and the workflow will handle design and posting automatically, saving time and resources.

### Imitate
1. Set up an n8n instance and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Form Trigger node to capture event details.
3. Use the OpenAI node to generate an image based on the provided prompt.
4. Upload the generated image to Cloudinary.
5. Configure the Bannerbear node to create a banner using the uploaded image and event details.
6. Send the final banner to Discord.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to change the banner template or add additional fields to the form. Experiment with different image prompts to see how the AI-generated images change based on input.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate marketing tasks, providing value to clients by saving them time and enhancing their promotional efforts. This can lead to more clients and increased income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "n8n Form Trigger" and "Generate AI Banner Image" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
