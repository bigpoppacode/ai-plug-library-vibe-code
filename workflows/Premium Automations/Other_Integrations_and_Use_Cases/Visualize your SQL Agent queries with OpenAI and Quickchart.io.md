# Visualize Your Sql Agent Queries With Openai And Quickchart.io

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving lmChatOpenAi, executeWorkflow, executeWorkflowTrigger.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Execute "Generate a chart" tool** node.
2. **Step 1: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Execute Workflow (executeWorkflow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Execute "Generate a chart" tool (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: OpenAI - Generate Chart definition with Structured Output (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Set response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Set Text output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Set Text + Chart output (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: AI Agent (agent)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Window Buffer Memory (memoryBufferWindow)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: OpenAI Chat Model Classifier (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: Text Classifier - Chart required? (textClassifier)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
18. **Step 17: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
19. **Step 18: User question + Agent initial response (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
20. **Step 19: Information Extractor - User question (informationExtractor)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of interacting with an SQL database using an AI agent. It can extract user questions, determine if a chart is needed, and generate visualizations based on SQL query results, providing users with both data and visual insights.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to streamline data analysis. For instance, a coffee shop owner might want to visualize sales trends. By asking the AI agent, they can receive both data and a chart to better understand sales performance over time.

### Imitate
1. **Open n8n** and create a new workflow.
2. **Add a Trigger Node** (e.g., Webhook for user questions).
3. **Insert an AI Agent Node** to handle the SQL query.
4. **Add a Text Classifier Node** to determine if a chart is needed.
5. **Implement a Chart Generation Node** using Quickchart.io.
6. **Set up a response node** to send back the data and chart.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to connect to your own database. Change the SQL queries to match your data structure and test it by asking different questions to see how the AI agent responds with both text and charts.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow equips you with the ability to provide businesses with valuable insights through automation, enhancing your service offerings. This can lead to increased client satisfaction and open doors for higher-paying projects in data analysis and visualization.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "OpenAI Chat Model" and "Information Extractor - User question" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
