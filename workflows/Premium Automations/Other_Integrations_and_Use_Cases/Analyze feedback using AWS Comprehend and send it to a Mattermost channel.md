## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates customer feedback analysis by collecting responses from a Typeform, analyzing sentiment using AWS Comprehend, and sending alerts to Mattermost if the sentiment is negative. It streamlines the feedback process for businesses.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically assess event feedback. If a customer rates their experience poorly, the owner is instantly notified via Mattermost, allowing for quick response and improvement, enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Typeform to collect feedback.
2. Add a Typeform Trigger node in n8n.
3. Use AWS Comprehend to analyze sentiment.
4. Create an IF node to check for negative feedback.
5. Connect to a Mattermost node to send alerts.

### Practice
Create a mock Typeform and simulate feedback submissions. Test the workflow by submitting both positive and negative feedback, observing how the alerts are triggered based on sentiment analysis.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer businesses a valuable service—automated customer feedback analysis. This can lead to improved customer relations and retention, making you a sought-after consultant in automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Mattermost" and "Typeform Trigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
