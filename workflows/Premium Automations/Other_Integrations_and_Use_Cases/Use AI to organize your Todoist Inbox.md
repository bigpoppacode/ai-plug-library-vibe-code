## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates task management by updating task priorities in Todoist based on new inbox tasks. It uses OpenAI to categorize tasks and ensures that only non-subtasks are processed, enhancing productivity and organization.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically prioritize tasks daily, ensuring their team focuses on high-impact items. For instance, a project manager could streamline daily task management, improving team efficiency.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your Todoist and OpenAI credentials.
3. Customize the task priority settings in the "Your Projects" node.
4. Adjust the schedule in the "Schedule Trigger" node to your preference.
5. Execute the workflow and observe task updates in Todoist.

### Practice
Create a simple test workflow that retrieves tasks from Todoist and logs them in a Google Sheet. This will help you understand how to manipulate task data and integrate different services.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you and your clients time, improve task organization, and enhance productivity. This skill can lead to high-value automation services, helping you attract more clients and generate income.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Update priority in todoist" and "If other or ai hallucinates" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
