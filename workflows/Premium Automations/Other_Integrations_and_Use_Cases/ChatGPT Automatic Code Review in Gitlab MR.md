## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of reviewing code changes from GitLab merge requests. It captures changes, analyzes them with AI, and posts reviews back to GitLab, streamlining feedback and collaboration for developers.

### Demonstrate
A software development team uses this workflow to automatically review code submitted through GitLab. Instead of manually checking each merge request, the AI analyzes changes and provides feedback, saving time and improving code quality.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up a Webhook trigger for GitLab merge requests.
3. Connect your GitLab account and configure API tokens.
4. Customize the AI prompt to reflect your review criteria.
5. Test the workflow with a sample merge request and adjust parameters as needed.

### Practice
Try modifying the AI prompt in the workflow to see how different instructions affect the feedback it generates. Submit a test merge request in GitLab and monitor the responses to learn how to refine the review process.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated code review services to clients, enhancing their development processes. This can lead to cost savings, faster deployments, and ultimately generate income as part of your automation consulting business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
