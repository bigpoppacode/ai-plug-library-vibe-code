# Classify New Bugs In Linear With Openai S Gpt 4 And Move Them To The Right Team

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving linearTrigger, filter, stickyNote.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Linear Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Linear Trigger (linearTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Only tickets that need to be classified (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Update team (linear)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Get all linear teams (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set team ID (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Set me up (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Check if AI was able to find a team (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Notify in Slack (slack)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Merge data (merge)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the classification of bug tickets by integrating with Linear and OpenAI. It triggers when a ticket is created, filters for specific conditions, retrieves team information, uses AI to classify the ticket, and notifies the relevant team via Slack.

### Demonstrate
A software company can use this workflow to automatically assign bug tickets to the appropriate team based on the ticket's content. This speeds up response times and ensures that the right team addresses issues efficiently, enhancing overall productivity.

### Imitate
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set your Linear and OpenAI credentials.
3. Customize the Linear Trigger node to match your project.
4. Adjust the team ID in the Set Team ID node based on your teams.
5. Test the workflow with a sample bug ticket to see the AI classification and Slack notification in action.

### Practice
Create a test bug ticket in Linear, ensuring it meets the filtering criteria. Run the workflow and observe if the correct team is notified in Slack. Adjust the filtering conditions to see how it impacts the workflow's execution.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services, helping clients streamline their processes and improve response times. This can lead to more clients, higher income, and a competitive edge in the automation market.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Linear Trigger" and "OpenAI" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
