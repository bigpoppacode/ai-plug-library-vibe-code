# Using External Workflows As Tools In N8n

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving executeWorkflowTrigger, httpRequest, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Execute Workflow Trigger (executeWorkflowTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: FireCrawl (httpRequest)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Edit Fields (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of web scraping. It triggers when a URL is provided, sends a request to scrape data from that URL, processes the response to extract relevant information, and stores it in a format that can be reused by other applications.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically gather product details from a competitor’s website. By scraping data regularly, they can keep tabs on pricing and inventory, making informed decisions without manual effort.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a "Webhook Trigger" node to receive the URL.
3. Use an "HTTP Request" node to scrape the provided URL.
4. Add a "Set" node to format the scraped data.
5. Optionally, use a "Sticky Note" node to document the process for future reference.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the URL input to scrape different websites. Test it with various URLs to see how the data extraction behaves and ensure it captures the necessary information correctly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow can save you significant time and effort in data collection, allowing you to focus on analysis and strategy. It positions you to offer valuable services in market research and competitive analysis, helping you attract clients seeking to leverage data for smarter decisions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Execute Workflow Trigger" and "Sticky Note" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
