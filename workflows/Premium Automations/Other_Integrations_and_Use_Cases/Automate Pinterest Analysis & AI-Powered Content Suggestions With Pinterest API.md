### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline their social media strategy. By automating Pinterest analysis, they can save time identifying trends and generating content ideas, allowing them to focus on strategic marketing efforts.

### Imitate
1. Set up a scheduled trigger in n8n to run daily at 8 AM.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
