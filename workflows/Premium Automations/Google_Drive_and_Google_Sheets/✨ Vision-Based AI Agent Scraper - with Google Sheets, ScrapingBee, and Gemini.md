## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data extraction from web pages using a vision-based AI agent. It gathers URLs from Google Sheets, retrieves page HTML and screenshots via ScrapingBee, and processes the data through an AI model (Google Gemini) to extract structured information, which is then stored back in Google Sheets.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate product data collection from competitor websites. Instead of manually gathering product details, the workflow extracts titles, prices, and promotional info, saving time and improving data accuracy for market analysis.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and import the workflow.
2. Customize the Google Sheets node to point to your URLs.
3. Replace the ScrapingBee API key with your own.
4. Adjust the AI prompts in the Google Gemini node to fit your data extraction needs.
5. Run the workflow and check Google Sheets for the results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to scrape different types of data (like reviews or specifications) from a different website. Change the structured output parser to match the new data format and observe how the workflow handles the new input.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to provide valuable data extraction services, appealing to businesses that need competitive insights. This can lead to new clients, increased revenue, and the ability to scale your automation solutions effectively.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note14" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
