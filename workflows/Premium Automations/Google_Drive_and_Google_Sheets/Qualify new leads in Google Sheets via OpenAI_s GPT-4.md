## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of qualifying new leads from Google Sheets using OpenAI's GPT-4. It merges incoming lead data, processes it through AI for qualification, and updates the lead status back in Google Sheets, streamlining lead management.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically assess incoming leads from a form submission. Instead of manually reviewing each lead, the workflow qualifies them based on predefined criteria, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Create a Google Sheets document to collect lead data.
2. Set up a Google Sheets Trigger in n8n to check for new entries.
3. Use OpenAI's GPT-4 to evaluate each lead based on your criteria.
4. Merge the original data with the AI's response.
5. Update the lead status in Google Sheets with the qualification results.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to add a new criterion for lead qualification. For example, include a check for the lead's location or industry. Test how this affects the qualification process and observe the changes in your Google Sheets.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate lead qualification, improving efficiency and accuracy. This skill can help you attract clients seeking automation solutions, increasing your service offerings and potential income as part of an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Merge" and "Check for new entries" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
