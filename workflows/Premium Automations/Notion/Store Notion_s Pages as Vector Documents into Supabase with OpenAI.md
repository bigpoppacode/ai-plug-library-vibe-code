# Store Notion S Pages As Vector Documents Into Supabase With Openai

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving stickyNote, embeddingsOpenAi, textSplitterTokenSplitter.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Notion - Page Added Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Embeddings OpenAI (embeddingsOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Token Splitter (textSplitterTokenSplitter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Notion - Page Added Trigger (notionTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Notion - Retrieve Page Content (notion)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Filter Non-Text Content (filter)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Summarize - Concatenate Notion's blocks content (summarize)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Create metadata and load content (documentDefaultDataLoader)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Supabase Vector Store (vectorStoreSupabase)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of storing Notion pages as vector documents in a Supabase database. It triggers when a new page is added in Notion, retrieves its content, filters out non-text elements, summarizes the text, generates embeddings using OpenAI, and stores everything in Supabase.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automatically archive and analyze notes or documents from Notion, enhancing knowledge management. For instance, a consulting firm might want to extract insights from client meeting notes stored in Notion and keep them organized in a searchable database.

### Imitate
1. Create a Notion database for pages you want to track.
2. Set up an n8n workflow with a Notion trigger for new pages.
3. Use the Notion node to retrieve the content.
4. Filter out non-text content and summarize the text.
5. Generate embeddings with OpenAI and store the data in Supabase.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include additional filtering criteria, such as excluding specific keywords from the content. Test it by adding new pages in Notion with various content types and see how it affects the output stored in Supabase.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer valuable automation services to clients, enhancing their data management and retrieval processes. By providing a system that intelligently organizes and analyzes information, you position yourself as a critical partner in their operational efficiency, leading to potential income growth.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Sticky Note" and "Supabase Vector Store" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
