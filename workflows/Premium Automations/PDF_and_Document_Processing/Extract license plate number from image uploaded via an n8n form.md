## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow extracts license plate numbers from uploaded images. It uses an AI model to analyze the image and return the extracted text, which is displayed to the user in a results form.

### Demonstrate
A car rental business could use this workflow to quickly capture license plate numbers from uploaded vehicle images, speeding up the check-in process and reducing manual entry errors.

### Imitate
1. Create a new n8n workflow.
2. Add a Form Trigger node for image uploads.
3. Set up an OpenAI LLM node to analyze the image.
4. Connect a Basic LLM Chain node for processing.
5. Add a FormResultPage node to display the extracted license plate.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the prompt in the OpenRouter LLM node to extract different information from images, such as "Extract the make and model of the car."

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data extraction tasks, providing businesses with faster service and fewer errors, making you an invaluable resource in the automation space.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Basic LLM Chain" and "FromTrigger" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
