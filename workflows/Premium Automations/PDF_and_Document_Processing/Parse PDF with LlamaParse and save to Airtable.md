# Parse Pdf With Llamaparse And Save To Airtable
## 🚀 What It Does
Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use as a **glue/API broker**: receive data, enrich/validate via APIs, and pass to downstream systems.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Google Drive Trigger**.
2. **Google Drive Trigger** `googleDriveTrigger` — event: "fileCreated", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
3. **Webhook** `webhook` — method: **POST**, path: `/0f7f5ebb-8b66-453b-a818-20cc3647c783`
4. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "920", height: "400", content: "## Scenario 1

"
5. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "1340", height: "460", content: "## Scenario 2

"
6. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "270", height: "80"
7. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "170", height: "80"
8. **Sticky Note4** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "170", height: "80"
9. **Sticky Note5** `stickyNote` — color: "3", width: "530", height: "80"
10. **Sticky Note9** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "330.5152611046425", height: "239.5888196628349"
11. **Sticky Note7** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "636", height: "657"
12. **Sticky Note6** `stickyNote` — color: "7", width: "280", height: "626"
13. **Google Drive** `googleDrive` — operation: **download**
14. **Set Fields** `set` — options: "[object Object]", assignments: "[object Object]"
15. **Upload File** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `https://api.cloud.llamaindex.ai/api/parsing/upload`
16. **OpenAI - Extract Line Items** `httpRequest` — method: **POST**, url: `=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
17. **Create Invoice** `airtable` — operation: **create**, table: `[object Object]`
18. **Process Line Items** `code` — jsCode: "// Get the input from the "OpenAI - Extract Line Items" node
const input = $("OpenAI - Extract Line Items").first().json;

// Initialize an array for the output
const outputItems =…[truncated]"
19. **Create Line Item** `airtable` — operation: **create**, table: `[object Object]`

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
**Explain**  
This n8n workflow automates the process of detecting new invoice files in a Google Drive folder, extracting their line items using OpenAI's API, and storing the data in Airtable. It starts with a Google Drive Trigger that detects new files, downloads them, and uploads them to LlamaParse for parsing. The parsed results are processed to extract line items, which are then stored in Airtable as new invoice records and line item entries.

**Demonstrate**  
A business owner could use this workflow to automate their invoicing process. When a new invoice is uploaded to Google Drive, it is automatically parsed, and the data is stored in Airtable, minimizing manual data entry and reducing errors.

**Imitate**  
1. Set up a Google Drive folder and connect it to n8n.
2. Import the workflow into n8n.
3. Configure the Google Drive Trigger to monitor your invoice folder.
4. Set up API connections for LlamaParse, OpenAI, and Airtable.
5. Test the workflow with a sample invoice to ensure data is properly extracted and stored.

**Practice**  
Create a mock Google Drive folder and upload sample invoices. Run the workflow to see how invoices are processed and stored in Airtable. Modify the invoice format to test the robustness of data extraction.

**WIIFM**  
Mastering this workflow can enhance your service offerings by providing automated invoice processing to clients, saving them time and reducing errors. This capability can attract more clients and generate additional income streams for your AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** googleDriveOAuth2Api, airtableTokenApi, openAiApi.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
3. **API Contracts:** Validate required headers and 2xx/4xx handling; add retries for 429/5xx.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
