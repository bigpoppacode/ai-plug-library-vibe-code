# Prepare Csv Files With Gpt 4prepare Csv Files With Gpt 4

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, openAi, splitInBatches.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: OpenAI (openAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Split In Batches (splitInBatches)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Parse JSON (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Make JSON Table (itemLists)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Convert to CSV (spreadsheetFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Save to Disk (writeBinaryFile)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Strip UTF BOM bytes (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Create valid binary (moveBinaryData)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the creation of CSV files containing random user data generated by OpenAI's GPT-4. It processes the data in batches, converts it to CSV format, and saves it to disk while ensuring the output is clean and usable.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to generate mock user data for testing a new application or marketing campaign. Instead of manually creating sample data, they can automate the process, saving time and ensuring consistency.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node to start the process.
3. Add an OpenAI node to generate random user data.
4. Use the Split In Batches node to handle multiple entries.
5. Parse the JSON output with a Set node.
6. Create a JSON table, convert it to CSV, and save it to disk.
7. Test the workflow by executing it and checking the output files.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the OpenAI node to generate different types of data, such as product information or customer reviews. Execute the workflow and examine how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data generation, which can be a valuable service for clients needing mock data for testing or analysis. This skill can help you create more efficient processes, attract clients, and ultimately increase your income as an automation consultant.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "Sticky Note1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
