## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of extracting text from PDFs and images, categorizing the data, and converting it into CSV format for easy storage and analysis, all while utilizing AI models for enhanced accuracy.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the extraction of transaction data from bank statements stored as PDFs or images, saving time and reducing manual data entry while ensuring accurate record-keeping.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Google Drive folder to store PDFs/images.
2. Create an n8n workflow with a Google Drive Trigger for file uploads.
3. Add a Switch node to route files based on type (PDF or image).
4. Use the respective nodes to download and extract text.
5. Send extracted data to an AI model for categorization, then convert it to CSV and upload it back to Google Drive.

### Practice
Try uploading a sample PDF or image with transaction data to your Google Drive folder, then run the workflow to see how it extracts and categorizes the data into CSV format. Adjust the AI prompt to refine categorization results.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services, helping businesses save time and reduce errors in data processing, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and potentially increasing your income through consulting or service offerings.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Google Gemini Chat Model" and "Vertex A.I. extract text" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
