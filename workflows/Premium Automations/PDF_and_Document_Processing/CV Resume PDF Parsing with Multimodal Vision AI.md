## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of evaluating a candidate's resume. It starts when triggered manually, downloads the resume from Google Drive, converts it from PDF to an image, and uses an AI model to analyze if the candidate is qualified for a role.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline the hiring process. Instead of manually reviewing resumes, they can automate the evaluation, saving time and ensuring consistency in candidate assessments.

### Imitate
1. Set up a manual trigger in n8n.
2. Add a Google Drive node to download resumes.
3. Use an HTTP request node to convert PDFs to images.
4. Implement an AI model to analyze qualifications.
5. Connect results to a notification system to alert hiring managers.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to evaluate a different document type (e.g., cover letters). Change the image conversion step to accommodate the new format and adjust the AI model's prompt accordingly.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to offer automated hiring solutions, enhancing efficiency for clients. By providing streamlined recruitment processes, you can attract more customers and potentially increase your income through automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Sticky Note4" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
