## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the job application process. It extracts information from uploaded CVs, evaluates them using AI, stores data in Airtable, and sends follow-up emails to applicants, streamlining hiring.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate job applications, reducing manual CV reviews and speeding up candidate responses. It improves HR efficiency and enhances the applicant experience by providing timely updates.

### Imitate
1. Set up a form for CV uploads using n8n.
2. Use the Extract from File node to pull data from uploaded PDFs.
3. Implement AI models to evaluate CVs.
4. Store the extracted data in Airtable.
5. Automate email notifications for applicants.

### Practice
Try creating a simplified version of this workflow. Set up a form to collect CVs, extract text from one uploaded PDF, and send a confirmation email to the applicant. Test the workflow with dummy data.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services, attracting clients in HR and recruitment. It saves businesses time and resources, positioning you as a go-to expert in AI-driven automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Extract from File" and "Submission Success" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
