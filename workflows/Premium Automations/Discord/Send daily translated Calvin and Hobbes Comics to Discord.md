A business owner could use this workflow to engage followers on social media by sharing daily comic strips, enhancing community interaction, and driving traffic to their social platforms while automating the posting process.

### Imitate
1. Set up a **Schedule Trigger** to run daily at a specific time.
2. Use an **HTTP Request** node to fetch comic data from a website.
3. Add an **Information Extractor** to retrieve the comic image URL.
4. Utilize **OpenAI** to translate comic dialogues.
5. Post the comic and translations to Discord using the **Discord** node.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
