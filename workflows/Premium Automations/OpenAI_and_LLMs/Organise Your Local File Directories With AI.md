Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **Local File Trigger** node.
2. **Step 1: Local File Trigger (localFileTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Get Files and Folders (executeCommand)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Files and Folders to Array (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Mistral Cloud Chat Model (lmChatMistralCloud)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Set Variables (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Move Files into Folders (executeCommand)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: If Has Target Files... (if)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
13. **Step 12: Get Suggestions to List (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
15. **Step 14: Sticky Note4 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
16. **Step 15: Sticky Note5 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
17. **Step 16: AI File Manager (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates file organization. It triggers when files are added to a specified folder, retrieves file and folder data, uses AI to suggest how to categorize files, and moves them into designated folders based on those suggestions.

### Demonstrate
A business owner managing a large number of files can use this workflow to automatically sort documents into specific folders. This saves time, reduces clutter, and ensures files are easy to find, enhancing productivity and organization.

### Imitate
1. Set up a Local File Trigger to monitor your desired folder.
2. Use Execute Command to list files and folders.
3. Convert the output into arrays for files and folders.
4. Integrate AI (Mistral) to categorize files based on their names.
5. Move files into appropriate folders using Execute Command.
6. Test the workflow to ensure proper functioning.

### Practice
Create a new n8n workflow that triggers on a file addition. Use a simple command to list files and manually categorize them into folders. Experiment with moving files to understand how the organization process works before implementing AI integration.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables students to offer valuable automation services, helping businesses save time and improve efficiency. This skill can attract clients seeking to streamline operations, leading to potential income growth in an AI automation business.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "Local File Trigger" and "AI File Manager" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
