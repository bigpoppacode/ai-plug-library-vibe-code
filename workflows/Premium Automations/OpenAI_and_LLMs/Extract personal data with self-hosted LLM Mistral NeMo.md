13. **Step 12: Sticky Note6 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
14. **Step 13: Sticky Note7 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates data extraction from chat messages using a self-hosted language model. When a chat message is received, it processes the message through various steps, such as parsing and validating the output, to generate structured data for further use.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate customer inquiries. For instance, when a customer messages about their order, the workflow extracts relevant details like name, contact method, and subject, streamlining follow-up processes.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Chat Trigger** node to receive chat messages.
3. Use the **Ollama Chat Model** node for processing the message.
4. Add **Output Parser** nodes to ensure the response is structured and valid.
5. Save the output in a format you can use later (e.g., Google Sheets).

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to incorporate a new output format. For example, change the JSON schema to include additional fields like "order status" or "feedback," and test it with different chat inputs to see how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to automate data extraction tasks, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in customer interactions. This can help you attract more clients by offering automation solutions, ultimately leading to increased revenue as a service provider.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "Sticky Note7" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
