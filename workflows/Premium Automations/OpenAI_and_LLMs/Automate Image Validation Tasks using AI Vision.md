# Automate Image Validation Tasks Using AI Vision

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, outputParserStructured, set.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking ‘Test workflow’** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking ‘Test workflow’ (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Photo URLs (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Photos To List (splitOut)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Download Photos (googleDrive)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Resize For AI (editImage)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: Passport Photo Validator (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: Google Gemini Chat Model (lmChatGoogleGemini)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of validating passport photos. It starts with a manual trigger, processes photo URLs, downloads and resizes the images, checks their validity using AI, and finally outputs the results, ensuring compliance with passport photo guidelines.

### Demonstrate
A business owner might use this workflow to streamline passport photo validation for customers applying for visas or ID cards, reducing manual review time, ensuring compliance, and enhancing customer service by providing immediate feedback.

### Imitate
1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a Manual Trigger node.
3. Use Set node to input photo URLs.
4. Implement Google Drive node to download images.
5. Add Edit Image node to resize photos.
6. Use AI model node to validate images.
7. Connect results to an output node for feedback.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to validate profile pictures for a social media platform. Change the validation criteria and adjust the output to fit user requirements, ensuring to test different image formats for compatibility.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer passport photo validation as a service, saving businesses time and ensuring compliance. This skill can attract customers needing automation in personal identification processes, thus generating income in AI automation services.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking ‘Test workflow’" and "Google Gemini Chat Model" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
