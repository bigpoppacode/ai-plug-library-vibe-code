## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of handling job applications. When a form is submitted, it extracts information from the uploaded CV, analyzes qualifications, and stores the results in Google Sheets while providing feedback on the candidate.

### Demonstrate
A business owner can use this workflow to streamline hiring. Instead of manually reviewing CVs, the automation extracts key information and evaluates candidates against job criteria, saving time and ensuring consistency in the hiring process.

### Imitate
1. **Set Up Form**: Create a form for CV submissions.
2. **Add Nodes**: Include nodes for file extraction, information extraction, and Google Sheets integration.
3. **Configure AI Evaluations**: Set up OpenAI nodes to analyze qualifications and generate feedback.
4. **Test Workflow**: Run the workflow with sample data to ensure it functions correctly.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow by changing the criteria for candidate evaluation. For example, adjust the educational qualifications required and see how the workflow processes different CVs.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow allows you to offer valuable automation services to businesses, enhancing their hiring efficiency, reducing manual workload, and ultimately generating income by positioning yourself as a consultant in AI-driven automation solutions.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "On form submission" and "Sticky Note5" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
