# Force AI To Use A Specific Output Format

## 🚀 What It Does
This workflow automates a process involving manualTrigger, set, chainLlm.

## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Trigger:** This workflow starts with a **When clicking "Execute Workflow"** node.
2. **Step 1: When clicking "Execute Workflow" (manualTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Prompt (set)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: LLM Chain (chainLlm)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
5. **Step 4: Structured Output Parser (outputParserStructured)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
6. **Step 5: Auto-fixing Output Parser (outputParserAutofixing)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
7. **Step 6: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
8. **Step 7: Sticky Note1 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
9. **Step 8: Sticky Note2 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
10. **Step 9: Sticky Note3 (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
11. **Step 10: OpenAI Chat Model (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
12. **Step 11: OpenAI Chat Model1 (lmChatOpenAi)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow automates the process of fetching data, processing it with AI, and parsing the output into a structured format. It involves manual execution, prompting for input, and using AI models to generate and validate responses.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow to automate the collection of state data and their largest cities, enhancing data accuracy and saving time. For example, generating a report for a geographic study without manual research.

### Imitate
1. Open n8n and create a new workflow.
2. Add a **Manual Trigger** node.
3. Insert a **Set** node to define the prompt (e.g., "List the largest states in the USA").
4. Connect to an **LLM Chain** node to process the input.
5. Use **Output Parsers** to format the response.
6. Add **OpenAI Chat Model** nodes to refine the output.
7. Execute the workflow and review results.

### Practice
Try modifying the prompt in the **Set** node to ask for different data, such as "List the top tourist attractions in the USA." Execute the workflow and observe how the output changes.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow enables you to create automated data collection and processing systems, making you valuable to clients seeking efficiency. This expertise can lead to high-ticket service offerings in AI automation, boosting your income potential.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When clicking "Execute Workflow"" and "OpenAI Chat Model1" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
