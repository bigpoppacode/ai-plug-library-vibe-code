## 💼 Business Use Case
Use it to automate research, content creation, or data analysis. It saves hours of manual work.

## ⚙️ How It Works

2. **Step 1: When chat message received (chatTrigger)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
3. **Step 2: Ollama Chat Model (lmChatOllama)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.
4. **Step 3: Sticky Note (stickyNote)** - This step performs a key action in the workflow.

## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
### Explain
This n8n workflow allows users to chat with local Large Language Models (LLMs) using a simple interface. When a chat message is received, it sends the input to the Ollama Chat Model, which processes the message and returns a response, creating an interactive chat experience.

### Demonstrate
A business owner could use this workflow for customer support. When customers message via chat, the workflow automatically sends their queries to an LLM, which generates helpful responses, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction without needing a human for every inquiry.

### Imitate
1. Set up n8n and install Ollama.
2. Create a new workflow with a "When chat message received" trigger.
3. Add the "Ollama Chat Model" node to process chat input.
4. Connect a "Sticky Note" to document the workflow.
5. Implement a "Chat LLM Chain" to return responses to the chat interface.

### Practice
Try modifying the workflow to include a specific FAQ. Add a condition that checks if the chat message contains certain keywords and return predefined responses for those queries, enhancing the workflow's functionality.

### WIIFM
Mastering this workflow positions you to offer automation services that enhance customer interaction and operational efficiency. By leveraging AI, you can attract clients seeking to streamline their processes, creating opportunities for income through automation consulting.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. **Connect Credentials:** OpenAI, Google Sheets, Slack, and other nodes must be authenticated.
2. **Customize Core Logic:** Review "When chat message received" and "Chat LLM Chain" for IDs, table names, and URLs.
3. **Activate the Workflow:** Set the workflow to "Active" after testing.

### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
