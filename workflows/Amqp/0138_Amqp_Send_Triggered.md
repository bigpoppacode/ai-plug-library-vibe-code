# Amqp Send Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using amqpTrigger.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Use to eliminate manual copy-paste and standardize a recurring business process.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **AMQP Trigger**.
  2. **AMQP Trigger** `amqpTrigger` — sink: ""
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to receive messages from an ActiveMQ queue using the AMQP protocol. It starts with an AMQP Trigger node, which listens for incoming messages in the queue. When a message is received, it activates the workflow, allowing for further processing or actions based on the content of the message.

**Demonstrate:**  
A logistics company could use this workflow to automate updates to their inventory system. Whenever a new shipment arrives and is logged in their system, an ActiveMQ message is sent to the queue. This workflow then triggers a process to update inventory records and notify the warehouse team.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into n8n.
2. Set up your ActiveMQ credentials in the AMQP Trigger node.
3. Define the queue you want to listen to.
4. Test the workflow by sending a test message to the queue.
5. Add additional nodes to process the data as needed.

**Practice:**  
Set up a simple test environment with ActiveMQ and send a message to a queue. Use the AMQP Trigger node in n8n to capture the message and log it to a file or send a notification, ensuring you understand the trigger process.

**WIIFM (What's In It For Me):**  
Mastering this workflow allows you to create real-time, event-driven automations that can handle high volumes of data efficiently. This expertise can be leveraged to offer advanced automation solutions to clients, enhancing your service offerings and potentially increasing your income in the automation business.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** amqp.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
