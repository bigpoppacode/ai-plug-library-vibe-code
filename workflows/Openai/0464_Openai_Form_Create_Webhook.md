# Openai Form Create Webhook
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Automates a flow using set×2, openAi, respondToWebhook.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Great for **content, summarization, triage, or decisioning** where AI adds speed and consistency.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **n8n Form Trigger**.
  2. **n8n Form Trigger** `formTrigger` — path: `/c61492e5-73ce-40d4-b758-d5f09da0fb6c`
3. **Edit Fields** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
4. **Create input to open ai** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", options: "[object Object]"
5. **OpenAI** `openAi` — resource: **chat**, prompt: "[object Object]"
6. **Respond to Webhook** `respondToWebhook` — options: "[object Object]", respondWith: "text", responseBody: "=<!DOCTYPE html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Mark…[truncated]"
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  **Explain:**  
This n8n workflow is designed to automate the process of documenting other workflows. It begins with a form trigger that collects the workflow title and JSON data. The data is then prepared and sent to OpenAI, which generates concise documentation. Finally, the documentation is formatted into HTML and returned as a response, providing users with a neatly formatted document of their workflow.

**Demonstrate:**  
A software consultant could use this workflow to quickly generate documentation for client workflows, saving time and ensuring consistency across projects.

**Imitate:**  
1. Import the workflow into your n8n instance.
2. Set up the form trigger to collect workflow details.
3. Connect your OpenAI account for API access.
4. Customize the HTML response for your needs.
5. Test the workflow with a sample workflow JSON.

**Practice:**  
Create a simple workflow JSON and use this documentation workflow to generate its documentation. Experiment with modifying the HTML template to fit different styles.

**WIIFM:**  
Mastering this workflow enables you to efficiently document workflows, a valuable service in automation consulting. This can enhance client deliverables, improve client satisfaction, and increase potential income by offering comprehensive documentation services.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** openAiApi.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
