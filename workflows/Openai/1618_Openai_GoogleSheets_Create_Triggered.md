# Openai GoogleSheets Create Triggered
  ## 🚀 What It Does
  Moves data between apps and a **database/spreadsheet**, with logic and optional AI steps.
  
  ## 💼 Business Use Case
  Ideal for **lead intake**, **enrichment**, and **CRM updates** with alerts to the right channel.
  
  ## ⚙️ How It Works
  1. **Trigger:** This workflow starts with **Check for new entries**.
  2. **Sticky Note** `stickyNote` — width: "442", height: "360.6357827476038", content: "### 1. Create a Google Sheet document
* This template uses Google Sheet document connected to Google Forms, but a standalone Sheet document will work too
* Adapt initial trigger to…[truncated]"
3. **Sticky Note1** `stickyNote` — width: "471", height: "322", content: "### 2. Provide lead qualification instructions
* Create a __system message__ with overall instructions
* Add a __user message__ with the JSON variables
* Set node parses the result…[truncated]"
4. **Sticky Note2** `stickyNote` — width: "355", height: "269.81214057507987", content: "### 3. Combine the initial data with GPT response
* This Merge node puts together original records from the google sheet and responses from the OpenAI"
5. **Sticky Note3** `stickyNote` — width: "398", height: "265", content: "### 4. Update the Google Sheet document
* Provide __Column to Match On__ (usually a timestamp in case of Google Forms)
* Enter the result from GPT into a separate column"
6. **Check for new entries** `googleSheetsTrigger` — event: "rowAdded", options: "[object Object]", pollTimes: "[object Object]"
7. **Qualify leads with GPT** `openAi` — resource: **chat**, prompt: "[object Object]"
8. **Extract JSON reply** `set` — fields: "[object Object]", include: "selected", options: "[object Object]"
9. **Merge** `merge` — mode: "combine", options: "[object Object]", combinationMode: "mergeByPosition"
10. **Update lead status** `googleSheets` — operation: **update**
  
  ## 💡 AI-Powered Ideas for Improvement
  - **Explain**: This workflow automates lead qualification using Google Sheets and OpenAI's GPT. It monitors a Google Sheet for new entries, sends the lead data to GPT for assessment based on specific criteria (e.g., decision-makers, email domain), and updates the sheet with the qualification status.

- **Demonstrate**: A business owner can use this workflow to automatically qualify leads from a Google Form, ensuring only high-quality leads are forwarded to the sales team, saving time and improving conversion rates.

- **Imitate**: Import the workflow into n8n. Connect your Google Sheets and OpenAI accounts. Set up the Google Sheets trigger to check for new entries. Customize the GPT prompt for your lead criteria. Test by adding a new entry in Google Sheets and check the updated qualification status.

- **Practice**: Create a test Google Sheet with sample leads. Run the workflow to see how it qualifies each lead. Adjust the criteria in the GPT prompt and observe how the changes affect lead qualification.

- **WIIFM**: Mastering this workflow allows you to offer automated lead qualification services, enhancing client sales processes and increasing your value as an AI automation consultant. This could lead to new clients and higher income opportunities.
  
  ## 🔧 Setup Instructions
  1. **Connect Credentials:** googleSheetsOAuth2Api, openAiApi, googleSheetsTriggerOAuth2Api.
2. **Data Mapping:** Verify base/sheet IDs and column names match exactly to prevent silent failures.
  
### ⚠️ Automation Ain’t the Same Anymore

Most builders out here are stuck doing $500 workflows and calling it a win.  
That’s not the move.  

I'm closing $6k–$13k deals by stacking simple automations with lightweight AI...  
and it takes me under 2 hours to build most of them.

#### 🧠 Examples From My Own Playbook:
- 🔁 Turned a recurring invoice workflow into a $6,000 retainer that saved 20 hours/week  
- ⚖️ Built an AI-powered lead gen engine for law firms — they paid $13,000 happily  
- 🚀 Launched an SEO agent that outperforms funded companies — using free OpenAI credits
