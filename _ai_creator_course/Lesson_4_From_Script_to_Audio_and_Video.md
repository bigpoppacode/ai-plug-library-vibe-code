## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Transform ChatGPT scripts into professional-quality audio with ElevenLabs.

## Part 1: Explain

Once you have a script, the next step is **production**.  
Traditionally, this requires expensive gear, editing skills, and time.  

AI tools eliminate these barriers:  
- **ElevenLabs** generates realistic voiceovers.  
- **Pictory** creates professional videos from text and audio.  

The result: you can go from **script → audio → video** in less than an hour.

## Part 2: Demonstrate

**Step 1: ElevenLabs for Voiceover**  
1. Copy your script.  
2. Paste it into ElevenLabs.  
3. Select a voice profile (choose from library or clone your own).  
4. Adjust tone, speed, and emotion.  
5. Export as MP3.  

**Step 2: Pictory for Video**  
1. Start a new project in Pictory.  
2. Import your script (or audio).  
3. Pictory auto-generates scenes, stock footage, and captions.  
4. Customize visuals, add branding, and sync with your ElevenLabs audio.  
5. Export two versions:  
   - **With subtitles** for YouTube/LinkedIn.  
   - **Without subtitles** for clipping into shorts later.

## Part 3: Imitate

Try this workflow with a 200-word script from Lesson 3:  
- Use ElevenLabs to create 2 different voiceovers (calm vs. energetic).  
- Import into Pictory.  
- Export a finished video in under 30 minutes.  

---

## Part 4: Practice

1. **Audio Variations**  
   Prompt:  
   ```
   Record 2 versions of your voiceover:  
   - Calm & explanatory.  
   - Upbeat & motivational.  
   Compare how the vibe changes the content.  
   ```

2. **Brand Customization**  
   Upload your logo, brand colors, and fonts into Pictory.  
   Export a video that looks unique to your brand.  

3. **Deliverable Drill**  
   By the end of this lesson, you should have:  
   - 1 polished long-form video (3–5 minutes).  
   - 1 subtitled version.  
   - 1 clean version without subtitles.

## Analogies That Help

- **AI = Studio Crew:** ElevenLabs is your voice actor, Pictory is your editor, stock footage provider, and captioning team.  
- **Cooking Show:** Script = recipe, audio = narration, video = plating the dish.  
- **Fast Fashion for Content:** Rapidly produce, test, and iterate.

## Exercises

- Take a script from Lesson 3 and create 2 videos with different tones.  
- Export both subtitled and non-subtitled versions.  
- Upload to YouTube (private if needed) to test workflow.  

---

## Key Takeaways

- ElevenLabs converts scripts into **studio-quality voiceovers**.  
- Pictory turns scripts + audio into **polished videos** with no editing skills.  
- Producing 2 versions (subtitled + non-subtitled) sets up your workflow for repurposing.  
- By now, you should have your **first long-form video**, ready to fuel the rest of the Content Play.
