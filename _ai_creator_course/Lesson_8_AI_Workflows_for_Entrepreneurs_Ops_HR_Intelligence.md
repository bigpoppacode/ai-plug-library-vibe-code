## Part 1: Explain

AI doesn’t just help with content and sales — it transforms **back-office functions** too.  
Operations, HR, and market intelligence can all be streamlined with AI workflows.

**Opportunities in Ops, HR, and Intelligence:**  
- **Operations:** Automate reporting, invoicing, and scheduling.  
- **HR:** Speed up candidate sourcing, resume screening, and onboarding.  
- **Competitive Intelligence:** Monitor competitors, pricing, and industry trends.

## Part 2: Demonstrate

**Example 1 – Operations Automation**  
- Use Zapier + AI to auto-generate weekly performance reports.  
- Example: “Summarize this sales spreadsheet into 5 insights and 3 recommendations.”  

**Example 2 – HR Automation**  
- Use ChatGPT to screen resumes against job descriptions.  
- Prompt:  
  ```
  Compare this resume to this job description. Score fit from 1–10 and highlight strengths and weaknesses.
  ```  
- Automate onboarding: Chatbots walk new hires through FAQs, benefits, and company tools.  

**Example 3 – Competitive Intelligence**  
- Tools like **Crayon** track competitor website changes, campaigns, and pricing.  
- AI summarizes weekly competitor activity into digestible bullet points.  
- Prompt ChatGPT:  
  ```
  Summarize the key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of [competitor]. Return as a SWOT table.
  ```

## Part 3: Imitate

Design one back-office workflow with AI:  
- Choose **Ops**, **HR**, or **Intelligence**.  
- Example: Automate your invoices with a template generator, or use ChatGPT to summarize 10 competitor websites.  

---

## Part 4: Practice

1. **Ops Drill**  
   Automate one reporting task this week (e.g., weekly sales summary).  

2. **HR Drill**  
   Collect 5 resumes and test ChatGPT’s ability to rank them.  

3. **Intelligence Drill**  
   Track 2 competitors for one week. Summarize differences in offers or marketing.  

---

## Analogies That Help

- **Back-Office Robot:** AI as the assistant that manages routine paperwork and admin.  
- **HR Recruiter on Demand:** AI filters candidates 24/7.  
- **Radar System:** Competitive intelligence = your early warning system.  

---

## Exercises

- Create one AI workflow in ops (reports, invoicing, or scheduling).  
- Build a resume-screening prompt and test it.  
- Summarize 1 competitor’s strengths/weaknesses using AI.
