## Part 1: Explain

Creating content is only half the battle. The other half is **consistent distribution**.  
Without automation, you waste hours manually posting and risk missing optimal posting times.  

**Metricool** solves this by:  
- Scheduling content across multiple platforms.  
- Automating publishing.  
- Tracking performance analytics.  

The goal: **spend less time posting, more time creating and analyzing results.**

## Part 2: Demonstrate

**Step 1: Connect Platforms**  
- Link Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, and more.  

**Step 2: Upload Content**  
- Import your long-form video + shorts from Lessons 4 and 5.  
- Add captions, hashtags, and platform-specific tweaks.  

**Step 3: Build a Calendar**  
- Schedule posts for the week.  
- Example cadence:  
  - Mon: Long-form video (YouTube + LinkedIn).  
  - Tue–Sat: 1–2 Shorts daily (IG Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikTok).  

**Step 4: Review Analytics**  
- After posts go live, check reach, engagement, and growth.  
- Double down on what works, cut what doesn’t.

## Part 3: Imitate

Create your own schedule in Metricool:  
- Upload 1 long-form video.  
- Upload 5 shorts.  
- Schedule across 3 platforms.  
- Total: At least 6 posts for the week.

## Part 4: Practice

1. **Calendar Drill**  
   Design a content calendar with at least 6 posts this week.  

2. **Platform Optimization**  
   Prompt ChatGPT:  
   ```
   Rewrite this caption for Instagram (casual tone).  
   Rewrite this caption for LinkedIn (professional tone).  
   ```

3. **Analytics Check**  
   At the end of the week, compare performance across platforms.  
   Ask: Which clips drove the most engagement?
