## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Use Opus Clip (Opus Pro) to turn long-form videos into short clips.  
- Identify strong “hooks” that capture attention in the first 3 seconds.  
- Format content correctly for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.  
- Deliver at least 5 short clips from a single long-form video.

## Part 1: Explain

Attention spans are shrinking. Short-form content dominates platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts.  
The secret to scale is **repurposing**: slicing your long-form video into multiple short, high-impact clips.  

**Opus Clip (Opus Pro)** makes this easy:  
- Upload your long-form video.  
- The AI finds highlights with strong hooks.  
- It outputs ready-to-publish vertical clips with captions.

## Part 2: Demonstrate

**Step 1: Upload Video**  
- Take the clean, non-subtitled video from Lesson 4.  
- Upload into Opus Clip.  

**Step 2: Let AI Work**  
- The platform automatically scans for engaging segments.  
- It generates 15–60 second clips with auto-captions.  

**Step 3: Review & Edit**  
- Adjust where each clip starts and ends.  
- Polish captions for accuracy.  
- Export 5–10 finished clips.

## Part 3: Imitate

Practice with your Lesson 4 video:  
- Upload to Opus Clip.  
- Generate at least 5 short clips.  
- Ensure each one starts with a strong hook (question, bold statement, or surprising fact).

## Part 4: Practice

1. **Hook Analysis**  
   Watch 5 TikToks or Reels in your niche. Write down their first 3 seconds.  
   Ask: What made them attention-grabbing?  

2. **Short-Form Drill**  
   Prompt ChatGPT:  
   ```
   Rewrite my 3-minute video script into 5 TikTok hooks (under 15 words each).
   ```

3. **Clipping Deliverable**  
   From your Lesson 4 long-form video, export:  
   - 5–10 vertical clips.  
   - Each with captions.  
   - Each under 60 seconds.

## Analogies That Help

- **Movie Trailers:** Just like trailers sell the movie, shorts sell your long-form video.  
- **Fishing Hooks:** The first 3 seconds = the bait. If it’s weak, no one bites.  
- **Highlight Reels:** Instead of the whole game, you show the best plays.  

---

## Exercises

- Upload your Lesson 4 video into Opus Clip and generate 5 clips.  
- Test 3 different hooks with ChatGPT for one of your clips.  
- Post 1 clip on TikTok or IG and measure engagement.

## Key Takeaways

- Short-form = maximum reach and virality.  
- Opus Clip automates highlight detection and captions.  
- The first **3 seconds** determine if people keep watching.  
- From 1 long-form video, you can create **5–10 Shorts**, multiplying your impact.
