# 📘 01 – Foundations of Automation

## 🚀 What is n8n?

n8n is an **open-source, low-code automation platform**.
Think of it as **Zapier you own**: you can host it yourself, extend it with code, and connect it to almost any app or API.

* **Open-Source Tool** – no vendor lock-in
* **Visual Editor** – drag-and-drop workflows, no coding required
* **Integrations** – 300+ built-in apps + unlimited APIs

> **Analogy:** If Zapier is like renting a car, n8n is like owning one. You decide how far it goes, how it’s modified, and you’re never stuck with mileage limits.

## 💡 Why Businesses Should Care

For a **business owner**, n8n is a **digital employee**.
For a **consultant**, n8n is a **recurring revenue engine**.

### Key Benefits

* **Efficiency:** Automate repetitive work.
* **Scalability:** Handle 10x more customers with the same team.
* **Cost Savings:** Replace multiple SaaS subscriptions.
* **Improved Customer Experience:** Faster responses, fewer errors.

> **Consultant Note:** Always sell *time saved* and *opportunity gained*. Don’t just pitch “automation” — pitch the **freedom to scale without more payroll**.

## 🏗️ Hosting Options

n8n can run **in the cloud** or **on your own server**.

| Option        | Pros                                       | Cons                               | Best For                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Cloud**     | Easy setup, no maintenance, always on      | Ongoing subscription, less control | Founders, MVPs, quick pilots |
| **Self-Host** | Full control, cheaper long-term, data safe | Requires server skills             | Agencies, enterprises, gov   |

**How to Choose:**

## 🧩 Core n8n Concepts

* **Workflows** = Recipes (the overall automation)
* **Nodes** = Ingredients (each step)
* **Executions** = Completed meals (runs of the workflow)

**Visual Description:**
Imagine a flowchart:

1. A trigger starts the process.
2. Actions and transformations process data.
3. Logic branches decide paths.
4. The result is saved, sent, or reported.

## ✅ Quickstart Exercise (Hands-On)

Let’s get our first workflow live in under 5 minutes.

1. **Create Workflow** → Add a **Manual Trigger Node**.
2. Add an **Email Node** (use Gmail or SMTP).
3. Configure:

   * To: `your-email@example.com`
   * Subject: `Hello from n8n!`
   * Body: `This is your first automation.`
4. Execute Workflow.

🎉 If you get an email — congrats, you just automated your first task.
