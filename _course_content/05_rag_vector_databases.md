# 📘 05 – RAG & Vector Databases

## 🚀 Why This Matters

AI agents are powerful, but they often “hallucinate.” They make up answers because they only rely on their training data.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** fixes this by grounding AI in your **own data**. Combined with **vector databases**, RAG makes AI workflows reliable, context-aware, and business-specific.

> **Consultant Note:** When you sell RAG to a client, you’re not just automating — you’re giving them a *knowledge-enabled AI system*.

## 🧩 What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation** = two-step process:

1. **Retrieve** → Find relevant documents from a knowledge base.
2. **Generate** → Feed that context into AI to produce accurate responses.

**Example:**

* Without RAG: AI may give a random refund policy.
* With RAG: AI searches your company’s refund docs, then answers with the exact policy.

---

## 🧩 What are Vector Databases?

A **vector database** stores data in a mathematical format called **embeddings**.

* Text is turned into numbers (vectors).
* Similar meanings are close together in vector space.
* Enables **semantic search** (finds meaning, not just keywords).

**Popular Vector DBs:** Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus.

## 📂 Workflow Example – RAG-Powered Support Bot

**Visual Flow (described):**

```
Webhook Trigger → Query Vector DB → AI Agent Node → Return Answer
```

---

### Step 1: Prepare Knowledge Base

* Collect FAQs, policies, product docs.
* Use OpenAI Embeddings API (or similar) to convert text → vectors.
* Store vectors in Pinecone/Weaviate with metadata.

---

### Step 2: Create n8n Workflow

1. **Trigger Node** → Webhook.

   * Accepts customer question.

2. **HTTP Request Node** → Query Vector DB.

   * Example (Pinecone):

   ```json
   POST https://your-index.pinecone.io/query
   {
     "vector": [0.12, 0.98, -0.45, ...],
     "topK": 3,
     "includeMetadata": true
   }
   ```

3. **AI Agent Node** → OpenAI GPT.

   * Prompt Example:

   ```text
   You are a support assistant. 
   Use the provided documents to answer factually. 
   If unsure, say “I don’t know.” 

   Documents: {{$json.documents}}
   Question: {{$json.question}}
   ```

4. **Respond to User** → Return final AI answer.

---

### Example Input → Output

**Customer Input:**

> “What’s the refund policy for Product X?”

**AI Workflow Output:**

> “Refunds are available within 30 days of purchase for Product X, according to our company policy.”

---

## 🎯 Business Use Cases

* **Customer Support** – Answer product or policy questions.
* **Internal Knowledge Assistant** – Employees ask about SOPs or training docs.
* **Content Creation** – AI generates blogs/articles but grounded in your brand’s data.
* **Data Analysis** – AI summarizes company reports using real documents.

---

## 💡 Consultant Notes

* **Value Prop:** “We’ll stop your AI from guessing and make it answer with your actual business data.”
* **Upsell Path:** Start with a small FAQ bot, expand into **full knowledge systems** for sales, HR, compliance.
* **Recurring Revenue Angle:** Charge for data updates, monitoring, and maintaining the vector database.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* **RAG** makes AI accurate and context-aware.
* **Vector Databases** enable semantic search, not just keyword lookups.
* Workflows combine **Webhook → Vector DB → AI Agent**.
* Clients see this as a **knowledge-enabled AI employee**.
