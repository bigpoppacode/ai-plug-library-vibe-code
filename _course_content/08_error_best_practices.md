# 📘 08 – Error Handling & Best Practices

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Automations are only valuable if they’re **reliable**. If a workflow breaks silently, it can cost money, reputation, or both.

n8n gives you tools for **error handling** and **workflow management** so your automations run like a professional-grade system.

> **Consultant Note:** Clients don’t just pay for “a workflow that works” — they pay for **peace of mind** that it will keep working. Build error handling into every automation to position yourself as a professional, not a tinkerer.

## 🧩 Error Workflows

### 1. Default Error Path

Every node has a **red error path** that you can use to handle failures.

* Example: If an API call fails, send a Slack alert instead of letting the workflow stop.

**Visual Flow (described):**

```
HTTP Request Node → Error Path → Slack Notification
```

---

### 2. Global Error Workflow

* n8n allows you to set up a **catch-all error workflow**.
* Whenever any workflow fails, this error workflow is triggered.
* Example: Log errors to Airtable + notify admin via email.

---

### 3. Retry & Failover

* Configure **retry logic** for unstable APIs.
* Use **conditional logic** to fall back to a backup service.

**Example:**

* If SendGrid fails → use Gmail SMTP instead.

## 📂 Workflow Example – API Call with Error Handling

**Visual Flow (described):**

```
Schedule Trigger → HTTP Request → IF Node (Success?) → Airtable / Slack Error
```

### Step 1: Trigger

* Schedule Trigger → Run hourly.

### Step 2: HTTP Request Node

* Call external API.

### Step 3: IF Node

* If status = 200 → Process normally.
* Else → Send Slack notification + log error to Airtable.

## 🧩 Best Practices

### 1. Organize Workflows

* Name nodes clearly.
* Use folders or naming conventions (e.g., “ClientName – WorkflowName”).

### 2. Use Sub-Workflows

* Break large automations into smaller, reusable workflows.
* Example: “Send Email Notification” workflow called by multiple other workflows.

### 3. Secure Your Data

* Store API keys in **environment variables**, not directly in nodes.
* Use secrets management when self-hosting.

### 4. Monitor Executions

* Enable logs and alerts.
* Periodically review workflow runs for failures.

### 5. Optimize for Scale

* Avoid unnecessary nodes.
* Use batching where possible.
* Test with sample data before production.

## 🎯 Consultant Notes

* **Sell Stability:** Don’t just deliver a workflow — deliver **confidence that it won’t break**.
* **Frame Monitoring as a Service:** Offer monthly monitoring + error recovery as part of a retainer.
* **Professionalism Wins:** Position your workflows as **enterprise-grade automations** by emphasizing reliability, not just cleverness.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Always build **error paths** into workflows.
* Use a **global error workflow** to catch failures.
* Secure, monitor, and document everything.
* Reliability is a **business differentiator** for consultants.
