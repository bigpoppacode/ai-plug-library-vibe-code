# 📘 06 – Multi-Tool AI Agents

## 🚀 Why This Matters

A single AI agent is powerful, but it becomes transformative when it can **use multiple tools at once**.

Multi-tool AI agents can:

* Run calculations.
* Query databases.
* Execute code.
* Perform web searches.
* Write content.

> **Consultant Note:** Position multi-tool agents as **digital specialists** — they don’t just respond, they *act across systems* to solve complex problems.

## 🧩 What Are Multi-Tool Agents?

* **Definition:** AI agents enhanced with the ability to call different tools/services as needed.
* **Analogy:** A chatbot is like a vending machine, while a multi-tool AI agent is like a chef with a full kitchen — they can choose the right utensil for the job.

## 🛠️ Capabilities

1. **Math Tools** – Do calculations, analytics, and stats.
2. **Data Access Tools** – Query databases, spreadsheets, or APIs.
3. **Code Execution** – Run JavaScript/Python scripts for advanced processing.
4. **Web Search** – Fetch real-time information.
5. **Workflow Integration** – Orchestrate multiple steps across apps.

## 📂 Workflow Example – AI-Powered Sales Analyst

**Visual Flow (described):**

```
Webhook → AI Agent (Planner) → Database Query → Math Tool → Writing Tool → Email Node
```

---

### Step 1: Receive Task

* Input: “Find Q3 sales and draft an email about any dip from Q2.”

---

### Step 2: AI Agent Planning

* AI Agent decides it needs to:

  1. Query sales DB.
  2. Compare Q2 vs Q3.
  3. Write a summary email.

---

### Step 3: Database Query

* **Postgres Node** or **MySQL Node** → Run:

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) 
FROM sales 
WHERE quarter='Q2';
```

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) 
FROM sales 
WHERE quarter='Q3';
```

---

### Step 4: Math Tool

* Use **Function Node** to calculate % change:

```js
const q2 = $json["q2_sales"];
const q3 = $json["q3_sales"];
return { percentChange: ((q3 - q2) / q2) * 100 };
```

---

### Step 5: Writing Tool (AI Agent)

* AI Agent Node → Prompt:

```text
Write a professional email to executives summarizing sales performance. 
Highlight the {{$json.percentChange}}% change from Q2 to Q3. 
Keep the tone formal, concise, and actionable.
```

---

### Step 6: Email Output

* **Email Node** → Send summary to leadership team.

---

## 🎯 Business Use Cases

* **Finance:** Auto-generate reports combining DB queries + AI summaries.
* **Marketing:** Monitor campaign performance and draft reports.
* **Operations:** Pull data across systems and create actionable insights.
* **Customer Success:** Summarize usage data + draft outreach emails.

---

## 💡 Consultant Notes

* **Positioning:** Multi-tool agents are **digital analysts** — they don’t just chat, they *act*.
* **Pricing Strategy:** Package as high-value “executive assistants” that replace analyst hours.
* **Upsell Path:** Start with single-tool AI → graduate clients to multi-tool orchestration.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Multi-tool agents = AI agents + access to multiple utilities.
* n8n enables orchestration across DBs, APIs, and AI nodes.
* Example: Q2 vs Q3 sales analysis → % change → executive email.
* Consultants can sell this as **decision-grade automation**.
