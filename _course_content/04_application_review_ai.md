# 📘 04 – Application Review AI Workflow

## 🚀 Goal

Reviewing applications manually is slow and inconsistent. In this workflow, we’ll:

1. Capture applications via **Typeform**.
2. Save submissions into **Airtable**.
3. Use an **AI Agent** (OpenAI) to evaluate against criteria.
4. Send a **personalized response** automatically.

This transforms a **15-minute manual task** into a **30-second automated process**.

## 🛠️ Tools Needed

* **n8n** (Cloud or Self-Hosted)
* **Typeform** (for application intake)
* **Airtable** (for structured record-keeping)
* **OpenAI API Key** (to power the AI evaluation)
* **SMTP / Gmail** (for applicant email responses)

---

## 📂 Workflow Structure

**Visual Flow (described):**

```
Typeform Trigger → Airtable Create → AI Agent Node → Airtable Update → Email Node
```

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Capture Applications (Typeform Trigger)

1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Typeform Trigger Node**.

   * Connect your Typeform account.
   * Choose the “New Response” trigger.
3. Submit a sample form to test.

**Example Output JSON:**

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "followers": 8500,
  "revenue": 120000,
  "email": "jane@example.com"
}
```

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Save to Airtable

1. Add an **Airtable Node** → “Create Record”.
2. Map fields:

   * Name → `{{$json.name}}`
   * Followers → `{{$json.followers}}`
   * Revenue → `{{$json.revenue}}`
   * Email → `{{$json.email}}`

This ensures every application is logged in a central database.

---

## 🧩 Step 3: Evaluate with AI Agent

1. Add an **AI Agent Node** (OpenAI).
2. Choose model: `gpt-4` (or `gpt-3.5` for cost efficiency).
3. Configure **prompt**:

```text
You are evaluating an application for our program.  

Criteria:  
- At least 10k followers  
- At least $100k in revenue  

Applicant Data:  
Name: {{$json.name}}  
Followers: {{$json.followers}}  
Revenue: {{$json.revenue}}  

Tasks:  
1. Decide if qualified (Yes/No).  
2. Write a personalized response in Big Poppa Code’s voice.
```

**Example AI Output JSON:**

```json
{
  "qualified": "Yes",
  "message": "Jane, congrats! With 120k in revenue, you’re a perfect fit. Let’s build together."
}
```

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Update Airtable

1. Add another **Airtable Node** → “Update Record”.
2. Map fields:

   * Qualification → `{{$json.qualified}}`
   * Response Message → `{{$json.message}}`

Now Airtable stores both the **decision** and the **AI-generated reply**.

---

## 🧩 Step 5: Send Email Response

1. Add an **Email Node** (SMTP or Gmail).
2. To: `{{$json.email}}`.
3. Subject: `Your Application Results`.
4. Body: `{{$json.message}}`.

**Result:** Every applicant gets a **personalized email**, instantly.

---

## 🎯 Why This Workflow Is Powerful

* **Mimics Human Decisions** – AI applies your exact criteria.
* **Personalization at Scale** – Every response feels tailored.
* **Time Saved** – Process shrinks from 10–15 minutes to seconds.
* **Consistency** – No missed applicants, no human bias.

---

## 💡 Consultant Notes

When offering this as a **service** to businesses:

* **Discovery:** Ask how many hours their team spends reviewing apps.
* **Pitch:** “We’ll automate 90% of your application reviews and free your team for top candidates.”
* **Monetization:** Charge a setup fee + monthly retainer for monitoring and fine-tuning.

> **Strategic Framing:** You’re not just automating a form — you’re building a **digital recruiter** that makes judgment calls at scale.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

* Add a **“Not Qualified” rejection path** with a polite response.
* Notify your team in **Slack** when a VIP candidate applies.
* Push data into a **CRM** for ongoing relationship tracking.

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Workflow blends **Typeform, Airtable, AI Agent, and Email**.
* Criteria-based decisions handled by AI.
* Every applicant gets a **personalized response** automatically.
* Consultants can position this as a **digital labor solution**.
