## ðŸŒŸ Big Ideas You Learned

- **LLMs (Large Language Models)** are probability machines predicting the next token.  
- **ChatGPT** is a chat-based interface for working with these models.  
- **Prompts matter**: role, goal, context, constraints, and format drive better results.  
- **Limitations exist**: hallucinations, stale data, bias, context limits â€” and mitigation strategies are essential.  
- **Human-in-the-loop** is key: AI assists, you decide.

## ðŸ›  Skills You Now Have

- Explain what LLMs are in plain language.  
- Use ChatGPT for multi-turn conversation and refinement.  
- Write structured prompts using the **Prompt Scaffold**.  
- Recognize when to fact-check or add guardrails.  
- Build your own **Prompt Library** for daily use.

## ðŸ“‚ Where to Go Next

Your journey doesnâ€™t stop here. The next step is to **expand your library of prompts**.  
In the AI Plug Library, weâ€™ve curated a set of reusable, battle-tested prompts.

ðŸ‘‰ Go to the [Prompts Library](/prompts) and start applying what you learned.  
Save prompts that work for you. Refine them. Share them. Make them part of your workflow.

## âœ… Final Takeaway

Prompt engineering is not about writing one perfect prompt.  
Itâ€™s about **iterating, experimenting, and adapting**.  
The better you get at asking, the better AI becomes at helping.

Keep practicing. Keep experimenting. And keep building your **AI advantage**.
