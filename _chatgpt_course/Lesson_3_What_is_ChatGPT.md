# Lesson 3 – What is ChatGPT?

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define ChatGPT as a product built on Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Recognize its main features and interface.
- Use multi-turn chats to refine and improve answers.
- Apply ChatGPT to practical everyday use cases.

## Part 1: Explain

**ChatGPT** is a conversational interface for interacting with LLMs.  
It allows anyone to type natural language prompts and get responses in a chat format.

Key features include:
- **Conversational Memory (per session)**: Each message builds on the last, so the model adapts based on context.  
- **Prompt + Response Structure**: Users give instructions (prompts), and ChatGPT generates text (responses).  
- **Accessibility**: Available on web, mobile, and through an API for developers.  
- **Customization**: Users can provide instructions, roles, and tone preferences to shape answers.

Think of ChatGPT as an **AI-powered collaborator**. It doesn’t “know” things the way humans do, but it generates responses that feel intelligent because of its training on vast amounts of text.

## Part 2: Demonstrate

Try this inside ChatGPT:

Prompt:  
```
Draft a polite email asking for a meeting with a potential client next week.
```

Follow up with:  
```
Make it sound more casual and shorter.
```

Notice how ChatGPT refines its response based on your follow-up.  
This is the power of **multi-turn conversation**: you don’t need to restart each time — you can iteratively improve the answer.

---

## Part 3: Imitate

Practice asking ChatGPT to rewrite the same piece of text in different tones:

Example prompt:  
```
Rewrite this message in 3 styles:
1. Formal
2. Humorous
3. Persuasive
```

Observe how the wording, tone, and phrasing shift each time.

---

## Part 4: Practice

1. **Persona Setup**  
   At the start of a chat, set a role:  
   ```
   You are my research assistant. Always give concise, fact-based answers in bullet points.
   ```  
   → This sets expectations for the whole session.

2. **Multi-Turn Editing**  
   Ask ChatGPT to write a LinkedIn post. Then refine it:  
   - “Make it shorter.”  
   - “Add 3 relevant hashtags.”  
   - “Make the tone more inspirational.”  

3. **Save Time Daily**  
   - Draft an email response.  
   - Create meeting agendas.  
   - Summarize long articles.

## Analogies That Help

- **Digital collaborator:** Like having an intern who can draft text quickly.  
- **Brainstorming partner:** Helps generate ideas when you’re stuck.  
- **Swiss Army Knife of text:** Can switch roles, tones, and outputs with the right prompt.

---

## Exercises

- Write one prompt that saves you 10 minutes of work this week.  
- Test 3 tone shifts on the same prompt (e.g., formal, casual, witty).  
- Create a “persona instruction” for ChatGPT (e.g., career coach, editor, marketer) and see how it changes outputs.

## Key Takeaways

- ChatGPT is a **chat-based interface** for LLMs.  
- It supports **multi-turn conversations** where context carries over.  
- Effective use involves **setting roles, refining iteratively, and saving strong prompts**.  
- It shines as an **assistant for drafting, brainstorming, and editing text**.
