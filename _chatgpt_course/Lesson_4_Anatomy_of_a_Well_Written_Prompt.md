# Lesson 4 – Anatomy of a Well-Written Prompt

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the key components of an effective prompt.
- Apply a scaffold structure to turn vague prompts into strong ones.
- Understand why specificity and context improve results.
- Write prompts that consistently deliver useful outputs.

## Part 1: Explain

A well-written prompt is the difference between **confusing answers** and **precise, valuable output**.  
Think of it like giving directions: the clearer you are, the better the result.

**Key Components of a Strong Prompt:**
1. **Role** – Tell the model who it should be.  
2. **Goal** – Define the outcome you want.  
3. **Context** – Provide relevant details, background, or data.  
4. **Constraints** – Set boundaries like length, tone, or style.  
5. **Examples** – Show a sample or reference for guidance.  
6. **Output Format** – Specify exactly how you want the answer delivered.

## Part 2: Demonstrate

Bad prompt:  
```
Write a blog post.
```

Good prompt:  
```
You are a marketing writer.
Goal: Write a 500-word blog post on AI in healthcare.
Audience: startup founders.
Constraints: friendly tone, 3 subheadings, end with a call-to-action.
Output: Markdown format with headings.
```

Notice how much more structured and useful the second response will be.

## Part 3: Imitate

Take a vague idea and **scaffold it** into a strong prompt.

Example vague idea:  
“Write about remote work.”

Scaffold version:  
```
ROLE: You are a workplace consultant.
GOAL: Write a 700-word article about the benefits and challenges of remote work.
CONTEXT: Focus on productivity, work-life balance, and company culture.
CONSTRAINTS: Use clear headings, include 3 statistics, keep tone professional but friendly.
EXAMPLES: Reference Harvard Business Review style.
OUTPUT: Markdown with Introduction, 3 body sections, and a conclusion.
```

## Part 4: Practice

1. **Rewrite Vague Prompts**  
   - “Write an email.” → Add role, goal, audience, and constraints.  
   - “Summarize this article.” → Add length, output format, and intended audience.

2. **Test Formats**  
   Ask ChatGPT to return results as:  
   - A table.  
   - Bullet points.  
   - JSON data.  

3. **Experiment with Constraints**  
   Example:  
   ```
   Write a 50-word story about space exploration.
   ```  
   Then:  
   ```
   Write a 500-word story about space exploration with 3 characters and a plot twist.
   ```  
   Compare results.

## Prompt Scaffold Template

Copy and reuse this structure for reliable outputs:

```
ROLE: You are a [role].
GOAL: Produce [deliverable] for [audience].
CONTEXT: [facts, background, data].
CONSTRAINTS: [length, style, tone, do/don’t].
EXAMPLES: [mini sample if possible].
OUTPUT: [format or structure required].
CLARIFY: Ask up to 3 questions if information is missing.
```

## Analogies That Help

- **Cooking Recipe:** If you give vague directions (“make food”), results vary. If you specify ingredients, steps, and style, the dish is consistent.  
- **GPS Navigation:** Without a clear destination, you wander. With exact coordinates, you arrive where you want.  
- **Hiring an Employee:** Clear job description → better performance. Vague description → confusion.

---

## Exercises

- Rewrite 2 vague prompts into strong prompts using the scaffold.  
- Build a reusable prompt for your daily workflow (emails, reports, social media).  
- Test the same task with 3 different formats (table, essay, list).  

---

## Key Takeaways

- Clear prompts = better answers.  
- Always include role, goal, context, constraints, and output format.  
- Examples help guide tone and structure.  
- The **Prompt Scaffold** is your reusable framework for success.
